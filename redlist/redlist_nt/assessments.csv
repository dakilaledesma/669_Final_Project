495630,10030,Hexanchus griseus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (<em>Hexanchus griseus</em>)&#160;is a large (to 550 cm total length) deep-water shark known with a global yet patchy distribution. It occurs in tropical, temperate and boreal&#160;waters off continental slopes and shelves, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly at depths of 200–1,100 m.&#160;It has large litters but an estimated late age-at-maturity that reduces its capacity to recover from fishing pressure. The species is infrequently caught incidentally in deep-water industrial and artisanal&#160; fisheries across its range.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range and increases in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.&#160;The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (160 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p><strong><br/></strong>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is&#160;demersal in tropical, temperate and boreal waters on the slope, shelf, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly 200–1,100 m&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Griffing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weigmann 2016).&#160;It also occurs on seamounts and mid-ocean ridges and is often associated areas of high biological productivity and upwelling (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 550 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016); males mature at ~309–330 cm TL and females mature at 350–420 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Reproduction is aplacental viviparous&#160;with litter sizes of 47–108, and size-at-birth is estimated at 61–74 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013)<a>. Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 26.5 years and maximum age is estimated at 80 years (COSEWIC 2007), resulting in a generation length of 53 years. This study has not been validated and estimates should be used with caution.&#160;</a></span></p>","<p>The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is infrequently reported as targeted and incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, longline, handline, traps, and gillnet fisheries across its range (e.g. Celona <em>et al</em>. 2005, White and Dharmadi 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The species is also targeted by recreational fishers (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Post-release mortality for the species is likely to be low (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017), and the species is mostly discarded (Silva and Ellis 2019). <br/><br/>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl and longline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with medium risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and relative biomass in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (160 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis of the CPUE and relative abundance estimates from the Northeast Atlantic over 21 years between 1998–2018 (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.4%, consistent with an estimated increase of 80.4% over three generation lengths (160 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the past three generation lengths. <br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, video surveillance and dive encounter rates in the Strait of Georgia showed large declines in sightings between 1999–2005 (COSEWIC 2007). A decline is sightings were also reported from Elliott Bay, Puget Sound between 2003–2005 and 2008–2015 (Griffing <em>et al. 2</em>019). However, these observed declines are not thought to be representative of true reduction in population and may be attributed to environmental or behavioural factors, or natural variability of juvenile recruitment (COSEWIC 2007, Griffing <em>et al</em>. 2019). Genetic studies in Puget Sound suggest the local stock is fairly large (Larson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), but there is apparent cohort-specific, broad variation in abundance (Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, the species was targeted in the deep-water fisheries in the Maldives before stocks collapsed and were replaced with a fishery for gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp) (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). The gulper shark fishery also collapsed over a short period of time (20 years) (Ali 2015); while there are no data available, the rapid decline of the gulper shark fishery may be indicative of the duration of the former targeted fishery for the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark prior to the collapse of stocks. <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, abundance indices from CPUE data of the species landed at Cilacap-Central Java and Tanjung Luar, Indonesia show no trends between 2014–2018, but only a small number of individuals were caught&#160;(Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>The species is infrequently reported across much of its range including past and/or present targeted shark fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018), the Mediterranean (Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), east and west Africa (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), Indonesia (Blaber<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009,&#160;White and Dharmadi 2010),&#160;and Australia (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001,&#160;Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;It is likely to have some refuge at depth in parts of its range. Based on documented declines in part of its range (Maldives) and increasing trends in others (Northeast Atlantic), overlap with fishing pressure and refuge at depth, a global population reduction of 20–29% was estimated over three generation lengths (160 years). Therefore, the Bluntnose Sixgill&#160;Shark&#160;is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, distribution across all oceans&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).<p><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p>","<p>The species is utilized for its meat, liver oil, cartilage, and fish meal (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Akhilesh and Ganga&#160;2013). In the early 20th century, the species was also utilized for its leather (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Given its large size, its meat, fins, and liver oil can fetch high market prices in some places (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). Its fins have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p><br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005. <br/><br/>The Maldives has a general ban on shark fishing since 1998 which affords this deep-sea species protection from fisheries exploitation within that range (<a>Ali</a>&#160;2015). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range. In Canada, the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is listed as a species of Special Concern under the&#160;Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2009 and by&#160;the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2007 and a management plan under SARA was developed to ensure the recovery and conservation of the species (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012).&#160;Further research is needed on population size and trends of the species, and catches should be monitored.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global
887942,161403,Somniosus pacificus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2021,2019-08-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>) is a large (to 700 cm total length) deep-water sleeper shark that occurs in the North Pacific Ocean from Taiwan, north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic and across the Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands, to Baja California, Mexico. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m. The species is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded, though may be retained for the liver oil, and for the meat in Taiwan. The species is occasionally observed in Japan and is now rarely captured in Taiwan, with a possible decline over the past 18 years. Russian survey data suggest catches have increased slightly over the past 40 years across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific. In the Northeast Pacific, the catch estimate trend is uncertain; the relative abundance may have declined over the past 21 years; however, the observed decline may be due to a reduction in catchability. Mainly immature animals are captured across its range, with fewer adults encountered which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in fishing gear, possibly due to their large size. Large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay and Baja California. It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity, it is suspected that the Pacific Sleeper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd.","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m (Weigmann 2016). At high latitudes with cold surface waters, it ranges into the littoral and even the intertidal (one large individual was found trapped in a tide pool) as well as at the surface; however, in lower latitudes with temperate water it becomes a deep-water, epibenthic shark, never coming to the surface and ranging to a depth of 2,008 m in the extreme southern end of its range (off Baja California) (Compagno 1984). Tagging studies in the Northeast Pacific showed some Pacific Sleeper Sharks undertake regular diurnal vertical migrations from below the photic zone during the day to near the surface at night (Hulbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). It reaches an estimated maximum size of 700 cm total length (TL), males mature at 385 cm TL and females mature at 365 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 1987, Wang and Yang 2004, Yano <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Reproduction is probably viviparous with a size-at-birth estimated at 40 cm TL (Yano <em>et al</em>. 2007). Age parameters are unknown, and it is likely that the generation length is similar to that of the Greenland Shark which is suspected of a generation length similar to other deep-water sharks, that is, 50–75 years (Kulka <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded. Post-release mortality is unknown but has been conservatively estimated as 100% (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). It is captured in recreational fisheries in the Southeast and Southcentral Alaska, however the catch is uncommon and rarely retained (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen et al. 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Japan, prior to World War I, fisheries from the early 1800s targeted mainly Pacific Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) and in the Bering Sea, they mainly operated in the waters above the continental shelf and slope of the Bering Sea (Hayashi 1991). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). Deep-water trawl fisheries across Japan mostly operate at 200–800 m but in some parts of northern Japan, they operate to 1,500 m. Deep-water longline fisheries mostly operate at depths of 400–800 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Russian survey catch data from 1980 to 2014 indicated this species was caught in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and in the Pacific Ocean with demersal and mid-water trawls with catches ranging from 1 to 67 individuals per trawl and a total of 798 individuals captured over the 35 years (I. Volvenko unpubl data 2019). In Russia, prior to World War I, fisheries mostly operated in inland waters. During the 1930s, fisheries gradually shifted to coastal waters and expanded to marine waters and foreign fleets during the late 1940s to early 1950s with fishing in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and western Bering Sea and further in the 1960s to the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska targeting herring and bottom fish with large, factory stern trawlers (Pruter 1976).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, from 1860 to 1920, fisheries mostly targeted Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) with pelagic fisheries increasing in effort between World War I and II and sharks (Squaliformes) a minor component of the catch (Diemling <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), Pacific Sleeper Shark are now captured mainly in the Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) longline and the Walleye Pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>) trawl fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In the Gulf of Alaska, the species is mainly captured in the flatfish fisheries and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) longline fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>The species may be caught as bycatch on the Emperor Seamounts. The fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).<span><span

Sleeper Shark catches across the North Pacific from the Sea of Okhotsk to the United States west coast are mostly of small and immature animals (50–200 cm total length, TL) with fewer captures of individuals &gt;200 cm TL reported. Occasional catches of animals up to 400 cm TL have been reported from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and United States west coast (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a), and large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay, off California and off Baja California (D.A. Ebert unpubl. data 2021). The lesser number of large and mature animals captured in industrial fisheries and research surveys suggests that most adults inhabit depths beyond the reach of industrial and survey fishing gear or that the adults occur in nearshore habitats but are less susceptible to capture in the gear than smaller individuals (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is sometimes observed on deep-water bait cameras in Suruga Bay and Sagami Bay (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, this species was caught previously caught in a small, localised deep-water longline fishery till 2002, but is now a rare bycatch with the decline in catches of concern, particularly as most of the catch was of large sub-adults and adults &gt;200 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013b. H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). Russian survey data suggest catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark have increased slightly across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific from 1980 to 2019, in terms of both abundance and biomass (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). The species is considered common in the southeast of Sakhalin Island (Dyldin and Orlov 2018).<br/><br/>In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the GOA, the Pacific Sleeper Shark is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). There are no data to determine if the stock is overfished (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). Pacific Sleeper Shark catch in the BSAI was estimated to have averaged 136 t annually for 2003–2020; the method of catch estimation changed in 2003 and catch estimations prior to that were based on limited data (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). The species' catch in the GOA was estimated to have averaged 199 t annually from 1997 to 2020; the same change in catch estimation methods occurred in the GOA in 2003, however GOA catch estimates are informed by more data prior to 2003 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). There may be underestimation of estimated weights of Pacific Sleeper Shark captured in the BSAI and GOA from longline vessels, as weights based on observer data are generally from smaller individuals because animals &gt;50 kg cannot be weighed at sea and are difficult to bring on board (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Trawl survey indices of relative abundance of Pacific Sleeper Sharks are less reliable than longline survey estimates as even immature animals are large and mostly avoid trawl gear and catches are often based on a small number of trawls and small numbers of individuals within a trawl; hence trawl estimates are not considered a reliable index for this species (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE, numbers caught per effective hook) from the International Pacific Halibut Commission annual longline surveys in the BSAI and GOA declined over 24 years from 1997 to 2020 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a, IPHC 2020). Catches were lower in Canada and the United States west coast and no CPUE trends in those areas were evident (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The decline observed in the BSAI and GOA indicated that either abundance was declining or that the distribution of the Pacific Sleeper Sharks may have altered over time making them less available to capture (Tribuzio et al. 2020a). Despite the potential decline in abundance and uncertainty in catch estimates, overall current catches of this species in both the BSAI and GOA are considered well below the acceptable biological catch levels (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>Overall, the species is occasionally observed in Japan and now rarely captured in Taiwan with possible declines over the past 18 years. The population is estimated to have increased slightly over the past 40 years in the Northwest Pacific, and in the Northeast Pacific the population trend is uncertain; the population may have declined over the past 21 years, however the observed decline in CPUE may be due to a reduction in catchability. Catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark across the North Pacific are mostly of small and immature animals, with fewer adults captured which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or that they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in the gear, possibly due to their large size. The threats to the species appear to have commenced during the 1940s (1–1.5 generation lengths ago) and it previously was estimated to have increased in biomass in the western Bering Sea from 1999 to 2006 with fluctuations in the eastern Bering Sea possibly due to sampling changes or species movements rather than population changes (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity as it is a deep-water species, it is suspected that the population has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark occurs in the North Pacific in the Northwest, Northeast, and Eastern Central Pacific from Taiwan to Baja California, Mexico, including the Hawaiian Islands. It also occurs north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic Sea (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Kang <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Its distribution above the Arctic Circle is unclear, and it may be misidentified with the Greenland Shark (<em>S. microcephalus</em>). Large sleeper sharks identified as the Pacific Sleeper Shark from the Southern Hemisphere are most likely that of Southern Sleeper Shark (<em>S. antarcticus</em>) (Ebert 2003, Yano <em>et al</em>. 2004).","The liver oil is used but in most places the meat is not used as it contains toxins, similar to that of the Greenland Shark (Dyldin and Orlov 2018). Despite the toxins, the meat of this species is consumed fresh in Taiwan as a replacement for Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) meat as it has a similar consistency (Wang and Yang 2004).",Marine,"In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), the Sleeper Shark has been managed since 2011 as part of the shark stock complex that includes the Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus suckleyi</em>) and the Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) under the BSAI and GOA Fishery Management Plans; a total allowable catch, accepted biological catch, and overfishing limits are set and revised biennially for the stock complex (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). The recreational fishing limit in the State of Alaska for combined Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and Squaliformes is a daily bag limit of one shark with an annual limit of two sharks per year (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, there are no species-specific measures. In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). Demersal fisheries in the Emperor Seamount Chain are managed by interim conservation measures of the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) and voluntary measures of NPFC Members, that include time-area closures, effort controls, and capacity limits (CHM 2016). Throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, there are a series of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) referred to as Bottomfish Restricted Fishing Areas (DLNR 2019). These are generally closed to industrial and recreational bottom fishing and may offer the species refuge. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>","",,false,false,Global

Narrowfin Smoothhound is demersal on the continental shelf over sandy and muddy substrates at depths of 0–260 m, although it mostly occurs at depths less than 55 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013,Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 98 cm total length (TL), males mature at 57–69 cm TL and females at 65–77 cm TL (Ebert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2017). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 7–14 pups and size-at-birth of 29–30 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).<span lang=""en-AU""><span lang=""en-AU""> Female age-at-maturity is 4.1 years and maximum observed age is 9 years; generation length is therefore 6.6 years (Jones&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).<span lang=""en-AU""><br/><br/><span lang=""en-AU""></span></span>","<p>The Narrowfin Smoothhound is captured in recreational fisheries, commercial trawl fisheries and in commercial and artisanal driftnets, gillnets, and longlines. In the United States (US), combined <em>Mustelus</em> spp. landings averaged ~33,000 individuals in recreational fisheries from 2012–2016. Commercial landings were 318 metric t dressed weight in 2016. However, total landings for this species are likely much lower as these are summarized for combined <em>Mustelus</em> spp. from both the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In the Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia pers. comm. 14 July 2018) but at the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). The Narrowfin Smoothhound is caught on longlines and in gillnets there in lower numbers now than in the past (Tavares 2005). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense and unmanaged, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). Overall, this shark is captured in managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico, but elsewhere is subjected to unmanaged commercial and artisanal fishing pressure, and the population is not monitored.</p>

890428,161524,Carcharhinus isodon,Near Threatened,A2bd,2021,2019-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Finetooth Shark (<em>Carcharhinus isodon</em>)&#160;is a medium-sized (to 200 cm total length) coastal shark found in the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from North Carolina (USA), to the Gulf of Mexico and isolated areas in the Caribbean Sea and down to Brazil. It occurs off beaches, in bays, estuaries and river mouths&#160;from the intertidal to a depth of 20 m. It is caught as target catch and bycatch of coastal commercial fisheries primarily for meat.<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic, where management exists, Finetooth Shark has annually increased by 3.5% with the median change over three generation lengths (23 years) and corresponding probabilities for rates of population change all indicate an increasing population. However, in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, this species was formerly common in the 1970s and 1980s but due to the intense unmanaged fishing pressure there have been few records of this species in the past decade. Consequently, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) in the Southwest Atlantic portion of its range.<br/><br/>Overall, due to Brazil occupying about 20% of its overall global range and the increasing population in the Northwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the Finetooth Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Finetooth Shark occurs off beaches, in bays, estuaries and off river mouths&#160;from the intertidal to depths of ~20 m (Castro 2011).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 189–200 cm total length (TL), males mature at 133 cm TL and females mature at 125–135 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 1–6 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 55–58 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Estimates of size and age-at-maturity for male and female sharks from the Gulf of Mexico were different from those in the United States (US) Atlantic (Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003, Drymon <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Female age-at-maturity was 4.2 and 6.2 years, and&#160; maximum age was 8.2 and 12.3 in the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, respectively (Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Drymon <em>et al.</em> 2006); an average of the two respective generation lengths is 7.65 years.<br/><p><br/></p>","In the United States (US), Finetooth Shark is captured in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. It is targeted in recreational fisheries particularly in the southeast United States. In 2000, estimated commercial landings were 69,258 lbs dressed weight while recreational catches of small coastal sharks were 86,167 lbs (Cortés 2002). In 2015, US commercial landings were&#160;8,712 lbs (dressed weight) with 326 individuals landed recreationally (NMFS 2017).<br/><br/>Fisheries in Brazil include extensive subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries that are economically important for the country’s large population. Industrial gears include trawls, seines, gillnets, longlines, and handlines (Freire <em>et al. </em>2015). Artisanal fisheries are dominated by driftnetting and to a lesser extent shrimp fishing (Freire <em>et al.</em> 2015). Many artisanal fishers use both gillnets and longlines. Elasmobranchs are a bycatch in much of Brazil, and in some places, they are targeted. Brazil is one of the major shark meat consuming nations in the world (R. Barretto pers. comm. 30/06/2018). In Maranhão State, elasmobranchs made up 60% of the total catch between 1970 and 1980. In the past (from 1990–2010) the market for shark products has been largely for the fin trade and fins have been exported to Hong Kong for a high price (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2020). Recently this trade has shifted, and the demand and price of shark meat locally have increased substantially to surpass that of fins (Martins<em> et al.</em> 2018). According to fisher interviews, the value of shark fins in the state of Maranhão has declined by 85% since 2005 (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2018). Shark meat is consumed locally fresh or dried and salted. Species commonly caught in artisanal fisheries include Blacknose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus acronotus</em>), Bull Shark (<em>C. leucas</em>), Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>), Tiger Shark (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier)</em>, Atlantic Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>), Caribbean Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon porosus</em>), and hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.), many of which are threatened (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2018). Fishers in Maranhão state have consistently reported declines in shark populations despite increased effort. These fishers also indicated that some species (Smalltail Shark, and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>)) were previously abundant and are now very rare, and are likely at a high risk of local extinction (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Martins <em>et al. </em>2018, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). Species such as angel sharks (<em>Squatina</em> spp.) and guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) have also declined substantially (R. Barretto pers. comm. 30 May 2018). Brazil is one of the world’s top importers of shark meat. Imports have increased more than eight-fold since 2000 (Dent and Clarke 2015). This increase in imports indicates a growing market in Brazil and could potentially be indicative of depleted domestic stocks. Overall the fisheries catch in Brazil is increasingly coming from overexploited stocks, and the number of overexploited and collapsed stocks has increased, especially since the 1980s (Pauly and Zeller 2015).&#160;<br/><strong></strong>","Population trend data are available from broad-scale trends in relative abundance study for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (Peterson <em>et al. </em>2017). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al.</em> 2018, 2020; Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the attached Supplementary Information).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic Ocean,&#160;the relative abundance time series from multiple data sources from 1996 to 2014 indicated that abundance has increased at an annual rate of 3.5%. The median change over the past three generation lengths (23 years) and corresponding probabilities for rates of population change all indicate an increasing population. Previously, a stock assessment conducted in 2007 indicated that the current status of the population is above maximum sustainable yield and no overfishing is occurring (Cortés 2007).<br/><br/>In southern Brazil, the intense fisheries this species has been exposed to were suspected to have driven the species to extinction in the area, and this species was assessed in 2012 as Regionally Extinct by the Brazilian Government. There are, however, records the&#160;Brazil Ministry of the Environment were not aware of. For example, five individuals were captured on research cruises between 1992 and 2004, and a further record in Brazil (likely the most recent one) was confirmed in 2007 (F. Motta unpubl. data 22/05/2018). This species was common in the 1970s and 1980s, but due to the intense unmanaged fishing pressure and the lack of records for over a decade in Brazil, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population size reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) in the Southwest Atlantic.",Stable,"The Finetooth Shark is found in the Northwest, Western Central, and Southwest Atlantic Oceans. It ranges from North Carolina to north Florida to Texas in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Southwest Atlantic, it is known from São Paulo to Santa Catarina States in southern Brazil (Soto 2001, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It is also reported from isolated areas in the Caribbean such as Trinidad and Guyana (Castro 2011). Records from Cuba and West Africa are misidentifications (Castro 2011).","The Finetooth Shark is harvested commercially and recreationally and utilized primarily for meat. Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015, Finetooth Shark comprised 0.09–0.13% of the fin trade (Fields&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018, Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2020).",Marine,"In July 2006, the United States National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan.

There are also coastal gillnet bans in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas which will also provide protection for the species. In Brazil, there has been a finning ban in place since 1998 and a National Plan of Action (NPOA) for sharks and rays was implemented in 2014.

890724,161564,Carcharhinus altimus,Near Threatened,A2d,2020,2020-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bignose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus altimus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 300 cm total length) shark  that is patchily distributed in warm temperate and tropical waters worldwide. It inhabits continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 0–810 m, with young mostly inshore and adults offshore close to the seafloor during the day and near the surface at night. The species is taken as bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with pelagic longline and purse seine, trawl, and gillnet, and is retained for the meat and fins. The population declined significantly over 30 years where it was previously targeted in the Maldives, prior to closure of the fishery in 2010. The population is suspected to have declined by 20–29% in the Northwest Atlantic and by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas over three generation lengths (60 years) due to fishing pressure. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific data however it is subject to intense and  unregulated fishing pressure across approximately half of its range and has a low  biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries. There is lesser fishing pressure in the other half of its range where  there are managed fisheries. It is suspected that the Bignose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2d.","The Bignose Shark occurs in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves and upper continental slopes at depths of 0–810 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). The young tend to occur in shallow waters to depths of 25 m while the adults are more common offshore in deeper waters; they are found close to the seafloor during the day and often diurnally migrate to the surface at night (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Last and Stevens 2009, Henderson and Reeve 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, White<em> et al. </em>2017). It reaches a maximum size of 300 cm total length (TL), males mature at 190 cm TL and females mature at 205 cm TL (Crow <em>et al.</em> 1996, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 3–15, a biennial reproductive cycle and size at birth of 60–90 cm (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Preliminary verified age parameters indicate female age-at-maturity of 17 years and maximum age of 23 years; generation length is therefore 20 years (Jensen <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The Bignose Shark is caught globally as mostly bycatch in pelagic longline and purse seine, gillnet, and bottom trawl fisheries and generally retained for the meat and fins (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). Its migratory behaviour from the seafloor to shallow waters at night increases its susceptibility to capture in the widespread pelagic tuna fisheries. Commercial at-vessel-mortality in pelagic longline fisheries is highly variable ranging from 0–60% (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). Under-reporting of this species is also likely due to misidentification as the Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>).<br/><br/> In the United States (US) pelagic longline fishery (east coast of the US, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean), this species represented 5.3% of the catch from 1987–2010 based on fisher logbook data (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2018).  It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT  longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility  (Arrizabalaga <em>et al. </em>2011), However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with no reported captures from 2010–2017 (ICCAT 2018). It was taken in directed artisanal fisheries in the Central Mexican Pacific during the mid-1990s (Pérez-Jiménez e<em>t al. </em>2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, off Brazil, the Bignose Shark&#160;is taken  incidentally by commercial fisheries on the outer continental shelf and  continental slope. The species was first identified and recorded from  the catches of tuna longliners operating out of Santos (São Paulo State,  southern Brazil) by Sadowsky and Amorim (1977). It is seldom caught by  this fleet but retained when caught and sold as ""other sharks"" (Arfelli  and Amorim 1994). This species was also taken in directed artisanal shark  longline fisheries around the Venezuelan oceanic islands in 1997–1998 (Tavares 2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/> In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the  pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005). In West African waters, the Bignose Shark is infrequently caught (Diop  and Dossa 2011). In South Africa, it has been only reported as captured  in the bather protection programme (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>The Bignose Shark&#160;is taken in tuna fisheries and bottom trawls in the  Western Indian Ocean and probably by line or gillnet off India; there  are only isolated reports of its occurrence in Indian waters and in the  Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) longline fisheries where it is rarely reported (Kizhakudan <em>et al. </em>2015, IOTC 2018, E. Romanov pers. comm.&#160;09/02/2017). It was taken by nearshore pelagic longline around the Maldives where catch rates were reported by fishermen to have declined significantly (C.  Anderson pers. comm. 25/05/2007);<strong> </strong>however, shark fishing in the Maldives has been banned since 2010. Whole  individuals are consumed and traded at local markets in the Philippines  (SEAFDEC 2006). In  Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught occasionally by shark longline, gillnet, and coastal fishers (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>It is taken in the Western Central Pacific Ocean in  longline and purse seine gears but only in low numbers of &lt; 5  individuals per purse seine set and mostly &lt;5 individuals per 1,000  longline hooks (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). It is infrequently  captured in beach meshing programs in Australia, accounting for &lt;0.1%  of the total shark catch from 1962–2017 (Roff<em> et al. </em>2018). It has also been reported in low numbers from the West Australian Pilbara Fish Trawl Fishery (McAuley <em>et al. </em>2005).","There are no robust species-specific time series available for this species. It was targeted in a pelagic longline fishery in the Maldives and was considered relatively common in the 1970s and 1980s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Sattar <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, catch rates reported by fishermen declined significantly in the years leading up to 2007 followed by the closure of the fishery in 2010 (C. Anderson, pers. comm. 25/07/2007, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic, although there were no species-specific data, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over three generation lengths (60 years) due to longline fisheries (Pillans <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (60 years) due to its large size, valuable fins, susceptibility to fisheries, and intensive fisheries (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort in some areas leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan and Yemen were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002). Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016), likely as a result of dramatic increases in fishing pressure. The number of trawlers  operating in the Indian state of Gujarat (one of the major shark catching regions) has almost doubled between 2000 and 2010 from ~6,600 to 11,582 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004, CMFRI 2010). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, catches of sharks are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to maintain catches (Chen 1996). For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to  waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T.  White, pers. comm. 25/08/2007). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Bignose Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Overall, due to documented declines where it was previously targeted, intense and unregulated fishing pressure across approximately half of&#160; its range along with low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries, balanced with lesser fishing pressure in the  other half of its range where there are managed fisheries, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).",Decreasing,"The Bignose Shark has a circumglobal but patchy distribution (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Duffy and Struthers 2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2017).","The species is used for its meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and cartilage; the fins of adults are large and of high-value (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Last and Stevens 2009, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018).",Marine,"In United States waters, the Bignose Shark has been a prohibited species, at least  since 2007 and is now prohibited under the Consolidated Atlantic Highly  Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan (NMFS 2007, NOAA 2014). Targeted shark fishing has been banned in the Maldives Exclusive Economic Zone since 2010.  Globally, there are no international catch limits in place for Bignose Sharks. To prevent future overfishing, it is recommended that Bignose Sharks be subject  to regional and national catch limits based on scientific advice and/or  the precautionary approach, as well as improved reporting of catch and  discard data, and efforts to minimize bycatch mortality. Further research is needed on population size and trends, and life history.","",,false,false,Global

The high economic value of <em>D. angolensis</em> could drive its overexploitation as the open-access nature of Ghanian fisheries is considered to be unsustainable. There have been recorded annual declines of more than 10% in Mauritania for this species,&#160;while biomass&#160;ratios over 25 years indicate&#160;a 20-fold decrease for three fished species of the Mauritanian shelf,&#160;<em>D. angolensis</em>,&#160;<em>Epinephelus aeneus&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>Citharus linguatula. </em>This species exhibits a specialized reproductive characteristic (protogynous hermaphroditism) that may make it more vulnerable to overexploitation. Given that demersal biomass over the Mauritanian shelf declined by 75% over 25 years, we estimate that it declined by at least 60% in three generation lengths (=15 years) based on generation time estimates of a congener, <em>D. maroccanus</em>. Additionally, abundance declined by 15% annually from 1989-2006.&#160;We suspect that annual declines recorded off of Mauritania are comparable to other countries in West Africa given the importance of this species in the demersal fishery and the overall declining trend of fisheries in the region.&#160;Although&#160;<em>D. angolensis&#160;</em>has wide geographical and depth distributions, this species is highly prized in the region and we suspect that fishing effort is only going to increase or remain the same in West Africa. Therefore, we infer that this species has declined by 20-25% in the last three generations (=15 years) and will approach reductions of at least 30% within the next 5-10 years, nearing thresholds for Vulnerable under A2 and A4. This species is therefore listed as Near Threatened under A2d+A4d. We recommend close monitoring of the population status and harvest levels of this species.","<em>Dentex angolensis</em>&#160;exhibits benthopelagic and demersal behaviors.

Annual declines of 10% have been recorded for this species off Mauritania.&#160;The wild-caught economic value of this species could drive their overexploitation as the open-access nature of Ghanian fisheries is not sustainable and management reform is overdue (Aheto <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;It is recommended that studies focused on the reproduction and growth of this highly valued species be instituted for aquaculture purposes.,"Demersal biomass has been reduced by 75% on the Mauritanian continental shelf over the past 25 years, corresponding to a biomass loss of about 20,000 tonnes per year. In Mauritania, this species is among those for which abundance decreases were quite marked for the period 1989-2006, showing annual declines of more than 15 %.&#160;An analysis of trawl-survey data from the area revealed&#160;annual declines of 10% or more for&#160;<em>D. angolensis</em>,<em>&#160;</em>while biomass&#160;ratios between the earliest and the most recent years indicate&#160;a 20-fold decrease for three fished species of the Mauritanian shelf,&#160;<em>D. angolensis</em>, <em>Epinephelus aeneus </em>and <em>Citharus linguatula&#160;</em>(Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).

It undertakes extensive migrations between coastal waters in summer and offshore waters in winter, migrating north and inshore to spawn in spring. It is caught in the commercial otter trawl and recreational fishery. Steady decline of commercial landings and recent decline in recreational landings have been recorded. Furthermore, there are&#160;indications that the spawning stock is in an overfished condition. Based on recorded past declines and the popularity of this species in commercial and recreational fisheries, we infer that it could approach 30% population declines in 24 years (three generation lengths).&#160;It is therefore listed as Near Threatened under A3b. However, we note that this species is managed by the&#160;Summer Flounder, Scup and Black Sea Bass Fishery Management Plan (FMP) administered jointly by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), and by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) with regulatory provisions including&#160;annual commercial quotas, recreational harvest limits, permit requirements, minimum fish size and gear restrictions, and a recreational fishery possession limit. It is recommended that more research and monitoring be undertaken to accurately assess the status of the stock and the assessment reviewed as more up-to-date population information become available.","<em>Stenotomus chrysops </em>occurs over the continental shelf,&#160;forming schools of similar-sized individuals                  in areas with smooth, rough or rocky bottoms. This species is particularly plentiful                  around piers, rocks, offshore ledges, jetties and mussel beds.&#160;<em>Stenotomus chrysops</em>&#160;undertakes extensive migrations between                     coastal waters in summer and offshore waters in winter, migrating                     north and inshore to spawn in spring (Northeast Fisheries Science Center 2006, Terceiro 2012). Young larvae inhabit very shallow estuarine waters while juveniles and                  adults move into harbours and along sandy beaches during high                  tides, and then into deeper channels as the tides recede. Larger individuals generally occur farther offshore than do smaller, younger                  ones (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries accessed 2009). The <em>S. chrysrops</em>&#160;population of the Middle Atlantic Bight makes extensive seasonal migrations with a few fish tagged and caught south of Cape Hatteras (Nesbit and Neville 1935, Frankelstein 1971).&#160;This species is found in areas with water temperatures greater than 45°F and most commonly found in water temperatures from 55° to 77°F. Adults of this species                  feed upon bottom invertebrates including small crabs, annelid                  worms, clams, mussels, jellyfish, and sand dollars (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries accessed 2009). The mean fecundity for <em>S. chrysops</em> is about 7,000 ova per female (Gray 1990).&#160;<p><strong>Reproduction</strong></p><p><em>Stenotomus chrysops</em>&#160;spawns once a year starting in spring during the inshore migration (Kendall 1973) and then occurs&#160;from May through August and peaks in June (Terceiro 2012). The age at 50% maturity for&#160;<em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;is around two years and a length of about 17 cm TL (Morse 1978) with almost all individuals mature at age three at a length of 21 cm TL (Terceiro 2012).&#160;<em>Stenotomus chrysops </em>can reach 41 cm total length and at least 14 years of age with a likely maximum of about 20 years (Dery and Rearden 1979). Larvae of this species are pelagic at about two mm TL when newly hatched. Larvae are dependent on their yolk for about three days until they reach about 2.8 mm TL and active feeding begins (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953).&#160;</p><p>Generation length for <em>S. chrysops</em> is estimated to be about eight years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>&#160;</p>","<em>Stenotomus chrysops </em>is an important recreational and commercial species with&#160;declines in landings and SSB observed in the past. This species was previously believed to be overfished but has made some recovery due to reduced fishing mortality, improved recruitment and the implementation of broad scale Gear Restricted Areas (Steimle <em>et al.</em> 1999, Terceiro 2012, Linton and Terceiro 2013).","<em>Stenotomus chrysops</em> is abundant in parts of its range (Love and Chase 2007) and is very common off the Carolinas and Georgia (G. Sedberry pers. comm. 2014). Commercial landings of <em>S.&#160;chrysops</em>&#160;in the Middle Atlantic&#160;Bight have declined substantially since peak landings in&#160;the 1950s and early 1960s, although, there was a minor&#160;peak in landings in the early 1980s (Northeast&#160;Fisheries Science Center 1997). Recreational landings&#160;have also declined (Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council 1996, Steimle <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Based on a 2012 stock assessment, <em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;is not overfished and overfishing&#160;was not occurring in 2011 as fishing mortality was estimated below the fishing mortality threshold reference point (Terceiro 2012). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) of this species decreased from about 100,000 mt in 1963 to about 50,000 mt in 1969 and subsequently increased to about 75,000 mt in the 1970s. SSB declined through the 1980s and 1990s to less than 5,000 mt but by 2004 SSB had increased to over 100,000 mt due to improved recruitment and reduced fishing mortality (Terceiro 2012). The average size of <em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;has declined significantly since the 1930s (Smith and Norcross 1968).&#160;<br/><br/>Landings of&#160;<em>Stenotomus chrysops&#160;</em>decreased from over 18,000 mt in 1963 to less than 10,000 mt in the late 1960s and subsequently fluctuated between ~5,000 mt and ~10,000 mt from 1970 to the early 1990s and decreased to about 1,200 mt in the years 2000. In more recent years, commercial landings averaged about 6,000 mt from 2010 to 2012 with reported 2012 landings in the commercial fishery at 7,122 mt, which is about 56% if the commercial quota. From 1979 to 2012, about 80% of the commercial landings were in Rhodes Island (38%), New Jersey (24%), and New York (18%). The primary gear used to fish&#160;<em>S. chrysops&#160;</em>is the otter trawl and comprised about 76% of the total catch since 1979 with the rest of the catch taken by floating trap (10%); hand lines (6%); and paired trawl, pound nets, and pots and traps comprising about 1% to 3% (Linton and Terceiro 2013).&#160;<em>Stenotomus chrysops&#160;</em>is also a major component in the recreational fishery with the greatest proportion of catches taken in Massachusetts, Rhodes Island, Connecticut, and New York. Estimated recreational landings (excluding estimates of fish that were caught and released) from 1981 to 2011 averaged about 2,000 mt per year and recreational landings for the rod-and-reel fishery from 2012 were 1,842 mt, comprising about 48% of the recreational harvest limits. Recreational landings have averaged 32% since 1981 of the commercial and recreational landings total. Total commercial and recreational landings for 2012 were 8,964 mt with total commercial and recreational discards for 2012 at 11,477 mt. (Linton and Terceiro 2013).&#160;Recreational fishing constitutes a significant proportion of the total harvest of&#160;<em>S. chrysops</em>. From 1977 to 1985, an average of 24% (ranging from 17% to 33%) of the harvest of&#160;&#160;<em>S. chrysops</em>&#160;along the East Coast was taken by anglers (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries accessed 2009).<br/><br/>Commercial discards have been estimated to average 35% to 40% of the total commercial catch since the implementation of the Gear Restricted Areas in 2000.

1286872,170170,Chrysoblephus laticeps,Near Threatened,,2014,2009-12-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps </em>is a reef-dwelling, commercially important sparid with its core distribution along the South African coast, extending from False Bay to the Kei River. This species is considered severely overexploited throughout its range with a stock assessment in 2000 considering the stocks to be collapsed. However, it has been documented to occur at high densities in several MPAs, most notably in the Tsitsikamma National Park and the Goukamma MPA. This species exhibits life history attributes that typically confer higher vulnerability to extrinsic threats (e.g., sedentary and philopatric nature, slow growth, late maturation, longevity, and protogynous hermaphrotism). Though there have been considerable declines in population sizes throughout its range, conservation measures in places such as no-take MPAs have proven effective in the recovery of this species given its residency and small home range. Indeed, some studies have shown that even small MPAs (six km<sup>2</sup>) can offer effective protection for resident species such as the Roman Seabream. Despite an overall decline in total commercial line-fishery catch, <em>C. laticeps </em>CPUE has remained relatively stable between 1985-2007. In addition, CPUE has been stable in the centre of the Tsitsikamma MPA between 2006-2011, in the vicinity of the Goukamma MPA, CPUE increased after MPA implementation in 1990 and doubled the pre-reserve rate after 10 years. Furthermore, drastic nation-wide cuts in commercial effort have been implemented since 2003 to rebuild depleted line-fish stocks. Roman is a highly-valued species with inherent attributes that predispose it to higher extinction risk. Although no-take MPAs in the Eastern and Western Cape have been shown to be extremely effective in protecting this species, some illegal fishing still occurs within these protected areas which could significantly impact their function, specifically the Goukamma MPA.<em> </em>The Goukamma MPA was established in order to protect important offshore reef habitats used by commercially important sparids, such as<em> C. laticeps</em>, and protects a spawning population of this species. <em>Chrysoblephus laticeps </em>displays significantly lower abundance and size at exploited sites when compared to protected areas in its range and since this species exhibits a high degree of residency, post recruit ‘spill-over’ is quite limited. Due to this, the non-compliance in no-take MPAs poses a major threat. This species is conservation dependent as a result of its high degree of residency and habitat specificity. It is therefore listed as Near Threatened given its reliance on the effectiveness of MPAs and management measures in its range. In the absence or non-compliance of these conservation measures, or the failure of these actions to sustain and protect the species, <em>C. laticeps </em>may qualify for listing for one of the threatened categories in five years. We highly recommend that a rigorous stock assessment take place to confirm the effects of rebuilding and conservation effort on this species. If stocks outside MPAs show signs of recovery, this species may warrant listing as Least Concern although the present evidence suggests that it is currently conservation dependent.","<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em>&#160;adults inhabit deep, high-profile, inshore and offshore reefs to 100 m&#160;(Buxton and Smale 1984, Buxton 1987, Götz 2005, Götz<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2008b)&#160;while juveniles use shallow subtidal reefs to 30 m as nursery areas (Penrith 1972a, Buxton and Smale 1984, Buxton 1987, Beckley and Buxton 1989). This species&#160;is a benthic carnivore that feeds on a wide variety of reef associated invertebrates. Adults primarily prey on echinoderms and cephalopods as well as some crustaceans and&#160;polychaetes&#160;while the diet of juveniles mainly consists of polychaetes and some small-bodied decapods and mysids (Buxton 1984, Buxton 1987). Adults are mainly resident within small home ranges of &lt;100 m linear extent, but a few individuals (~9%) travel distances over two magnitudes larger than the home range. These movements are rapid, inconsistent in direction and independent of sex, size, and fish density (Kerwath <em>et al.</em> 2007a, 2007b).&#160;<br/><br/>This species is the only abundant reef-dependent teleost in this feeding category in False Bay, South Africa (Lecanteur and Griffiths 2003). Extensive tagging results have shown that <em>C. laticeps </em>is an extremely resident species and has a small home range (Buxton and Allen 1989, Buxton and Smale 1989, Kerwath <em>et al.</em> 2007a, 2007b). <em>Chrysopblephus laticeps</em>&#160;is a weak swimmer and becomes hydrodynamically poorer as it increases in size (Penrith 1972a).&#160;<br/><br/>The maximum length recorded for&#160;<em>C. laticeps&#160;</em>is&#160;51.2 cm FL (Buxton 1987), the maximum weight is 4.57 kg (SAUFF 2012) and the maximum age is 19 years (male) (Götz 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong>&#160;<br/><br/><em>Chrysoblephus laticeps&#160;</em>a protogynous hermaphrodite and change of sex occurs between seven and nine years of age and 27 cm to 30 cm length, with all individuals over 33 cm being functional males (Penrith 1972a,&#160;Buxton 1992,&#160;van der Elst 1993,&#160;Teske&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Götz <em>et al. </em>2013). After sex change takes place, the behaviour of this species also changes. As females, <em>C. laticeps </em>participates in social open-reef behaviours but becomes solitary, cave dwelling, and territorial as a male (van der Elst 1993).&#160;Males occupy territories and will mate with several females (Buxton 1989, Buxton 1990).&#160;<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em>&#160;is a pair and broadcast spawner, releasing its gametes above the substratum after an elaborate court ship routine (Buxton 1990, Kerwath <em>et al</em>&#160;2013a). <em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em>&#160;spawns throughout its range and lays pelagic eggs. Larvae are passively transported and post-flexion larvae settle after ~17 days (Teske<em> et al.</em> 2010).&#160;<br/><p>The spawning season extends from October to January in the Eastern Cape (Buxton 1990) and spawning has been observed between November and February in the Goukamma area, Western Cape (Götz 2005).</p>The age at 50% maturity is 2.5 years for females from the Eastern Cape (Buxton 1993) and 3.5 years for females from the Goukamma area in the Western Cape (Götz 2005). The length at&#160;50% maturity occurs between 17.2 cm FL and 18.0 cm FL for females from the Eastern Cape and approximately 18.4 cm FL for females from the Western Cape (Götz<em>&#160;</em>2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>C. laticeps</em> is estimated to be eight years, using the following equation for a protogynous fish species: Generation length =SR* (Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)+(Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)","<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps&#160;</em>is currently considered to be overexploited (Griffiths 2000) and although MPAs have provided protection for this species, some illegal fishing still occurs within them (Götz<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008b).&#160;<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em>&#160;is&#160;vulnerable to overexploitation due to life history attributes including its sedentary and philopatric nature, slow growth, late maturation, longevity, and hermaphrotism (Buxton and Allen 1989, Buxton 1993, Kerwath&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007a, 2007b). Sequential hermaphroditic species are subject to dramatic life history and demographic changes as a result of exploitation (Mariani <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). <em>Chrysoblephus</em><em>&#160;laticeps</em>&#160;is able to maintain skewed sex ratios by shifting its size/age at sex-change in areas of low to moderate exploitation; however, this is likely to result in the decrease of overall individual size (Linde and Palmer 2008) which would prove detrimental to fisheries as a decrease in product value would result (Mariani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Areas of severe exploitation may not be able to maintain a balanced sex ratio which can result in gamete limitation, causing detrimental impacts to the reproductive output and genetic variation of this species (Chopelet <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Mariani <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Buxton 1987).&#160;Major threats to <em>C. laticeps&#160;</em> include localized overexploitation by recreational and commercial linefishers, particularly in areas in close proximity to major metropolitan areas (Griffiths 2000).&#160;A spawning biomass per recruit analysis of the male population of&#160;<em>C. laticeps</em>&#160;in the Goukamma&#160;MPA&#160;revealed the vulnerability of males to overexploitation, even at a reduced age-at-sex-change due to fishing, resulting in a high risk of recruitment failure for the population (Götz 2005). This species is susceptible to illegal-fishing within the boundaries of the no-take MPA which could severely compromise the function of the protected area (Götz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The removal of large sparid fishes can change the community structure, and thus reduce both primary and secondary production in a temperate-reef ecosystem (Babcock <em>et al.</em> 1999) and can reduce the links of reef ecosystems with the pelagic food web. Virtually all South African warm-temperate, bottom-dwelling, subtidal linefish species have been overexploited, which can result in the loss of productivity, commensurate socio-economic loss and a high risk of commercial extinction, with harmful impacts to trophic flow and biodiversity being likely (Griffiths 2000).&#160;<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps </em>is an extremely resident species that relies on reef habitats of limited extent, which exacerbates its vulnerability.","The<em> C. laticeps</em> population off South Africa is considered to be over-exploited with spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) ~31% in 1986 in an exploited population off Port Elizabeth (Buxton 1992, 1993). The population has been depleted to varying degrees throughout its range with minimum of about 5% of historical abundance in many areas (Griffiths 2000). Stocks &lt;25% of their pristine level are indicative severe of stock depletion in long lived species with a high risk of collapse (Clark 1991, Mace and Sissenwine 1993, Thompson 1993, Mace 1994).&#160;The mean catch per boat per year of&#160;<em>C. laticeps</em>&#160;in the Southwestern Cape increased from 425 kg (1897-1906) to 560 kg (1927-1931) but subsequently declined to 71 kg for the period 1986 to 1998 indicating a decline in CPUE to 12.65% of the highest recorded catch rates. Similarly in the Southern Cape, mean catch per boat per year increased from 132 kg (1897-1906) to 229 kg (1927-1931) but then declined dramatically to 40 kg in the period 1986 to 1998&#160;&#160;indicating a decline in CPUE to 17.44%. In the Southeastern Cape, the mean catch per boat per year decreased from 860 kg (1897-1906) to 558 kg (1927-1931) and continued to decrease to 40 kg (1986-1998) with a decline in CPUE to 4.65% (Griffiths 2000). Although there has been a continued decline in total commercial catches from 1985–2007, CPUE has remained relatively stable over this period (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data).<em><br/><br/>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em>&#160;is thus considered to be severely overexploited throughout its range (Griffiths 2000) but it still occurs at high densities in several MPAs, most notably in the Tsitsikamma National Park and&#160;Goukamma MPA (Buxton 1987, Buxton and Smale 1989, Götz 2005, Götz <em>et al.</em> 2008b, Kerwath <em>et al.</em> 2013a).&#160;This species was found at higher densities within the protected part of the Goukamma MPA, as defined by Götz (2005), with a CPUE of 4.3 fish/angler/hour and an underwater visual census (UVC) of 2.2 fish/point-count compared to that of exploited areas with a CPUE of 3.4 fish/angler/hour and UVC of 1.8 fish/point-count. The condition factor of this species in the protected area, however, was significantly lower than that of the individuals in exploited areas and it is suspected to be due to greater intra-specific competition within the MPA (Götz 2005).<br/><br/>After the establishment of the Goukamma MPA in 1990, the CPUE adjacent to the MPA (within 30 km of the MPA boundary) improved, doubling the pre-reserve rate after 10 years (Kerwath <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013a). Diving and angling surveys in several MPAs, including Goukamma, indicate that this species responds well to spatial protection, and abundance, size-structure, sex-ratio, and age-at-sex-change have recovered inside reserves of various sizes (Buxton 1989, 1993; Götz 2005; Kerwath <em>et al. </em>2013a).&#160;<br/><br/>Sex ratios are skewed towards females in exploited areas compared to populations in protected areas (Buxton 1993) as a result of the protogynous hermaphroditism exhibited by <em>C. laticeps</em>. Exploited populations of <em>C. laticeps</em> have a lower age-at-maturity and age-at sex-change compared to protected populations inside MPAs (Buxton 1993, Götz 2005). However, in areas of low to moderate fishing pressure an even sex ratio can be maintained through a shift in size/age-at sex-change (Götz&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008a). In terms of genetics,&#160;<em>C. laticeps</em>&#160;occurs in a single, well-mixed population (Teske <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>Fishing mortality reported from an exploited area off Port Elizabeth in the Southeastern Cape was estimated at 0.29 per year (M=0.11 per year<sup></sup>) while in the Tsitsikamma MPA over the same period (1980-86) the fishing mortality was reported to be 0.047 per year (M=0.19 per year) (Buxton 1992). A more recent per-recruit stock assessment in the exploited area adjacent to the Goukamma MPA found that the roman population was optimally exploited at 52% of its pristine spawner biomass (Götz 2005) but fishing pressure near metropolitan areas is probably considerably higher than this (Buxton 1992).<br/><br/>Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African linefishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term fisheries rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).",Stable,"<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps </em>is endemic to southern Africa and is distributed from Namibia to Port St. John's, Eastern Cape, South Africa to 100 m depth; however, its occurrence is very rare on the west coast. The core distribution extends from False Bay in the west to the Kei River in the southeast (Griffiths and Wilke 2002). Records from southern Madagascar and Mauritius are doubtful (Fischer and Bianchi 1984, Smith and Heemstra 1991, Buxton 1987, van der Elst 1993, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).<br/><br/> 		 	 	 		 			 				 					<p><br/></p>","<em>Chrysoblephus laticeps </em>is important to commercial and recreational ski-boat fisheries in the Eastern and Western Capes (Crawford and Crous 1982, Smale and Buxton 1985, Hecht and Tilney 1989). Recreational fishers usually have up to five crew members and operate from relatively small, outboard powered ski-boats while commercial fishers operate from both ski- and line-boats. Commercial line-boats are large harbour-based vessels capable of remaining at sea for more than a week (Buxton 1992). This species is also frequently speared by divers (Mann <em>et al.</em> 1997) and is occasionally taken by shore anglers fishing in deep water (Brouwer 1997, Götz <em>et al</em>. 2008b).",Marine,"The daily bag limit for the <em>C. laticeps</em> fishery is two fish, per person per day for recreational fishers and is unlimited for commercial fishers. The minimum size limit for <em>C. laticeps</em> is 30 cm TL, applying to all sectors of the fisheries. Daily bag limit and minimum landing size regulations may have limited effectiveness when fish are caught in deep water due to the effects of barotrauma (Kerwath<em> et al.</em> 2013b)&#160;<br/><br/><em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em> occurs in several no-take MPAs on the South African coast including Table Mountain (A. Bernard, South African Environmental Observation Network in prep.), De Hoop (Griffiths and Wilke 2002), Goukamma (Götz 2005; Götz <em>et al.</em> 2008b, 2013), Tsitsikamma (Buxton 1987, 1993, Götz<em> et al. </em>2008b), Bird Island (Chalmers 2011), and Stilbaai MPAs (L. de Vos, UCT unpublished data). The abundance of <em>C. laticeps</em> females in the Goukamma MPA is projected to recover to 100% and male abundance to 80% of pre-exploitation values five years after exploitation has ceased (Kerwath <em>et al.</em> 2013a). The Goukamma MPA was established in order to protect to offshore reef habitat used by commercial important sparid species (WWF 2014). This MPA provides protection to a spawning population of <em>C. laticeps </em>with near pristine population parameters&#160;(Götz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It has been suggested that the seaward boundary of the Goukamma MPA be altered to coincide with a latitudinal line which may increase the function of the reserve as a harvest refuge for resident reef fishes such as roman, facilitate voluntary compliance and monitoring and prosecution of illegal fishing without a significant negative impact on the commercial linefishing fleet in the area (Götz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><em>Chrysoblephus laticeps</em> has sustained fishing pressure better than many other South African endemic sparid fishes with relatively stable CPUEs (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data). This may be due to the small size at maturity (~18 cm FL) compared to the minimum legal size (27.2 cm FL) which allows individuals to reproduce at least once before they are introduced to the fishery (Götz and Kerwath 2011). Furthermore, because of its small home range (Kerwath <em>et al.</em> 2007a, 2007b), this species can be effectively protected within small to medium size MPAs (Götz <em>et al.</em> 2008a). It is suggested that if compliance issues are adequately addressed, current size and bag limits retained, and the expansion of the MPA network in South Africa is continued, the restoration of <em>C. laticeps</em> should prove successful (Götz and Kerwath 2011,&#160;Götz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","",,false,false,Global

The total commercial catch for this species has declined by ~70% from 1987-2007, nearing the threshold for a threatened category.

Limited tagging data indicates that <em>C. anglicus</em>&#160;is a highly resident species (ORI Tagging Project unpublished data). The maximum recorded age for this species is 17 years (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), with a maximum length of 80 cm TL (van der Elst 1993), and a maximum weight of 7 kg (South African Deep Sea Angling Association 2012).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Chrysoblephus anglicus</em>&#160;is believed to be a protogynous hermaphrodite but this has yet to be confirmed (Garratt <em>et al. </em>1994, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).

Increased targeting of this species has resulted in high fishing mortality which has led to the ""collapse"" of the stock as defined by the South African Linefish Managment Protocol (&lt;25% SBPR) (Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1999).","<p>The&#160;<em>C. anglicus</em>&#160;stock is considered to be collapsed with a spawning biomass per recruit estimated at ~17% (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).

As a proportion of the total commercial KwaZulu-Natal line fish catch, this species increased from 1.5% for the period 1940 to 1941 to 6% for 1985 to 1992 (Garratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Mean size decreased slightly from 35 cm FL (1979–1981) to 34.3 cm FL (1990-92) (Garratt <em>et al</em>. 1994) but increased back to 35 cm FL in 2003 (Mann <em>et al</em>. 2005).

The total commercial catch for this species has declined from a peak of about 70 tonnes in 1987 to an average of about 20 tonnes from 2004–2007. Using targeted effort data, there was no significant upward or downward trend in abundance over a 25 year period since 1985.</p><p>Male:Female sex ratio recorded on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast in 2003 (1:25, Mann <em>et al</em>. 2005) had changed from 1:14 recorded by Garratt <em>et al</em>.

Differences in M:F sex ratios observed along the KwaZulu-Natal coast suggest that more male fish occur in the northern areas (e.g. 1:3.7 north of Richards Bay) compared to 1:14 south of Ramsgate (Garratt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Similarly, the mean size of fish sampled at Richards Bay (39.1 cm FL) were significantly larger than those sampled on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast (35 cm FL) (Mann&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Male: Female sex ratio in St Lucia Marine Reserve was reported to be 1:3.7 while it was 1:4.0 on KwaZulu-Natal south coast (Fennessy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000). This species is an unconfirmed protogynous hermaphrodite with an exploited sex ratio strongly skewed in favour of females (Garratt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994, Mann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;</p><p>Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African line fishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term fisheries rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Chrysoblephus&#160;anglicus</em> is endemic to the area between the mouth of the Limpopo River, in southern Mozambique, and Algoa Bay in South Africa (Bauchot and Smith 1984, Smith and Heemstra 1986, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004) with the main stock assumed to occur between southern Mozambique and the former Transkei (van der Elst and Adkin 1991).

This species is also taken by competitive spearfishers (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). <em>Chrysoblephus anglicus&#160;</em>contributes approximately 6% of the total commercial linefish catch in KwaZulu-Natal and a total catch of 49.7 tonnes was reported in 1992 (Garratt <em>et al.</em> 1994). <em>Chrysoblephus anglicus</em> also comprises approximately 4.7% of the total commercial catch in southern Mozambique taken by lineboats operating out of Maputo (van der Elst <em>et al.</em> 1994). Historic data show that while CPUE and catch composition has increased slightly, this is thought to be due to a change in targeting (Garratt<em> et al.</em> 1994). The sex ratio has been heavily skewed towards females due to the removal of larger male fish, especially on the lower KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Based on this information and the stock assessment undertaken by Mann <em>et al.</em> (2005), a precautionary approach has been taken with regard to the management of this potentially vulnerable species.",Marine,"The first conservation actions for this species were implemented in South African legislation in 1984 and included a daily bag limit of five fish per person per day (regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 58 of 1973).

Based on spawning biomass per recruit model predictions, effective implementation of these later regulations should result in stock rebuilding&#160;(Mann<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005). In addition to traditional fisheries management, a number of large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established along the South African coast and are likely to provide important protection for the resident populations of this species (B.

One of the most recent MPAs to be established was the Pondoland MPA between Port Edward and Port St Johns and extending out to the 1,000 m depth contour (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2006) primarily for the protection of overexploited endemic linefish species found in the area including <em>C. anglicus </em>(Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).

The AOO for this species is 3,086 km<sup>2</sup>.","<em>Lithognathus aureti</em>&#160;is an important species in the recreational fishery in Namibia (Kirchner <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000), with the&#160;northern stock primarily exploited by recreational shore anglers in the West Coast Recreational area (260 km) and in Torra Bay and Terrace Bay in the Skeleton Coast Park (65 km), together constituting one fifth of Namibia’s 1,500 km-long coastline. The southern stock is occasionally targeted by commercial line-boats when kob (<em>Argyrosomus inodorus</em>) is scarce (Holtzhausen and Mann 2000, Mann and Potts 2013).&#160;It is estimated that the Namibian recreational line-fishery contributes $35 million per annum to the GDP of the country, of which approximately $4.5 million could be attributed to the&#160;<em>L. aureti</em> resource (Holtzhausen and Mann 2000). <em>Lithognathus aureti </em>is only taken as an incidental catch by recreational ski-boat anglers (Mann and Potts 2013).&#160;This species is commonly fished between October and March (Bianchi <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The SSB for the northern subpopulation was estimated at 772 tonnes (range 538–1,121) and MSY at 134 tonnes (range 109–173) which was equalled in the 1995/1996 season and was almost double the amount harvested in the 1998/1999 season. Commercial line-boat catches of both stocks of <em>L. aureti</em> have been recorded since 1973 (35 tonnes landed) and reached a peak in 1980 (407 tonnes landed), followed by a downward trend with a zero catch in 1993. The use of set nets was banned in 1992 to protect the species (Holtzhausen 2000). After not harvesting the southern subpopulation for 11 years, 67 tonnes and 97 tonnes were harvested in 1997 and 1999, respectively, with 82% of these catches consisting of females of ten years and older (Holtzhausen and Mann 2000).",Marine,"In South Africa,&#160;<em>Lithognathus aureti</em>&#160;is prohibited in the commercial line-fishery (a ""no sale"" species), and there is a daily bag limit of one fish per person per day for recreational and subsistence fishers as well as a minimum landing size of 60 cm TL (Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 2012). In Namibia, each angler may only have ten teleost fish, including kob, west coast steenbras, blacktail, and galjoen and no more than two individual fish longer than 65 cm TL may be kept. Each person may transport three times the daily bag limit but is limited to not more than ten of each species, and all fish must be whole. Of the ten <em>L. aureti</em>&#160;allowed, six may be over 65 cm TL .

Sandwich Bay area and the recently proclaimed MPA in southern Namibia provide some protection for this species. Although four-fifths of the coastline is closed to recreational angling (i.e., diamond mining areas), line-boats may operate along the entire 1,500 km of coastline. In Namibia, for all angling species, there is a limit of one rod per angler with a maximum of two hooks, the use of polychaete worms as bait is prohibited, a recreational angler may not sell his catch, and there is a ban on the use of set-nets by line-boats. No new rights of exploitation for line-boats have been granted since 1992 (Holtzhausen and Mann 2000).<br/><br/>The northern <em>L. aureti</em> resource in Namibia is small, with an estimated MSY of <em>c. </em>134 tonnes per year (Holtzhausen and Kirchner 2001a), and thus should be managed wisely.

Adults of this species feed on gastropods, echinoids, chlorophytes, crustaceans, and polychaetes, while juveniles feed on gastropods, pelecypods, solitary ascidians, pagurids and amphineurans (Buxton and Clarke 1991). The maximum age recorded for <em>S. durbanensis</em>&#160;is 31 years, the maximum length recorded is 120 cm TL (van der Elst 1988, Buxton and Clark 1991), and the maximum weight is 22.2 kg (South African Underwater Fishing Federation 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Sparodon durbanensis</em> is a late gonochorist (sensu rudimentary hermaphrodite) that spawns from August to January and forms spawning aggregations.

Stock assessments based on data from 1986 to 2001 indicate that the stock was overfished, however, more recent stock assessments suggest some recovery since the reduction in commercial effort in 2003. Due to the considerable reduction in total effort, the 2014 stock assessment using an age-structured production model for the Western Cape and Eastern Cape indicate that stocks are nearing B<sub>MSY</sub>.&#160;There are no discernible trends in mean size and sex ratio for this species.

The lack of sexual dimorphism in this species and GSI comparisons of males and females suggest that this species exhibits group spawning behaviour (Brouwer and Griffiths 2005). Fecundity, egg size, spawning frequency, and spawning duration were found to be positively correlated to increased body size (Brouwer and Griffiths 2005).

Inshore trawl CPUE for <em>A. argyrozona&#160;</em>for the period 1985 to 1994 was 2.8% and 2.4% of the historical peaks from the period 1944 to 1954 for the Southeastern Cape and the Southern Cape, respectively. Fishery independent data from surveys conducted from 1931 to 1933 and 1987 to 1993 indicate that CPUE for&#160;<em>A. argyrozona</em>&#160;declined by 75% between the two periods (Griffiths 2000).

However, CPUE has improved substantially as a result of the commercial effort reduction with the long-term rights allocation in 2006 and the removal of larger deck boats from the fishery (Winker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, 2013).

1300216,170244,Pagellus bogaraveo,Near Threatened,,2014,2009-08-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<strong>Global</strong><em><em><br/></em><em><br/><br/></em></em><em>Pagellus bogaraveo</em> is relatively widespread from Norway to Saharan Africa including Madeira and Canary Islands. The Blackspot Seabream has a wide depth distribution and is common in parts of its range (Mediterranean Sea). Its fisheries are semi-industrial and artisanal, and it is also taken as a sport fish. It is also regularly landed as bycatch. The average global capture from 1950-2011 of the Blackspot Seabream reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Northeast Atlantic contributed the highest percentage of global landings, comprising 99% of global production over 61 years. The Northeast Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Spain (contributing 83% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). There is a general decreasing trend in global landings for <em>P. bogaraveo</em> reported from 1950-2011. The catches reported from the West African coast are comparatively small and could be attributed to its occurrence here in the southern limit of the geographical range of this species, and its occurrence in deep waters. There have been substantial declines in total catch and CPUE in the Strait of Gibraltar, Bay of Biscay, Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea which prompted management measures including: closed seasons, minimum size limits, gear restrictions, and an European Union wide Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Landings from the Strait of Gibraltar decreased by ~67% in only four years has raised concerns about the fishery and prompted monitoring. This species occurs in a number of marine protected areas in parts of its range. However, because of its particular biology (large size, late maturing, long-lived, protandric hermaphrodite) the Blackspot Sea Bream is especially sensitive to overfishing. The historical evidence of over-exploitation and population collapse in at least one major fishery (the Bay of Biscay) as well as indications of over-exploitation in other parts of its range are a cause for concern in this species. Although the declines are limited in scope and scale, we infer that population declines approaching 30% in three genration lengths (=33 years) have occured. It is therefore listed here as Near Threatened under A2bd. It is recommended that fisheries for this species be closely monitored and steps be taken to reduce the fishing effort in order to decrease the fishing mortality where this is indicated.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Europe&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><br/>In Europe, this species has sustained substantial population declines, and is currently under a fishery management plan. Current stock assessments indicate that though uncertainties lie in these estimates, the recent increasing trend in landings in the fishery may not be sustainable and it is recommended that fishing mortality rates be reduced until reliable estimates show sustainability of the fishery. It is listed as Near Threatened under A2bd","<em>Pagellus bogaraveo</em> is a benthopelagic fish that  occurs mostly on the continental shelf break and slope, on various types  of bottom (rock, sand, mud),&#160;on seamounts&#160;(Afonso&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012)&#160;and around islands, at depths of up to 800 m (Spedicato<em> et al. </em>2002, Menezes <em>et al.</em>  2006). It has been observed at a depth of 787 m at Bari Canyon (Southern Adriatic Sea) in groups of up to 40 individuals (D`Onghia <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;The young are found nearer to the shore, the adults on the continental  slope, especially over muddy bottoms. In the eastern Ionian Sea, the species inhabits the shallow waters of the shelf (&lt;170 m depth) as juveniles up to a certain size (&lt;180 mm total length, LT), moving to deeper waters of the slope (mainly 400–500 m depth) as adults (Mytilineou<em> et al</em>. 2013). This species is omnivorous, with a predominantly  carnivorous diet (crustaceans, molluscs, worms, small fish) (Morato <em>et al.</em>  2001). Blackspot Sea Bream grow to at least 70 cm standard length  (about 80 cm (TL); Bauchot and Hureau 1986) and up to four kg  (Frimodt 1995). In the Bay of Biscay, the biggest reported fish in the  1960s were 68 and 70 cm total length. Their scales, which were difficult  to read, could have included 25–30 annual&#160;growth increments (Gueguen  1969). It is a protandric hermaphrodite, most individuals being first  functional males and&#160;then develop into functional females, at 20-30 cm  length. A fraction of the population never changes sex and is referred  to as gonochoric (Lorance 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In fish farming conditions, up to 40%  of individuals are gonochoric females (Micale<em> et al.&#160;</em>2002), but  the proportion of gonochoric females seems to be much lower in the wild  (Krug 1989). In the wild, the proportion of females per size class and  their state of maturity over time may depend on population abundance,  with more females at lower abundances (Krug 1998). As a result, the  proportion of females may increase as a result of fishing (ICES 1996).  In captivity, male Blackspot Sea Bream first mature at a size of 28 cm  total length and age three; both gonochoric and secondary females first  spawn at 29.5 cm total length and age four (Micale <em>et al. </em>2002).  In the wild, the smallest observed mature female was 30 cm long and five to eight  years old (Sanchez 1983, Krug 1998). In the Strait of Gibraltar, Gil and  Sobrino (2001) estimated the mean size at maturation of females as 35.7  cm total length. Sexual maturity occurs at four to five years (22-25 cm) in the Strait of Gibraltar. The  spawning period (from GSI estimation) was during the first quarter of  the year, and lengths at maturity were estimated for males and females  to be 30.14 and 35.72 cm, respectively (Gil and Sobrino 2001).&#160;<br/><br/>This species forms  spawning aggregations; spawning occurs from January to June when the  adults move towards the coast up to the edge of the continental shelf.  &#160;In captivity, spawning occurred in March-April, at a size of 28.0 cm  and an age of three years in males and at 29.5 cm and four years in  females (Micale<em>&#160;et al. </em>2002). Undifferentiated gonads were  found in fish smaller than 22.0&#160;cm. Adult fish showed four gonadal  differentiations: ovotestes with functional testis and quiescent ovary  (Mf), ovotestes with functional ovary and regressed testis (mF),  ovotestes with both ovary and testis at a resting stage (mf), and  ovaries with no male tissue (F). The overall incidence of gonochoric  females F was 41%. Functional males Mf were more frequent in age classes one plus and two plus, whereas functional females mF predominated in the three plus age  class, above 25.0&#160;cm TL (Micale&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002).&#160;In the  Azores&#160;over the ten year period, there have been increases in fecundity  and decreases in length of first maturity in females, apparently related  to changes in growth, the fish maturing at an earlier age. In contrast  first maturity in males was attained at a greater length than  previously, though the age was the same. The sexual transition was also  altered, with an increasing proportion of intersexual forms, contrasted  with an obvious decrease in males (Krug 1998).<br/><br/>In the Ionian Sea, the  allometric coefficient of the length-weight relationship is 2.9339. The  von Bertalanffy growth parameters based on data from otoliths are&#160;L<sub>∞</sub>&#160;= 49.2 cm, k = 0.106, t<sub>o</sub> =-1.81 for males, and&#160;L<sub>∞</sub>= 49.5 cm, k = 0.100, t<sub>o</sub> =-2.29 for females; whereas based on scale reading these were&#160;L<sub>∞</sub>&#160;= 46.1 cm, k = 0.082, t<sub>o</sub> =-3.40 for males, and&#160;L<sub>∞</sub>&#160;= 52.8 cm, k = 0.059, t<sub>o</sub> =-4.73 for females (Chilari <em>et al.</em> 2006).

There is historical evidence of overexploitation and population  collapse in at least one major fishery, in the Bay of Biscay (Lorance  2011). This species is heavily exploited and is closely associated with atmospheric oscillations and thus may be impacted by global climate change (Báez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","There is evidence of&#160;the existence of three Blackspot Seabream stocks in the northeast Atlantic: one in the Azores region (ICES Area X), one in continental Portuguese shelf/slope waters (ICES Area IXa), and one in the waters around Madeira (sub-area 1.2 of FAO 34, central-eastern Atlantic) (Hermida&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In the Mediterranean Sea it is locally abundant in some places in the Aegean Sea (K. Bizsel and B. Yokes pers. comm.), common along the Algerian coast (H. Kara pers. comm.) and common in southwestern France (P. Francour pers. comm.).&#160;<em>Pagellus bogaraveo</em>&#160;is common outside sea-cage forms in the Turkish Aegean Sea feeding on the feed (pellets) (Akyol and Ertosluk 2010), and accounted for 10.9% of the total weight of one fish farm from 2004-2008.&#160;<br/><br/>The average global capture from 1950-2011 of the Blackspot Seabream reported to the&#160;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that the Northeast Atlantic contributed the highest&#160;percentage of global landings, comprising 99% of global production over 61 years, the rest coming from the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Central Atlantic.&#160;Portugal and Spain are the main producing countries (Basurco&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The Northeast Atlantic landings are mainly driven by catches reported from Spain (contributing 83% of the landings in the FAO fishing region). The total global capture reported from all FAO fishing areas was 381,648 mt (1950-2011). There is a general decreasing trend in global landings for&#160;<em>P. bogaraveo&#160;</em>reported from 1950-2011. FAO annual catch data for this species show a steady increase from around 50 to 140 mt to 2005.&#160;This increase is likely to be due to improved recording for this species.&#160;Catch fluctuated from 1950 and reached a peak in 1974 at 16,696 metric tons, landings decreased subsequently but reach another peak in 1977 at 12,500 mt. Landings have thus declined since the 1970s.&#160;The West African coast represents the southern limit of the geographical range of this species. This, together with its occurrence in deep waters, explains why the catches from the area are comparatively small<strong></strong>&#160;(Carpenter FAO ECA Guide in press).<br/><br/>The Blackspot Seabream fishery off the Strait of Gibraltar indicate that current exploitation levels have led to a decrease in landings and mean length of fishes landed since 2010, similar to the trends reported from the mid-1990s. The landings from 2005 through 2009 increased every year, exceeding the fishery's Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (Gil Herrera 2012). The fishery in the Strait of Gibraltar is carried out over bottoms from 350 to 700 m depth. The fishery in the area began in the early 1980s. The number of boats operating in the fishery increased from 25 boats in 1983 to more than 100 boats in the early 1990s, and slightly decreased to 94 authorized fishing boats in 2011, as a consequence of the regulations established in late 2009 by the Regional Government's (Junta de Andalucia) recovery plan for the Blackspot Seabream in the Strait of Gibraltar. The fishery is almost a single species fishery in which <em>P. bogaraveo</em> represents 74% of the total landings in weight and 91% in value (more than EUR 5 million in 2010). Landings from this fishery represents almost 70% of the total species landings in ICES Subarea IX (ICES 2012). The landings increased to about 854 tonnes in 1994, but declined rapidly to 282 tonnes in 1998; the decrease in landings rose some serious concerns prompted monitoring from the Instituto Espanol de Oceanografica (IEO) (Burgos <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>From the 1950s to the 1970s, Blackspot Seabream was exploited mainly by French and Spanish bottom offshore trawlers, by artisanal pelagic trawlers in the eastern Bay of Biscay (ICES Divisions VIIIa,b), and by Spanish longliners in the Cantabrian Sea (ICES Division VIIIc), with smaller contributions from other fisheries (Sanchez 1983, Dardignac 1988). The stock in the Bay of Biscay collapsed during the period 1975–1985, and it has not been of significant fishery interest since. Since the 1980s, it has been mainly a bycatch in France, and only a few small-scale handliners have been targeting the species (Lorance 2011). In the late 1960s, trawlers from La Rochelle, the main French port for landings of Blackspot Sea Bream throughout the twentieth century, redirected more effort towards this species as a result of the declining catch rates for hake (Guichet<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1971). Guichet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1971) noted no sign of overexploitation and reported a large proportion of individuals aged 10 and older in the catch. Seven years later, a severe drop in landings was reported (Njock 1978), and from the mid-1980s, it was clear that the stock had collapsed (Dardignac 1988). Based on FAO landings data for the Northeast Atlantic for 1972–2002, Blackspot Sea Bream was classified as a depleted species, and it is one of the few species whose landings had already declined to low levels by the early 1980s (Caddy and Surette 2005).<br/><br/>FAO capture production figures in 2012 were: Croatia two tonnes; Cyprus two tonnes; Portugal 740 tonnes; France 90 tonnes; Netherlands nine tonnes; Spain 236 tonnes; and United Kingdom three tonnes.<br/><br/>The  Blackspot Seabream has traditionally been the main target species of  the bottom longline fishery in the Azores, but in recent years several  other species have increased in economic importance, including the  Axillary Sea Bream, <em>P. acarne</em> (Morato <em>et al.  </em>2001). From 1981 to 1994 Blackspot Sea Bream represented 26% of total  landings and 38% of total income of the demersal fisheries in the  Azores. During this period, landings of this species increased by about  240% while an overall decrease in relative abundance was observed in the  Azores (Menezes and Silva 1999).<br/><br/>The fishery of Blackspot Seabream in Greek waters since the beginning of the 1980s were carried out mainly by long lines. In recent years, gill nets and trammel nets have been used in the Aegean Sea and Ionian Sea. Catches were extremely high during the early years of exploitation, with subsequent declines. In 1998, field observations in the Ionian Sea showed catch at 46 kg/1,000 m of netting; this decline in catch prompted a decrease in mesh size which lead to a number of negative outcomes: increased discards, lower market prices, higher pressure on the population, and reduction of the spawning stock.&#160;Similar declines in the total catch and the catch per unit of effort has been observed in the Strait of Gibraltar, in the ICES divisions VI, VII, VIII the stock is near to collapse, whereas the Andalucia region (Spain) government since 1999 has adopted a recovery plan for the stock. Generally in the Mediterranean the stock is heavily exploited and the biomass is declining, however, no other regulations are currently imposed on the fishery except the minimum landing size, which is set at 12&#160;cm and applies to all the&#160;<em>Pagellus&#160;</em>species (Chilari <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Populations in the Northeast Atlantic are structured regionally, with populations of&#160;<em>P. bogaraveo</em>&#160;in the Azores genetically distinct from those on the European continental shelf, off Portugal and Madeira. Although, Patarnello&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2007) showed very little or no population structure and no signs of Atlantic-Mediterranean division for this species.&#160;While this structure may be strongly influenced by historical factors (severe environmental effects of the last glacial maxima), current levels of gene flow have been insufficient to homogenize populations. This finding has implications for management of deep-water species at the regional level, in that migration between populations separated by major hydrographic features, such as ocean basins, is limited.&#160;The chance of a rescue effect from migration and dispersal from other populations to compensate for impacts of directed exploitation, in terms of both biomass and genetic variability, will therefore be diminished given this bottleneck (Stockley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).",Decreasing,"<em style=""font-style: italic;"">Pagellus bogaraveo</em><em>&#160;</em>is widely distributed in the eastern Atlantic and is known from southern Norway and around all of the British Isles to Western Sahara, including Madeira the Azores and the Canary Islands. It is common in the western Mediterranean but is rarer east of Sicily, except for parts of the Adriatic, the Aegean and the Sea of Marmara, and absent from the eastern to southeastern Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea (Carpenter FAO ECA Guide in press.). This species occurs to 800 m depth (Bauchot and Hureau 1986).","<em>Pagellus bogaraveo </em>is an important food fish,  marketed fresh and frozen in the Mediterranean region. This species is  caught with trawls, trammel nets and bottom long lines. Its fisheries  are semi-industrial and artisanal, and it is also taken as a sport fish.  The main target species of the bottom longline fishery in the Azores  (Krug 1998, Morato <em>et al.</em> 2001).&#160;In the Azores, juveniles were found to be targeted by three types of fisheries, amounting to cumulative annual catches of <em>c. </em>36 t. Shore angling was the most important fishing method, followed by bait fishing for tuna and the coastal pelagic live-bait fishery (Pinho <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is present regularly in the  markets of France, Spain, Morocco and Italy, but only occasionally in  Sicily, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey, and rarely elsewhere (Fischer <em>et al. </em>1987). This species has been heavily exploited by artisanal fleet home-base in the Gibralter Strait. Fleets of Algeciras and Tarifa fished <em>P. bogaraveo</em>&#160;exclusively using a vertical deep water longline called 'voracera' baited with small sardines. Additionally, artisanal fleets from Conil used a traditional bottom longline in the western part of the Gibraltar Strait&#160; (Báez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;It is characteristic of festivals in some central Spanish regions, has a high price in the Spanish domestic market due to the overexploitation of the fishery, and a high supply concentration in only one first-hand sale market, Tarifa, where landings grew from 1983 to 1994 and from that year onwards, they have declined. On the other hand, prices rose steadily during this time which has caused an increase in imports from Portugal and Morocco (Jimenez-Toribio and Garcia-del-Hoyo 2006).&#160;It is marketed fresh and frozen (its flesh is esteemed) and is also used for  fishmeal and oil (Carpenter FAO ECA Guide in press). It is a potential candidate for  aquaculture in the Mediterranean,&#160;but at present only one commercial  operation produces this fish in Galicia on the Atlantic coast of Spain,  using floating net cages. Commercial production started in 2002 and has  increased from two tonnes to 195 tonnes in 2006 (Basurco&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).",Marine,"In Spain, fisheries regulations include: a closed season from Febraury and March, minimum hook size regulation, maximum number of hooks per line (set to 100), a maximum number of lines (30) and automatic hauling machines (three) per boat, and a minimum fish landig size (33 cm)&#160;(BOE No. 157 of July 2, 1998, Burgos <em>et al. </em>2013). Additionally, a European Union Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was introduced in 2003 as part of council regulation (EC) No. 2340/2002 of 16 December 2002 ﬁxing the ﬁshing opportunities for deep-sea ﬁsh stocks for 2003 and 2004 (Burgos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;In the Azores, fishery managers have enforced several measures to protect juveniles, although evidence indicates that effective interdiction of juvenile catch would provide a long-term increase of 15 and 8% in spawning-stock biomass and catch, respectively, as well as ∼13% increase in the value of landings. Although this measure could improve the protection of a species in an advanced state of overexploitation, results showed that a decrease in fishing effort would still be necessary to achieve sustainability of the stock (Pinho <em>et al</em> 2014).","",,false,false,Global

In Japan, in is found in the Inland Sea of Seto and the western coast of Kyushu. In China, the species occurs in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East China Sea. It is found at depths ranging from one to 30 m. It is found in coastal areas, creeks, and estuaries. <em>Takifugu vermicularis</em>&#160;is a highly-prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Aggregate landings data for several species of valuable <em>Takifugu</em> from Japan show an increase in landings to a peak in the late 1990s/early 2000s, followed by a roughly 75% decline in landings to 2007. The relative contribution of <em>T. vermicularis</em> to these landings, however, is unknown. Additional population data from the Yellow Sea reveal decreases in mean size and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1985 to 2002, which are indications of possible population decline. Possible threats to <em>T. vermicularis</em> include overfishing, habitat modification and possible negative effects of large-scale aquaculture of congeners, which can introduce pathogens to wild populations. Additionally, this species is considered to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of its generally larger size, slow growth rate, late maturation and lower potential rates of population increase. As it is taken in the same fisheries, <em>T.&#160;vermicularis&#160;</em>is likely to benefit from conservation measures in place for <em>T. rubripes</em>.&#160;Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. Available information suggests that this species has undergone population declines in parts of its range, however these are currently unquantifiable. The population of <em>T. vermicularis</em>&#160;is likely conservation dependent, its persistence linked to successful fisheries management. Therefore it is assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><em><br/><br/></em>","<em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is a temperate, demersal species which occurs near shore in semi-enclosed sea areas and and in estuaries (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995). It undergoes seasonal migrations (Matsui <em>et al.</em>1987). It has also been collected from creeks in Inchon and Ansan, Korea (Jeon and Yoo 1995).<br/><br/>The lifespan of<em> T. vermicularis</em> is estimated at five years. Growth of this species, in total length, can be related to the growth of the fifth vertebral centrum. The&#160;annual&#160;mark is formed in June. The calculated total length at time was 132 mm in one year, 194 mm in two years, 241 mm in three years, 274 mm in four years, and 299 mm in five years (Matsui <em>et al. </em>1987).&#160;Naturally occurring hybrids of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. vermicularis </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. xanthopterus </span>have been observed from Ariake Bay, Kyushu, Japan (Masuda<em> et al. </em>1991).<br/><br/>The skin and intestine are highly toxic, and the ovaries and liver are extremely toxic. The flesh and testes are believed to be edible although they are slightly toxic, and sometimes highly toxic (Nakabo 2002). In the ovaries, TTX was recognized in the nucleus, yolk vesicles and yolk granules of oocytes (Mahmud<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2003). This species also bio-accumulates saxitoxin, a paralytic shellfish toxin (Nakamura<em> et al. </em>1984). <br/><br/>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).","<p><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""><span class=""nbApiHighlight""></span></span></p><p><em>Takifugu vermicularis</em> is considered to be particularly  vulnerable to exploitation  because of its generally larger size, slow  growth rate, late maturation  and lower potential rates of population  increase (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  1990, Jin  and Tang 1996, Xu and Jin 2005). Based on data collected from  bottom trawl surveys  in winter in the southern Yellow Sea, <em>T. vermicularis</em> has shown  decreasing mean individual weight and catch-per-unit effort  from&#160;1985 to 2002 (Xu and Jin 2005). The intrinsic vulnerability of this species is 38 (Cheung&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2008).<br/><br/><strong>Fugu fishery<br/></strong>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated. Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. vermicularis</em> are unknown, landings of this species, along with other desirable <em>Takifugu</em> spp. have declined by 75% from 2000 to 2007 (Kawata 2012).</p><p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aquacultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/></p>","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995 and Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

Following sharp decreases in landings of the most highly&#160;desirable&#160;species&#160;beginning&#160;in the mid-1980s, landings of other&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;species steadily increase until reaching a peak in the years 1999 to 2000. A sharp drop in landings of other puffer species, including&#160;<em>T. variomaculatus</em>, occurs from 2000 to 2001 (from ~400,000 to 75,000 tons) and remains below 100,000 lbs until at least 2007.

Aquaculture efforts focus on&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth&#160;among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em><em>&#160;</em>is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999 (Kikuchi 2006). One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality–survival is estimated to be less than 50% - from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).</p><p>Tiger puffer (<em>T. rubripes</em>) was introduced to China from Japan (Lin and &#160;Huang 2007). To meet increasing demand for pufferfish, China began large-scale artificial breeding of pufferfish in the 1990s. An annual output of about 4,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, which was introduced from Japan to China (Lin and Huang 2007) is exported to Japan and South Korea. Additionally, an annual output of about 6,000 tonnes of&#160;<em>T. obscurus</em>&#160;was also produced for export in China.

Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012). Following the ratification of the UN Convention of  the Law of the Sea,  Japan implemented the Total Allowable Effort (TAE) system in Ise Bay and  Mikawa Bay (Hoshino 2010).

It is found in the Yellow, Bohai, and East China Seas. It is a coastal species which is found at depths ranging from 10 to 135 m. This species is dependent on estuaries for spawning. Juveniles mature in estuaries and migrate offshore to spawn.<em> Takifugu rubripes</em> is a highly prized food fish in Japan with a high retail value. Population declines which have been attributed to the use of highly-effective fishing gear have been recorded in parts of its range, however range-wide information is currently not available. Available landing information from Japan indicates landings have declined to about 5% of their historical peak from 1987 to 2004. Stocks in the Seto Inland Sea have failed to recover from historical declines resulting from excessive fishing effort and a decline in anchovy stocks. Due to declining stocks, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005. This plan set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is aquacultured in large quantities in order to meet consumer demand, however wild-caught <em>T. rubripes</em> remain highly valued. Stock enhancement programs using aquacultured<em> T. rubripes</em> are in place, however the efficacy of these programs is unknown and mortality in aquaculture is high due to parasitic diseases, which may become introduced into wild populations. Genetic diversity is maintained in both wild populations but is decreased in cultured populations, which may reduce the overall fitness of this species. Available information suggests that <em>T. rubripes</em> has undergone significant population declines in parts of its range. As a highly-valued foodfish the persistence of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em> is highly dependent on species-specific regulatory measures including an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, mandated release of small fishes, and aquacultured fish to meet increasing consumer demand. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.","<strong>Habitat and depth distribution<br/></strong><em>Takifugu rubripes</em> is a demersal species. Adults are found in inlet waters, occasionally entering brackish waters.  Fingerlings are often seen in brackish river mouths (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) and can tolerate salinities ranging from 25%–100% of that of seawater (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2005). Immature <em>T. rubripes</em> are found in the area between the Seto Inland Sea and the Japanese coast, and they move from the open sea prior to becoming adult fish.&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>&#160;is unable to live deeper than 150 meters and prefers depths of 100 to 135 meters and above on the continental shelf in the western Enshu Nada (Achiha 2006).&#160;Electronic tagging was used to examine the ecology of this species, and revealed a typical diurnal change in swimming depth with seasonal variations. In winter, this species generally occupies the upper 10 m of the water column, and dives to depths reaching 90 m. In autumn the main swimming layer ranged from the surface to the upper 30 m of the water column (Nakajima 2001). This species exhibits burrowing behaviour.<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction and Life History<br/></strong>The age of first maturity has been estimated at two to three years (Yu 2003,&#160;K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Longevity is estimated at nine years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;The results of tagging experiments indicate that adult <em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea migrate to coastal areas in western Japan to spawn. After spawning, the puffer seems to migrate again to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to the Gulf of Bohai (Tagawa 1996). <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> returns to the same spawning ground and strongly shows homing behaviour to its natal spawning grounds (Nakajima and Akira 2005).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em> moves offshore with growth and breeds in the sea (Kato<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005) from March to May. <em>Takifugu rubripes</em> spawns demersal eggs which hatch in four to ten days (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Juveniles mature in shallow bays and river mouths for one year, and then migrate permanently to the open ocean (Kato <em>et al.</em> 2010). Juveniles resemble <em>T. niphobles</em> (Masuda <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Generation length calculation</strong><br/>The generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> has been estimated using the following formula: A<sub>m</sub> + ((A<sub>max</sub> - A<sub>m</sub>)/2), where&#160;A<sub>m </sub>= age at maturity and A<sub>max </sub>= longevity. The estimated generation length of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 5.75 years.<br/><br/><strong>Toxicity<br/></strong>This species bioaccumulates tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Noguchi <em>et al.</em> 2006). The liver and ovaries are highly toxic, the intestines slightly toxic and the  flesh, skin and testes are innocuous (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/><strong><em>Takifugu</em> and Tetraodontidae<br/></strong>As one of the first vertebrates whose genome has been completely sequenced,&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;has become a model organism for genomics studies (Aparicio&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002).&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes&#160;</em>is morphologically similar to&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. pseudommus</span>, and a number of genome-level molecular studies suggest that they are the same species (Cui&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2005), differing only in the color of the anal fin.

Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes.

The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.</em><em>&#160;rubripes</em><em></em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<em>Takifugu chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

This species spawns in shallow coastal waters, and the larvae may be dependent on estuaries for their development.&#160;<em>Takifugu flavidus&#160;</em>is the most highly valued Fugu species in China, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place, however generalized&#160;seasonal fishing prohibitions and the presence of both fresh and marine water preserves in parts of its range may offer this species some protection. There are indications of population decline in this species due to habitat degradation, overfishing and other factors. Historical landings from the Yangtzee River basin show steep declines in landings (95%) from the 1950s to the 1970s, and although recent landing statistics are not available, qualitative assessments by scientists in the region indicate that wild stocks of this species are in a state of decline. It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and the increasing aquaculture of fish to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone. Therefore, it is considered Conservation Dependent and is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened.&#160;Further research is needed to better quantify stock decline, and may reveal that this species qualifies for a higher threat category, especially given its high commercial value. Due to the economic importance of the&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> occurs near shore (Yamada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995) over sandy or muddy bottoms at depths ranging from very shallow waters to 20 metres. Although it does not undergo large migrations (Yang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991), it is known to migrate to coastal areas in the spring and summer to spawn, and then return to deeper waters in the autumn and winter. The larvae may be estuarine-dependent, as they remain in the estuaries and coastal areas for months before entering deeper waters (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). <em>Takifugu flavidus </em>feeds on molluscs and crustaceans. The ovaries, liver, and intestine are highly toxic. The skin is less toxic. The testes are innocuous, but sometimes toxic (Nakabo 2002).<br/><br/>The generation length of <em>T. flavidus</em> is estimated at three to four years (K.

This species is bred in captivity.<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012).

By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population Structure<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> is most closely related to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. bimaculatus</span> (Yamanoue<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008). Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). This species has been crossed with the commercially important <em>T. rubripes</em> in order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Additional Population Information<br/></strong><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span>&#160;is common within its known distribution (Liu and Liu pers comm. 2011). In Japanese markets, this species was observed to be common in 1990s. However, wild and cultured individuals from the market cannot be distinguished (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). This species is primarily harvested from the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay. Due to environmental degradation, overfishing and other factors this species has undergone population declines. <em>Takifugu flavidus</em> is declining in number despite captive cultivation efforts to meet demand (Shi&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). This species may have undergone localized population declines in the Yangtze River basin. Landings from the Yangtze river basin decreased from 1000 tons in 1954, to 130 tonnes in 1968, to &lt;50 tonnes in 1973. (Su and Li 2002)<br/><br/><em>Takifugu flavidus</em>&#160;was not represented in a search of museum collections represented on the FishNet2 database (December 2013).",Decreasing,"<em>Takifugu flavidus</em> is found in the Northwest Pacific in the East China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Su and Li 2002, Nakabo 2002), as well as in the mouths of rivers.&#160;It is found along the coastal waters of the Bohai Sea, coastal waters of Shandong, Dongtou and Zhoushan (Zhejiang), Shanghai, and the mouth of Yangtze River (Nakabo 2002).&#160;It is found at depths ranging from 0–20 metres.","<em>Takifugu flavidus</em> is of commercial importance and has a high market value.<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;</span>It&#160;is mainly sourced from the East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Bohai Bay (Shi <em>et al. </em>2010). In Japan, this species goes by the name ""Sansai-fugu"" (Nakabo 2002). At present, the price of <em>T. flavidus</em> is the highest among puffer species in China (Zhang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). <em>Takifugu flavidus</em>, like other Fugu species,<em>&#160;</em>is primarily caught by bottom long-line fishing, a method which is highly effective at landing <em>Takifugu</em> spp. pufferfishes (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;<p><strong>Aquaculture</strong><strong><br/> </strong>  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu flavidus</span> is cultured in China for export to Japan, where its flesh is consumed as food (Ji <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). Artificial breeding of this high-value species is occurring in order to  continue to meet consumer demands despite declining numbers (Shi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). This species has been crossed with the commercially important <em>T. rubripes</em>  in order to maximize desirable traits both parent species, creating a  commercially-desirable hybrid suitable for aquaculture (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>)). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (&gt;50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. flavidus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. flavidus</em>. Additionally,<em> T. flavidus </em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>    <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>    <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>    <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p><strong></strong>","",,false,false,Global

Given the dramatic declines in these habitats, we infer that  comparable regional declines are likely throughout its range.  Globally, the highest proportion of threatened mangrove species is found  along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al.</span> (2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a  rate of 2% per year. Four of the 10 (40%) mangrove species present  along the Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia are listed  in one of the three threatened categories, and a fifth species, <span style=""font-style: italic;""> Rhizophora samoensis</span>, is listed as Near Threatened (Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2010). Global declines in seagrasses and coral reefs are also significant within this species' range. Therefore, we conservatively estimate habitat loss of at least 20% in the last 35  years (three generation lengths), and infer similar declines in the  population of <em>A. vulpes</em>.<br/><br/>Since bonefish rely upon habitats of limited extent, they are  especially susceptible to habitat loss and degradation, particularly due  to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often  fragmented in nature, exacerbating this issue. As with other coastal  species, fragmentation will likely have direct and indirect negative  impacts on bonefish. This species exhibits high site fidelity, and is therefore especially vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. <em>Albula vulpes</em> is listed as Near Threatened, as it nearly meets the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A2c, and there are examples of localized Vulnerability in the Florida Keys, St. Croix (US Virgin Islands), Bermuda and the Yucatan Peninsula. Additional information about the direction and magnitude of regional population trends will warrant future attention.","Bonefish in the Bahamian Archipelago generally inhabit shallow, nearshore waters (Kaufman 2000). Studies on localized movements of bonefish suggest that adults utilize a range of nearshore habitats, including seagrass beds, mangroves, and even coral reefs (Colton and Alevizon, 1983, Cooke and Philipp 2004, Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). They are also found on sand flats, mud flats, marl flats, algae beds, and other shallow water habitats. They are both subtidal and intertidal. Articles in popular angling publications indicate that bonefish are also observed and often caught on sandy flats devoid of benthic vegetation (Layman and Silliman 2002, Layman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Nero and Sullivan-Sealey 2005). In the Florida Keys and Belize, 96% of juveniles caught along sandy beaches were <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula</span> sp. B and 4% were <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span> (Adams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Similarly, collections by Snodgrass <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2010) in the Florida Keys and Bahamas were dominated by<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Albula</span> sp.

One hundred percent of juveniles and sub-adults captured along beaches north of Miami in the US have been identified as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula</span> sp. B.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diet</span><br/>Several diet studies have been conducted on bonefish in the western Atlantic (e.g., Warmke and Erdman 1963, Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1998),  suggesting that bonefish feed predominately on benthic invertebrates  (bivalves and crabs) but occasionally on small fishes. However, given  the taxonomic confusion surrounding this genus, these studies may have  included multiple species of bonefish. There are size and location differences in diet (Adams pers. comm. 2011). In the Bahamas, specimens less than 16 inches primarily feed on polychaete worms and bivalves; individuals over 16 inches primarily feed on crustaceans (shrimps, crabs) and fishes. To some extent, diet reflects habitat.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Reproduction</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/>Albula vulpes</span> exhibits seasonal reproductive activity throughout its Caribbean range (from October through April) with most activity occurring in fall-winter and early spring months (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Spawning is presumed to occur in deep water off the coral reef shelf edge, away from principal foraging grounds (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1997). Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2011) used sonic tracking to demonstrate offshore migrations for spawning. They spawn primarily during the full moon phase but possibly at the new moon phase as well (Adams pers. comm. 2011). They gather in pre-spawning aggregations in protected areas near deeper water. Spawning occurs at night. Recent aging of large bonefish has revealed that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span> live to at least 20 years (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). There is evidence that suggests that 20 years may be a conservative estimate of longevity. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Growth and Development</span><br/>Growth rates in the Florida Keys differ from those in the Caribbean by 2–3 times (growth rates are faster in the Keys). Age at maturity is 3.5 years (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). 50% maturity for male occurs at 418 mm, and at an age of 3.6 years. Females mature (50%) at 4.2 years and 488 mm (Florida Keys, Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). The smallest sexually mature bonefish observed was 358 mm. In the Cayman Islands, a ripe female was found measuring 342 mm (Adams <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Growth is rapid until six years, when the growth rate slows (Crabtree <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1996). There are sexually dimorphic patterns of growth. The largest size recorded for this species is 702 mm TL (Crabtreet <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>1996).&#160; <br/><br/>Genetic sampling shows that 98% of the recreational fishery throughout the Caribbean is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>. There are two genetically identifiable co-occurring populations in the Caribbean and both populations are pan-Caribbean (Wallace unpublished data).<br/><br/>Tagging studies in the Florida Keys (Larkin unpublished data) and in the Caribbean (Adams pers comm. 2011) indicate that greater than 70% of recaptures are within five miles of tagging reefs. However, dart tagging and sonic tracking have revealed movements over 140 miles (Haley 2009). Long distance movements on Andros, Bahamas appear to be associated with spawning migrations. There were two bonefish tagged in the upper Florida Keys that were recaptured in Andros, Bahamas.<br/><br/>This species has leptocephali larvae. Mean larval duration is 41–71 days (Mojica<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span>  1995). They recruit in summer and winter, indicating prolonged  spawning. Recruitment occurs at night, with recruits present in the  upper meter of the water column (Mojica <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995). Victor (pers. comm. 2011) found that the leptocephali larvae were positively photo-taxic.<br/><br/>Using  equation number five of section 4.4 of the Guidelines for Using  the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions  Working Group 2008), if generation length = age of first reproduction +  z*(length of the reproductive period), and age at first reproduction is  estimated at 3.5 years, z is estimated to be 0.5 based on survivorship  and relative fecundity with age, and the length of the reproductive  period is estimated at 16.5 years (20 years - 3.5 years = 16.5 years), then generation length for this species is estimated to  be 11.75 years.","This species is targeted by recreational fishermen in Florida (US) and throughout the Caribbean, including Cuba (Valdez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008) Belize (Pritchett 2008), Venezuela (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), and The Bahamian Archipelago (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>Although the use of bonefish as a subsistence food item has declined in recent  decades in The Bahamas (Rudd 2003), commercial gill nets have been employed in some  areas, resulting in excessive harvests of bonefish and substantial  bycatch of other species, including turtles, barracudas, dolphins and  sharks (Clark and Danylchuk 2003).<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on bonefish have been intensively studied (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007, 2008), Cooke and Philipp (2004) and Suski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (unpublished data). Handling time and handling behaviour by anglers, and the presence/absence of predators significantly effect post-release survival. Hook type and hook retention does not affect post-release survival. For bonefish held in live wells, flow-through ambient water is best for post-release survival. &#160; Post-release survival may be negatively correlated with high temperatures.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation are the most significant threats to this species. Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and disruption of prey species dynamics. Disruptions to shallow coastal ecosystems due to climate change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and urbanization.&#160; Increasing water temperatures may also exceed the thermal maximum of bonefishes (36.4–40.6°C) (Murchie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats.

Globally, between 20% and 35% of mangrove area have been lost since approximately 1980, and mangrove areas are disappearing at the rate of approximately 1% per year (Valiela <em>et al. </em>2001, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 2007).&#160; The highest proportion of threatened mangrove species is found along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America.

Bill Curtis, a legendary professional bonefish guide and a member of the 2012 class of IGFA Legendary Captains and Crew, estimated that by the early 2000s, the visible bonefish population had declined 90% compared to the late 1940s (Curtis 2004). Numerous long-time Florida Keys anglers corroborate the declines described by Curtis (2004); causes for the declines are unknown. In other locations where netting has occurred, populations have been eradicated or size distributions have been truncated (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Unit stock and stock sizes remain virtually unknown, and fishery impacts on the region are largely unknown and remain areas for future evaluation. A recent population census in the Florida Keys indicates that the population remained relatively constant from 2003–2005 (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Connectivity and larval transport among subpopulations are not well understood, but genetic research indicates sufficient gene flow to support a single stock.<br/></p><p>Although it is recognized that this species is distributed throughout the Bahamas Archipelago, no formal studies have been conducted to determine their distribution and relative abundance across spatial or temporal scales (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).

Genetic surveys have detected it only in the Caribbean (Pfeiler 1996, Colborn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2001), Florida and the Bahamas. Thus, the species, once believed to be global in scope (Briggs 1960, Alexander 1961), now has one of the most restricted distributions among bonefishes (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). No type locality exists, but Eschmeyer (1998) suggests that the type location may have been the Bahamas. Larvae have been collected as far north as Rhode Island.","This species is targeted by recreational fishermen throughout the Caribbean, including Cuba (Valdez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008) Belize (Pritchett 2008), Venezuela (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), and The Bahamian Archipelago (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). An economically important recreational fishery is also present in the state of Florida, USA, where the overall economic impact of recreational fisheries greatly surpasses the current commercial fishery revenues (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission   2005). Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2008) estimated the value of a bonefish in the Florida Keys at $75,000 per individual over the lifetime of the fish; however, this estimate may differ from that of a new study on the economic value of the flats fishery in the Florida Keys (bonefish, tarpon, permit) (Adams pers. comm. 2011).<br/> <br/> In the Bahamas, the total economic value of the recreational bonefish fishery is greater than $140 million annually (Fedler 2010). In Belize, the flats fishery (bonefish, tarpon and permit) exceeded $25 million annually (Fedler 2008). There is no evidence of international trade;&#160; all consumption and sale appears to be local (Adams pers. comm. 2011).<br/><br/>For generations, bonefish have been the focus of subsistence and artisanal fisheries throughout the Caribbean (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Subsistence and small-scale commercial harvesting in this area was traditionally conducted in relatively shallow waters using handline, seine nets and gill nets (Olsen 1986). Use of bonefish as a subsistence food item has declined in recent decades (Rudd 2003), and commercial gill nets have been employed in some areas of the Turks and Caicos, resulting in excessive harvests of bonefish and substantial bycatch of other species, including turtles, barracudas, dolphins and sharks (Clark and Danylchuk 2003). Gill nets are also utilized in the Bahamas, Belize, and Cuba (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Gill nets were responsible for eradicating the bonefish population in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Bonefish&#160; have gained importance as a target species for specialized recreational anglers in many locations in the Caribbean (sensu Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). The use of gill nets to target bonefish and other near-shore species is becoming more common in the Bahamas and Belize (Adams pers. comm. 2011). Angling for bonefish has become extremely popular, as their powerful swimming abilities when hooked make them a challenge to catch using lightweight fly-fishing and conventional hook and line gears (Kaufman 2000, Davidson 2004, Fernandez 2004).<br/><br/>Artisinal fishers in Venezuela historically targeted <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, although the use of seine nets was banned in the 1980s. Since then, bonefish are only caught occasionally by artisinal fishers using small pocket nets (Posada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008).<br/><br/>In various regions (Bahamas, Belize, wider Caribbean Sea), bonefish are often used as bait for catching large pelagic or reef fishes (marlin, grouper, etc.) (Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).",Marine|Marine,"Despite their ecological and economic importance, fishery regulations for bonefish across the Bahamian Archipelago are limited (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). In the Bahamas, the capture of bonefish using nets and the commercial trade of bonefish are prohibited (Bahamas Department of Fisheries 1986). In the Turks and Caicos Islands,&#160; there are no specific regulations (Turks and Caicos Islands Government 1998). In an effort to conserve fish stocks and their habitats, both countries are using marine protected areas in conjunction with existing fisheries regulations to build sustainable fisheries and protect marine biodiversity.&#160; Catch-and-release is commonly practised by recreational anglers with a strong conservation ethic who travel to the region. Research is needed to identify whether unique bonefish stocks occur in the Bahamian Archipelago, since stock mixing could significantly complicate management of the species (Danylchuk <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). In Belize and Puerto Rico, bonefish are catch-and release-only. In Florida, this species became catch-and-release only in 2011 (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission). Enforcement is lacking throughout this species' range.<br/><br/>Rising exploitation pressures, rapid human development within this  species' range, and environmental changes in coastal waters suggest that  new information on population dynamics and resource ecology is  critically needed to support fishery management strategies to conserve  this species (Ault<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008).<br/><br/>This species is found in numerous Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)  throughout its range.

2317059,194344,Lutjanus synagris,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widely distributed, can be abundant in many nearshore, mid-shelf and shelf-edge habitats and is fished throughout its range. It can form spawning aggregations targeted by fishermen, making it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Substantial declines in landings have been documented on the US Atlantic coast, US Gulf of Mexico, Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, and elsewhere. Landings declines of over 30%, without major recovery over an estimated three generation length period of 15-18 years, have occurred in Cuba. Declines of over 70% have occurred in both US commercial and recreational fisheries. Declines in landings of 95% over 21 years have been recorded for Mexico. Multi-year information on declines is not currently available from most other regions. In Brazil, several modeling studies suggest varying levels of overfishing. It is consistent with the information that is available to estimate that the species has undergone at least 20% declines in biomass over three generation lengths around the region and given its susceptibility to spawning overfishing, it is listed as Near Threatened. Management interventions exist to varying degrees in some regions. It is suggested that precautionary management measures be taken to protect spawning aggregations and that fisheries data be collected for parts of the species range for which population data is lacking.","This species is found in a variety of habitats, often around coral and rocky reefs and on vegetated sandy areas. This species is found in turbid as well as clear waters (Lieske and Myers 1994). It sometimes also enters tidal creeks. Early life stages can be found among a variety of structural habitat types including settlers in seagrasses and also nearshore hardbottom (Lindeman and Snyder 1999). In Brazil, <em>L. synagris</em> is one of the most abundant fish species found in the Rio Formoso region of Pernambuco (Paiva 2006).<br/><br/>This species feeds at night on small fishes, bottom-living crabs, shrimps, worms, gastropods and cephalopods (Claro and Lindeman 2008). On the Caribbean coast of Colombia, small juveniles appear to be generalist predators, while larger individuals are more specialized; the main prey items were portunid crabs, gastropods, mantis shrimp and paneid shrimp (Doncel and Paramo 2010). Franks and VanderKooy (2015) found Lane Snapper consumed a variety of prey organisms, but primary prey were amphipods, decapods and fishes.<br/><br/>There are multi-species spawning aggregations off the coast of Cuba that include this species, with the largest production on the southwest coast (Claro and Lindeman 2003). One potential aggregation site was reported by fishers in the lower Florida Keys (Lindeman<em> et al.</em> 2000). On the Abrolhos Bank off Brazil, this species spawns twice annually, with a peak between September and October and another between February and March; substantial fishing of spawning aggregations in Brazil has been reported (Freitas <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2014).&#160;Based on size frequency and otolith studies in Bermuda, maximum lifespan was 19 years and 90% of growth was accomplished in the first four years (Luckhurst <em>et al</em>. 2000). Lifespan was estimated at 10 years in the US Atlantic (SERO 2011), 19 years in the US Gulf of Mexico (SERO 2010), 17 years in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1995),&#160;12 years in Jamaica (Aiken 2001), approximately 10 years in Cuba (Claro and Reshetnikov 1981), and up to seven years in Trinidad (Manickchand-Dass 1987). The estimated age of first maturity in the US Gulf of Mexico and US Atlantic is one year (SERO 2010, SERO 2011). The age of maturation used in Florida Keys analyses was 2.4 years (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998). Males reach sexual maturity at a slightly smaller size than females (Claro 1982). Size at 50% maturity was 23.5 cm (FL) for males and 24.5 cm (FL) for females, corresponding to an age of approximately one to two years, in Bermuda (Luckhurst <em>et al</em>. 2000) and in Cuba 19 and 18 cm FL for females and males respectively (Claro 1982). We estimated generation length to range from five to six years. Maximum size is reached at approximately 60 cm (Allen 1985).","This species is taken by a variety of gear types, including seine, trap, hook and line, and trammel net, and is often a significant component of the landings from directed demersal fisheries. Evidence of overfishing exists for various regions (see Population section). Juveniles of the species are also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls in many regions. Both <em>L. synagris</em> and <em>L. griseus</em> were estimated to have had a high risk of oil encounters from the BP Horizon Oil Spill based on spawning season and cross-shelf larval distribution for each species (Fodrie and Heck 2011).<br/><br/>This species is commercially important throughout its range. In Brazil, as other species in the lutjanid complex decline, this species is growing in relative importance in catches, becoming a primary target in several states. Although this species is considered overexploited in Brazil, few management measures are in place; primarily consisting of marine protected areas (Resende<em> et al.</em> 2003, Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). Substantial fishing of spawning aggregations in eastern Brazil has been reported (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation may be occurring in Cuba due to hyper-salinization of inner lagoons, damage to <em>Thalassia </em>beds from hurricanes, and changes in water circulation in coastal areas (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Juveniles occur in shallow habitats such as mangroves, seagrasses and hardbottom, which can all be subject to degradation or elimination by coastal construction projects (e.g., Lindeman and Snyder 1999). Adults of the species are closely associated with corals and a variety of direct and indirect threats may arise with increasing climate change impacts on corals and associated habitats (Ateweberhan <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The species is not prominent in catches above the Cape Canaveral area of east Florida. Commercial landings total 166.1 mt over 62 years in the US Atlantic. In the US Atlantic, commercial landings ranged from 0.1 in 1952 to a peak of 15.7 mt in 1979, declining to 0.5 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). Considering a three generation length range of 15-18 years to 2013, commercial landings for this species has declined 84% over 12 years, 90% over 23 years, and 72% over 30 years (NMFS 2015a). Currently, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council considers the stock not overfished nor undergoing overfishing. Most US catches are in state, not federal, waters. In Florida, peak landings for commercial and recreational fisheries, 480 mt, were in 1984 with substantial declines on the order of approximately 70% through 2013 (FWRI 2014, Figures 2 and 3). The spawning potential ratio (SPR) in the Florida Keys was estimated at 74% in Ault <em>et al</em>. (1998). In the US Gulf of Mexico, <em>L. synagris</em> is not considered to be undergoing overfishing and it is unknown whether it is overfished or approaching overfished conditions (NMFS 2015b). This species is more prominent in the US Gulf of Mexico than in the US Atlantic, where commercial landings of <em>L. synagris</em> increased from 12.8 mt in 1965 to a peak of 66.5 mt in 1991, followed by a steady decline to 11.4 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). The commercial landings demonstrate a decline of 82.9% over 23 years from 1991 to 2013, which falls within the 15-18 year three generation length range. However, peak landings may represent a shift in the fishery toward this species as Red Snapper,<em> L. campechanus</em>, and some groupers declined. Recreational landings fluctuated greatly over the last 35 years, starting with 58 mt in 1981, with a peak catch of 457 mt in 1984, a second peak catch of 235 mt in 1991, and a minimum catch of 10.5 mt in 2011 (NMFS 2015c). The preliminary estimate of recreational landings for 2015 is 57 mt (NMFS 2015c). Based on these two peak landings dates, the recreational landings declined by 87.5% over 32 years to 75.7% over 25 years by 2015.<br/><br/>In Mexico, commercial landings increased from 100 mt in 1970 to a peak in 2,745 mt in 1993, followed by a substantial decline to 142 mt in 2013 (FAO 2015), representing a decline in landings of 95% in 21 years. This species is caught in the commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus </em>(Red Snapper) off Mexico and juveniles are caught as bycatch in shrimp trawls (SAGARPA 2012).<br/><br/>Catch landings on the Cuban Shelf declined more than 50% since the peak of the fishery in the 1970s, and the fishery is considered to be highly exploited (Baisre 2000, Baisre <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are over 40 years of time series showing sharp declines in abundance of spawning aggregations in Cuba (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). This species was the most important commercial fish of the Cuban shelf until the mid-1970s when stocks greatly declined in the most productive region, the Gulf of Batabano. Reported commercial landings increased from 1,000 mt in 1959 to 4,300 mt in 1969; landings remained fairly stable until 1978 (FAO 2015). Reported landings decreased to about 1,300 mt by 1980, followed by nearly 20 years of variable but low abundance, including a low of 694 mt in 2005, to 1,205 mt in 2013 (FAO 2015). Overall, landings decreased by 72% over 45 years, however considering the three generation length range, commercial landings declined by 35% over the last 30 years and 43% over the last 12 years to 2013 (FAO 2015). In the 1980s, some conventional measures of fishery protection were implemented; however, recovery of stocks did not occur. Besides the Gulf of Batabano, spawning aggregations were also intensively fished by trawling in the Archipelago Sabana-Camagüey and Archipelago Jardines de la Reina. Protective measures that were introduced were generally not successful (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>This species is important in commercial and recreational fisheries in the Caribbean and in Bermuda. In some areas of the Caribbean, this species appears to have experienced significant declines prior to the mid-1970s, but populations since the mid-1990s may be relatively stable but at lower numbers (Baisre 2000, Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stalling 2009). In a 15 year study period (1994-2008) in the greater Caribbean based on REEF online database (www.reef.org), this species was sighted evenly or at increasing frequencies even in areas of increasing human density (Stalling 2009).<br/><br/>Landings in Bermuda from 1975 to 1992 showed a general increase through the mid-1980s reached a peak of 15,165 kg in 1987; 80 to 90% of landings were derived from fish-pots (Luckhurst 1996). In an effort to maintain catch levels, there was an expansion of the commercial line fishery, with landings increasing to 20,000 kg in the two years following a fish-pot ban. Commercial landings stabilized at approximately 1,000 kg for the next four years, followed by a significant decline in 1997 to under 10,000 kg. However, it is unknown if this decline was effort-related (Luckhurst 1996). The presence of older year classes in studies conducted in 2000 suggest that the exploitation rate in the Bermuda fishery is not yet sufficiently high to have removed them at the present level of fishing mortality (Luckhurst <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/>From 1988 to 2008,<em> L. synagris</em> was one of the most frequently caught species of fish in Puerto Rican commercial landings (Matos-Caraballo 2000). Yield-per-recruit analyses of lane snapper in Puerto Rico showed that yield increased as the length-at-capture was increased to about 7.9 inches fork length (FL) and when the instantaneous fishing mortality (F) was higher than 0.5 per year (Acosta and Appeldoorn 1992). In Colombia, this species can be the most important lutjanid in the fishery (Acero and Garzon 1985). The species is also highly valued in Venezuela (Cervigon 1993). In the Suriname commercial groundfish fishery, a 79% reduction of daily catch per unit effort of <em>L. synagris</em> was observed from 0.498 mt/day in 1998 to 0.103 mt/day in 2011 (Seijo 2013). Additionally, <em>L. synagris</em> is also caught as part of the Venezuelan Red Snapper fleet fishery (Seijo 2013). Recent genetic studies of&#160;<em>Lutjanus synagris</em>&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico (Karlsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009) and the wider Caribbean (Gold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) found significant differences in microsatellites and mtDNA between subpopulations. In particular, in the Gulf of Mexico there appear to be two subpopulations: one in the western Gulf and one in the eastern Gulf, with the western Gulf subpopulation providing more migrants to the eastern subpopulation than the reverse (Karlsson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009). Although the subpopulation in the Florida Keys was significantly different that in the US Caribbean (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and St. Croix), there appeared to be more migration from the US Caribbean to the Florida Keys than the reverse (Gold&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Bio-physically coupled ocean circulation modelling suggested limited low levels of snapper larval connectivity between sites around Cuba to U.S. waters (Paris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>This species is important in many reef fisheries of Brazil (Freitas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and considered overexploited in many areas (e.g., Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2006, REVIZEE 2006). In an assessment off northeast Brazil from 1996 to 2000, the biological reference point mortality (0.029) for this species was 85% less than current fishing mortality, a sign of overexploitation, and over a period of four years, estimated biomass declines occurred from 13,100 to 12,000 individuals in northeastern Brazil (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009). According to FAO (2015), commercial landings have increased from 506 mt in 1995 to 1,689 mt in 2013. In a stock assessment conducted by Klippel <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2005) in eastern Brazil, the stock was considered to be moderately overexploited. In the Abrolhos Reef System, the species ranked third among lutjanids in percentage of total biomass (Francini-Filho 2008).",Decreasing,"This western Atlantic species is distributed from North Carolina south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Santa Catarina, Brazil (Cervigón 1993, Hostim-Silva <em>et al</em>. 2006). Its maximum depth is 400 m (Anderson 2002), but the species is typically in much shallower waters over continental and insular shelves.","Important commercial and recreational fisheries exist for this species throughout its range and is considered a substantial part of the commercial landings in Puerto Rico (Matos-Caraballo 2000), Cuba (Claro and Lindeman 2003), Bermuda (Luckhurst <em>et al.</em> 2000), Venezuela (Cervigón 1993), Brazil (Klippel <em>et al.</em> 2005) and elsewhere.&#160;This species is an important component of Brazilian reef fisheries, caught primarily by hook and line (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as by longlines and traps. This species is a substantial foreign export from northern Brazil, with approximately 217 mt of <em>L. synagris</em> exported from Rio Grande do Norte between 1996 and 2008 (Cunha<em> et al</em>. 2012).",Marine,"There are catch, season and gear limits on this species in the jurisdictions of the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Fishery Management Councils. In US federal waters, <em>L. synagris</em> is regulated commercially by an 8 inch TL minimum size limit without a trip limit, and recreational fishing regulations include an 8 inch TL size limit within a 10 snapper aggregate in the South Atlantic and 20 within a reef fish aggregate in the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan includes a seasonal prohibition on possessing Lane Snapper from April through June.&#160;There is a minimum catch size of 25 cm (FL) for this species in Bermuda (Luckhurst <em>et al.</em> 2000). Since 1978, Lane Snapper fishing in the Gulf of Batabano, Cuba, has been banned during the three-month spawning period, and an annual limited quota was introduced (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). A permanent closure was established in shallow waters adjacent to the spawning site in 1987. Despite these two protective measures being in place for more than 15 years total, there was no evident recovery. After 1995, limited recovery was observed in the Gulf of Batabanó, and some fishing of spawning aggregations was authorized; however, the further reduction in catch that occurred in the following years resulted in a prohibition of set nets over the entire Cuban platform in 2008 (Claro<em> et al.</em> 2009). The protection of spawning aggregations in all regions is highly advised. This species occurs in marine protected areas of variable effectiveness. Identification of actual spawning sites within and near existing marine protected areas remains a significant challenge (Frietas <em>et al.</em> 2011).","",,false,false,Global

The oocyte diameter distributions suggested restricted spawning in the species. The occurrence of ripe fish in all the samples, however, is an indication of protracted spawning. Although individuals were ready for spawning throughout the year they probably spawned during the upwelling seasons.

During a trawl sampling&#160;off Gabon, north of Sette&#160;Cama in the summer of 1989,&#160;<em>Brachydeuterus auritus</em>&#160;was considered a common species. &#160;This species was found to dominate the shelf assemblage off Congo in the same sampling, comprising 55% of the total catch of the survey (Bianchi 1992).&#160;Based on species landings in FAO in the CECAF region, from 1950 to late 1970 increased steadily to around 30,000 metric tonnes per year, and from 1970 until 2011 landings have fluctuated around 25,000 metric tonnes per year.&#160;There are an estimated 50,0000 tons of&#160;<em>B. auritus</em>&#160;in the subtropical Eastern Central Atlantic (ECA; King 2002). It&#160;was the most abundant species in terms of catch per effort in the Guinean Trawling Survey of Ghana demersal fisheries from 1963 to 1970 and from 1989-2000. In the period of 1979-1988 it was the second most abundant species.&#160;There was an eight-fold increase in effort and a 10-fold increase in catch, but there were no signs of decline from 1963-2000 in the Ghana demersal fishery (Korentang and Pauly 2002).<br/><br/>In Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Ghana, Congo and Angola, this species is considered overexploited (Bannermann and Cowx 2002,&#160;CECAF 2008,&#160;CECAF&#160;2011). Based on limited data from Nigeria, Cameroon, Equitorial Guinea and Sao Tome, this species was also considered to be overexploited (CECAF 2011). In summary, based on biomass, catch and effort, this species is considered overexploited in the majority of its range. Based on CPUE summarized in CECAF 2011 (and data provided by Williams pers. comm. 2013), there has been approximately 50% decline in CPUE in Togo, Benin, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire coastal trawlers&#160;(from about 250 to 100 between 1990 and 2006), with no real trend in artisanal fisheries (average of about 100) from these same countries. Based on these data, it is conservatively estimated to be an approximately 25% decline in overall CPUE for this species in these countries. Based on that this species has been determined to be overexploited throughout the CECAF region, it is assumed that similar trends may be observed across the region (Williams, Sidibe, Sylla, Morais, Camara, Sagna, Djiman, Nunoo and Quartey pers. comm. 2013).&#160;It represents 5% of shrimp fisheries bycatch in Casamance, Senegal (Emanuelsson 2008). Throughout the region, juveniles are likely being targeted in small pelagic beach seines and also in bycatch in shrimp fisheries. &#160;<br/><br/>In Ghana, this species is caught primarily in artisanal fisheries and has high effort with no trends in landings. In Mauritania, it is not directly targeted, but in the southern portion of the country it is taken as bycatch in trawls. In Senegal, it is primarily taken by artisanal fisheries, including beach seine. In Nigeria, this species is primarily caught as by-catch in shrimp fisheries as well as artisanal.&#160;Data through the early parts of the last decade indicate that exploitation is occurring in this fishery. The human population is increasing and food supplies remain scarce in this area, and therefore, we can only conclude that effort is increasing further.&#160;Yield per recruit analysis showed that excessive fishing effort was being exerted on stocks and a very low length at first capture was observed. Corrective measures are recommended with emphasis on co-operation between fishermen and the government in the decision-making process (Bannerman and Cowx 2002). It&#160;represented 2.5% of the fish abundance during a purse seine survey of the Sine Saloum system (estuary) in Senegal in 1992. (Simier 2004).&#160;The CPUE in Ghana fisheries has been fairly stable at least &#160;from 1974 to 1999 (Bannermann and Cox 2002).",Unknown,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Brachydeuterus auritus </span>is found in the eastern Atlantic from  Morocco to Angola, but is more common from Senegal to Angola.","It&#160;is of major commercial importance in some areas along the west African coast (Bannerman 2002, Carpenter in press).

2382420,195475,Rhynchobatus palpebratus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2019,2018-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Eyebrow Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus palpebratus</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 262 cm total length) shark-like ray with an apparently disjunct distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (and marginally into Indonesian waters), the Andaman Sea off Thailand, and Taiwan. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters&#160;at depths of 5-61 m. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Eyebrow Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light. Current records suggest a more widespread occurrence in the Eastern Indian-Western Pacific region. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Eyebrow Wedgefish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the Asian part of the range of the Eyebrow Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The Eyebrow Wedgefish is inferred to have undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) in the Asian part of its range.&#160;However, the bulk of the species' currently recognized distribution is in areas were fishing pressure is low, and management is in place (i.e., Australia). It is therefore inferred that the Eyebrow Wedgefish has undergone a 20-30% population reduction globally over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd. If the species was in fact wider-ranging throughout the Indo-Malay Archipelago/Southeast Asia, as its disjunct distribution suggests, it would likely have undergone population reduction over the last three generations which would be high enough to quality it for a threatened category (possibly as high as Critically Endangered, which is the status of other Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes).",The Eyebrow Wedgefish occurs at depths of 5–61 m on the continental shelf (Compagno and Last 2008). Maximum size is at least 262 cm total length (TL); males mature at 103 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Life history is unknown but wedgefishes are lecithotrophic viviparous with small litter sizes; size at birth in the Eyebrow Wedgefish is 46-50 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009).&#160;Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).,"<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across part of the range of the Eyebrow Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort is high where the species occurs in Asia (Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan). Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand all rank among the top 20 fishing nations globally (Lack and Sant 2011). The high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018) and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia. <br/><br/>Although only thought to occur marginally in Indonesian waters (Last<em> et al. </em>2016), the full distribution of the species is not well understood, and the disjunct records (Australia/New Guinea, Thai Andaman Sea, and Taiwan) suggests that it is/was more widely ranging throughout Southeast Asia. Indonesia has a significant fishing fleet (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (KKP 2016). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Thai commercial fisheries have seen over-capitalization and resource depletion, and commercial fishing pressure on sharks (and undoubtedly wedgefishes) in Thai waters has been extremely high (Pauly and Chuenpagdee 2003, Arunrugstichai <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource in Taiwan, and the potentially very limited distribution of this species raises serious concerns for its ability to sustain historic and current levels of fishing pressure. Taiwan is a major fishing nation with a long history of the exploitation of coastal resources, which were considered to be overfished by the 1950s (and which led to the development of Taiwan's distant water fleet) (Kuo and Booth 2011). Taiwan is a major global shark fin trading nation (Clarke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides a significant refuge for this species given that the bulk of its known range occurs there. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is however unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g., Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur across the range of this species, and is an extensive issue in Taiwan (Kuo and Booth 2011). In northern Australia, where wedgefish account for a minor component of the IUU fishing, activity peaked in the mid-2000s, and although vessel numbers have declined since then, there is still some illegal fishing across northern Australia (Field&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Marshall 2011, Harward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010) and&#160;Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, there are several relevant historical accounts and more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. These historical accounts and contemporary datasets are largely outside the known range of the Eyebrow Wedgefish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009)&#160;(recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj <em>et al.</em> 2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see Supplementary Information).</p><p><br/>The Eyebrow Wedgefish has not been recorded in recent landing site surveys on the Andaman coast of Thailand (<span lang=""EN-US"">Shin Arunrugstichai, pers. comm., 16/01/19).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high where the Eyebrow Wedgefish occurs outside of Australia and Papua New Guinea and while these datasets are primarily outside the range of the Eyebrow Wedgefish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific, with the exception of parts of Australasia. It is therefore inferred that the species has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) in the Asian part of its range. However, the bulk of the species' currently recognized distribution is in areas were fishing pressure is low, and management is in place. Overall, it is therefore inferred that the Eyebrow Wedgefish has undergone a 20-30% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd. If the species was in fact wider-ranging throughout the Indo-Malay Archipelago/Southeast Asia, as its disjunct distribution suggests, it would have likely have undergone population reduction over the last three generations which would be high enough to quality it for a threatened category (possibly as high as Critically Endangered, which is the status of other Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes).</p>",Decreasing,"The distribution of the Eyebrow Wedgefish is poorly-defined&#160;due to confusion with other members of the&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;species-complex. Last <em>et al. </em>(2016) show it occurring only across northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea, but the species description includes a single record from the Andaman Sea off Thailand (Compagno and Last 2008).

The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value&#160;(e.g. Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi&#160;</em>(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W.

This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. Queensland has a recreational possession limit of one shark or ray, and the Northern Territory a possession limit of three. In the major prawn trawl fisheries of northern and eastern Australia, the bycatch of large elasmobranchs has been significantly reduced since 2000 with the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in trawl nets (e.g. Brewer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).

Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management. Given the sparsity of records from outside Australia and Papua New Guinea, the status of the species requires examination in Thailand and Taiwan.

This species is targeted in gillnets and longlines there on offshore islands including the Los Roques Archipelago and Margarita Island, where fisheries are intense (Tavares 2005, Tavares <em>et al. </em>2009). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span lang=""en-AU"">–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Santa Catarina State, this shark is among the target species in driftnets and gillnets (Walker 1998). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s, however there are management measures in place (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006).

Population trend data are available from two fishery independent surveys in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (D.W. Kulka and C.F. Cotton and R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2019), and a stock assessment for the Northwest Atlantic Ocean (SEDAR 2015). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<br/><br/><strong></strong>In the Northwest Atlantic, the relative abundance time series from 1972–2013 (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019) indicated that the population was increasing at an annual rate of 0.3% over three generation lengths (32 years). From 2011–2018, a fishery independent longline survey in the Gulf of Mexico (C.F. Cotton and R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2019) indicated a stable abundance trend. The anlaysis of the stock assessment biomass from the Northwest Atlantic (NFMS 2014, SEDAR 2015) revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.9% from 1981–2012 over the past two generation lengths. The global analysis indicated Dusky Smoothhound is estimated to have increased by 0.2% annually over the past three generation lengths (32 years). The corresponding probabilities for rates of population change fall primarily in Least Concern (78%, see Supplementary Information). Based on these results, the fact that management exists in the United States, and the lack of catches in areas outside US waters, the species is assessed as regionally Least Concern in the Northwest Atlantic. <br/><br/>In the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic, there are no species-specific time series of abundance. This shark is rare in Colombia but there is no baseline there. In Venezuela, it is targeted in intensive fisheries, and there were already reported declines in abundance around Los Roques Archipelago in the 1990s (Tavares 2005). Landings for <em>Mustelus </em>spp. in Venezuela rose through the 1990s and reached a peak in 2004, after which they declined quickly, likely an indication of overfishing (Tavares <em>et al.</em> 2009). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and likely capturing this inshore species and consequently this species is assessed as Endangered A2bd on the National Red List (ICMBio 2018). In Rio Grande do Sul, the Dusky Smoothhound was an abundant migrant in winter at depths of 40–120 m between 1980 and 1983. However, the species was not recorded in trawl surveys in the same area from 1986–2002 (ICMBio 2018). Similarly, there have been steep declines in Uruguay, according to past data from scientific cruises in the southeast and south region, the species was abundant from 1974–1980 and thereafter there was a 70% reduction in the average catch-per-unit-effort until the year 2002 (ICMBio 2018).&#160;There is management in place for the trawl fisheries in Uruguay and Argentina, however there are also gillnet fisheries that likely capture this species; management measures are unknown for this latter fishery. Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, combined with observed declines in Venezuela, it is suspected that the Dusky Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (32 years) in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic part of its range. <br/><br/>Overall, given the moderate increase in abundance in the Northwest Atlantic which comprises more than two-thirds of the geographic range of this species, combined with noted declines in abundance in Venezuela, Brazil, and Uruguay and intense and unmanaged fisheries in parts of the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the Dusky Smoothhound  has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (32 years).",Decreasing,"The Dusky Smoothhound has a disjunct distribution as it occurs in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic from Nova Scotia, Canada to Eastern Venezuela, including the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands, and also in the Southwest Atlantic from Santa Catarina State, Brazil to Chubut, Argentina (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Its distribution in the southern Gulf of Mexico and on the Caribbean coast of Central and South America from Belize to Venezuela needs confirmation.","Houndsharks in general are fished and valued for their meat, liver oil, and fins (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013), and this species is likely to be used similarly where it is fished. The meat is likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold locally in most places, however Brazil does import shark meat under the general name <em>cação</em>, which is in high demand (Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"The United States National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan in 2006. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Dusky Smoothhounds are managed under this plan.

The Tiger Shark is caught by commercial, recreational, and artisanal fisheries as a target species or bycatch. However, records of Tiger Shark catches by many fisheries globally are still largely unknown. The species is one of the major components in catches from shark control programs that target large shark species in Australia, South Africa, and Reunion Island. <em></em>Information on stock assessment, population structure and overall population trends are lacking for much of the species' distribution and available trends in catch rates are based<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;on analyses of the long term shark control programs and on observer surveys from the Western North Atlantic. In Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program showed declines in catch rates since the 1980s and in New South Wales, evidence of a decline was also seen in the last 20 years. Additionally, a significant reduction of the proportion of mature sharks in catches over 60 years suggests shifts in population structure and raises concerns over possible effects from this program on the Tiger Shark population off New South Wales.&#160;The decline off eastern Australia is likely to continue while the shark control programs off Queensland and New South Wales remain active. In the U.S. fisheries of the Western North Atlantic, observer surveys variously recorded increases in Tiger Shark relative abundance and no change in abundance. In South Africa, the beach protection program showed a 3% increase per year in Tiger Shark catch rates. The increasing rates in the Western North Atlantic and South Africa seem consistent with the pattern observed in the first 20 years in Queensland and the interpretation of such upward trends should be made with caution. In the Arabian Seas region, the Tiger Shark has been assessed as Vulnerable based on a suspected decline of at least 30% over the past three generations based on levels of exploitation, with the continued demand from the shark fin market suspected to result in further population reduction in the future.

This species is also targeted by shark control programs in Australia (Paterson 1990, Reid&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently Reunion Island in the Western Indian Ocean. The species has been increasingly exploited by fisheries since the 1950s (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010) due to the increasing demand from the shark fin trade.&#160;Catches of Tiger Shark in directed shark fisheries  have been documented for a number of regions including the western  Atlantic (Hoey and Casey 1986, Berkeley and Campos 1988, Bonfil 1994,  Morgan<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009, Carlson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Brazil (Bonfil 1994), Australia (Stevens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Lyle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Tillett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Papua New Guinea (Kumoru 2013), Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014), Taiwan (Bonfil 1994), India (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015). <br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a common component of the U.S. east coast/Gulf of Mexico commercial shark bottom longline fishery, accounting for 8-36% of the catch (Morgan <em>et al. </em>2009, Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2012). The fishery catches mostly juvenile and subadult Tiger Sharks, although some larger sharks are also taken.&#160;In Australia, the Tiger Shark is targeted by commercial shark fisheries in northern New South Wales and in Western Australia. The species&#160;accounted for 3 tonne (t) and 5.9% of total catch of the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery in eastern Australia. However, catches by this fishery are probably smaller than landings from recreational fisheries in that same area (Park 2007, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In the Western Australia Tropical Shark Fishery, this shark was caught as a target species and annual catches averaged approximately 41 t between 2000 and 2004. This fishery was closed in late 2005 (Department of Fisheries 2005). The&#160;Tiger Shark is relatively common in the Indonesian shark fishery and contributed 5.2% of the total shark biomass of catches from between 2001 and 2006 (White 2007). The Tiger Shark is also commonly caught in the seamount gillnet and longline fishery off the west coast of India, where 242 t and 144 t of various shark species were taken during 2010 and 2011, respectively, but species-specific catches were not recorded (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;The Offshore Net and Line Fishery operating in the northern Australia catches the species incidentally (27 t in 2012), although mesh size is assumed to prevent capture of greater numbers (Lyle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1984, DPFI 2012). This shark is also taken in the Southern and Western Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery in Western Australia with a catch of 112 t reported in 2005-06 (McAuley 2008). The Tiger Shark is a bycatch in trawl fisheries although normally in small numbers and there are few records of catches for these fisheries. The Australian Commonwealth Trawl Sector reported a total catch for the species of 4.7 t from 2004-2011. The&#160;Tiger Shark is caught occasionally in the longline fisheries of Costa Rica (Dapp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), Mozambique (Sousa&#160;2012), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015) and by purse seiners in the Indian Ocean (Chassot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Although little species-specific catch data information is available for the Arabian Seas area, the high level of level of fishing pressure in the region is of concern with steep increases in both small-scale and industrial fishing effort between the 1990s and 2000s (PERSGA 2002, Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In tuna longline fisheries, the species is typically caught in small numbers relative to pelagic sharks and is often not reported. Between 2007 and 2013, an average of 54 t was landed annually by tuna longline boats regulated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT database, P. de Bruyn, pers. comm. 2015). Tiger Shark represented less than 10% of the total bycatch of all shark species in each of the management zones of the U.S. pelagic longline fishery (Mandelman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Panama longline fishery, the Tiger Shark represented 1.6% of shark catches of the estimated total catch of 109,500 t of various sharks since the mid-1980s (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Central and Western Pacific, the Tiger Shark is caught in low numbers (0.025 sharks per set; P. Williams, pers. comm. 2015) by tuna longline boats from most countries operating in that region. <br/>The Tiger shark is a common target of recreational fisheries in the United States, Australia, and South Africa. Approximately 96% of the catch in USA waters are released alive. In the New South Wales Gamefish Tournament, Tiger Shark catches were approximately 8 t per year between 1993 and 2005 (Park 2007). Recreational fishing may account for mortality in the Tiger Shark population in other countries, although catches are unmonitored.<br/><br/>Artisanal fisheries and IUU fisheries are also likely to be catching Tiger Shark, however information about landings from these fisheries is scarce as they remain mostly unmonitored. The Tiger Shark is commonly caught in artisanal fisheries in the tropics and subtropics, including in Mexico (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013), Panama (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014), Brazil (Bornatowski <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pimenta <em>et al</em>. 2014), and a few African countries (FAO 2014). In Bangladesh, landings of 4.5 t represent on average 1.36% of total catch (Jit <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is evidence that the species has been overfished by Indonesian fishing boats at Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Scott Reef in northern Australian waters. This area had been targeted by Indonesian fishermen since the 1800s but fishing was banned in 1988 and 2000, respectively (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in the region showed the absence of Tiger Shark at reefs historically fished despite years of protection whereas they were found present at nearby atolls that had been always protected from fishing (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species comprised 19% of the total shark biomass and 7.4% of total catch in numbers from Indonesian and Taiwanese IUU fishing vessels (Marshall 2011).<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a target species of shark control programs in Queensland (Paterson 1990, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and New South Wales, Australia (Reid et al. 2011), in South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently at Reunion Island. In Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) captured 4,757 Tiger Shark individuals between 1993 and 2010 (Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the species represented approximately 10 to 30% of total catch in the northern locations of the QSCP between 1964 and 2007 (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). Standardized catch rates from 1964-2007 for the QSCP in northern Queensland showed an increase in the relative importance of the Tiger Shark, from approximately 10 to 30% of total catch. This pattern is most likely due to the move in fishing gear from nets to drumlines (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). In southeast Australia, the Tiger Shark was commonly captured by the New South Wales Shark Meshing Program from 1950-2010 with approximately 30 sharks per year between 1950 and 2008, representing approximately 10% of the common shark species caught by the program in each of its locations (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). In South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program has caught approximately 50 individuals annually from 1978-2003. Since 1989, sharks caught alive are released; however, fishing mortality of the Tiger Shark in nets is 27% of captures (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). <br/><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""></span></span></span></span></p><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><p></p></span></span></span></span>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Long-term trends of catch rates of the Tiger Shark are available from regional shark control programs and United States fisheries observer programs. The species is not commonly caught in large numbers by most commercial fisheries and its catch is rarely recorded. Consequently, there is a lack of adequate data for stock assessment, definition of population structure, and documentation of global population trends for the Tiger Shark. </span><br/><br/>In the Western North Atlantic, data from observer surveys (1960-2000) from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center showed an upward trend of the relative abundance of the Tiger Shark with an increase of 6.7% per year since the 1980s. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) logbook data indicated a slow decline from 1986 to 2000 in Tiger Shark relative abundance (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). When logbook and observer data were combined, the relative abundance declined slightly then increased (Baum and Blachard 2010). The Shark Bottom Longline  Observer Program also showed an increase of 8% per year in Tiger Shark  relative abundance between 1994 and 2013. However, the Pelagic Observer  Program from the Southeast Fisheries Science Center showed no change in  abundance for the same period (J. Carlson, pers. comm<em>.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In northeast Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has used a combination of nets and drumlines to target large sharks since 1962 (Paterson 1990). The standardised catch rate of Tiger Sharks in northern Queensland increased until the 1980s and then decreased by the 2000s to approximately 66% of its original value. This trend in catch rate suggests a possible decline in the population between 1964 and 2007 (Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010). The CPUE of Tiger Sharks showed an overall declining trend for the QSCP between 1993 and 2010, with the most significant decline in southern Queensland (Holmes <em>et al. </em>2012). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">In southeast Australia, New South Wales has operated a netting program since 1937 (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011). The CPUE of Tiger Sharks showed marked fluctuations in the first four decades of records, and did not significantly change between 1950 and 2010, although a downward trend in CPUE was observed in the last two decades. The size frequency of Tiger Sharks caught by the program has changed over 60 years with a significant reduction in the proportion of large mature individuals being caught<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. The recent decline in catch rate and decrease in the proportion of large individuals suggests changes in the population structure and raises concern over the effects the program is having on the Tiger Shark population off New South Wales (Reid <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). The  New South Wales game fishing tournaments reported a  decline in CPUE  from approximately 1.2 to 0.5 shark vessel/day  between 1993/94 and  2004/05, with fishers still targeting Tiger Sharks  during the tournaments, suggesting a decline in the population  (Park 2007).</span><br/><br/>In South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program has deployed large-mesh gillnets since 1952. There has been an annual increase of 3% in the CPUE of Tiger Sharks between 1978 and 2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006).&#160;This pattern seems comparable to the pattern observed in the first two decades of the Queensland Shark Control Program in northern Queensland.<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, a significant decrease in shark biomass, mainly carcharhinids, has been reported since the 1970s from trawl surveys and interviews with fishers (Valinassab <em>et al.</em> 2006, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015, Jabado and Spaet 2017). The Tiger Shark was formerly common in Eritrea and Iranian Gulf waters but interviews with fishermen have indicated large declines in landings (I. Elhassan unpubl. data, F. Owfi pers. comm. 06/02/2017). Surveys in the UAE have recorded a decline of approximately 90% in the landings of the Tiger Shark (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015, E. Grandcourt pers. comm. 06/02/2017) and the species has been absent from recent surveys in the Red Sea, where once it was reported to be common (Bonfil 2003, Kattan 2014, Spaet <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Pakistan and India, declines of 20-30% in the Tiger Shark have been recorded with an absence of individuals larger than 3 m in length in catches (M. Khan and Akhilesh K.V. pers. obs., Akhilesh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Tiger Shark is suspected to have undergone declines of at least 30-50% in the Arabian Sea over the last three generations (53 years) based on current levels of exploitation and the decline is likely to be ongoing and it was assessed as Vulnerable A2cd+3cd in the Arabian Seas region (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark has been shown to be at risk in the Arabian Seas region from fishing pressure, and from some shark control programs in other regions. The widespread distribution of this species increases the likelihood that it will survive increasing levels of exploitation in certain areas. Given the wide range of the species and the localities of the shark control programs, the Tiger Shark is suspected to have undergone an overall population reduction of close to 30% globally over the past three generations (53-68 years) based on actual levels of exploitation.&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">A&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">further population reduction is suspected over the future three generation lengths (2018-2086) based on current levels of exploitation that are likely to continue into the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></span>",Decreasing,"<p>The Tiger Shark&#160;has a circumglobal range in tropical and warm temperate oceans, ranging between latitudes of approximately 40°N to 36°S. In the western Atlantic, the species ranges from the USA (Massachusetts) to Uruguay, including the Gulf of Mexico, islands of the Caribbean, and isolated islands such as Fernando de Noronha. In the eastern Atlantic, it is found along the West Africa coast, from Morocco to Angola, including the Canary Islands and the Azores (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It has been reported off Libya in the Mediterranean, though whether it is resident or vagrant is unknown (Tobuni<em> et al. </em>2016). &#160; <br/><br/>This shark is distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, the Tiger Shark is found from the east coast of Africa to South Africa, including remote islands such as Reunion and Chagos Archipelago, north to the Red Sea, and throughout the tropical Indian Ocean. In the western and central Pacific, it occurs from Australia north to eastern China and Japan, and throughout Pacific islands including Palau, east to the Solomon, Marshall, and Hawaiian Islands, south to northern New Zealand, as well as French Polynesia and more isolated atolls (Compagno 1984, Randall 1992). In the eastern Pacific, it ranges from southern California to Peru, including the Galapagos and Revillagigedo Islands.<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark also appears seasonally in cool temperate waters, most likely following warmer currents. The presence of this shark in temperate regions has been reported from the United Kingdom (Compagno 1984) and Iceland (Matsumoto<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2005) in the Atlantic, <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Alaska in the Northeast Pacific (Mecklenburg <em>et al.</em> 2002), the southern coasts of New South Wales and Western Australia in Australia (Pepperell 1992, Holmes&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2014, Ferreira&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2015), and in South Africa (Dicken and Hosking 2009).</span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></span></span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Tiger Shark is taken as both target and incidental catch in commercial, small-scale, and artisanal fisheries.

The current Fisheries Management Program for the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico includes quotas and fishing seasons to regulate catch of coastal shark species including the Tiger Shark (Carlson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). On the west and south coasts of Western Australia, a maximum size of 70 cm interdorsal length is applied for whaler sharks taken by recreational shark fishing, which includes the Tiger Shark. In Queensland, the maximum size allowed is 150 cm for all shark species and a possession limit of one shark of any species is imposed to recreational fishing. Similarly, in New South Wales, only one Tiger Shark can be taken per person per day. Some countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the Maldives), whereas others impose seasonal bans on shark fishing (Iran, the UAE) (Jabado and Spaet 2017).<br/></p><p><br/></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, although most of the take is bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. Generally, Blue Sharks are retained for the fins, although the demand for meat is likely increasing. The steepest population declines have occurred in the North and South Atlantic, with lesser declines in the Indian Ocean, and increases in the Pacific.

It also occurs in inshore waters where the continental shelf is narrow (Last and Stevens 2009). The Blue Shark is highly migratory with movement patterns associated with  reproduction and prey distribution (Nakano and Stevens 2008). The species reaches a maximum size of  about 380 cm total length (TL) (Hart 1973). Males mature at 183–218 cm TL, females mature at 183–221 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Nakano 1994, Carrera-Fernandez <em>et al</em>. 2010). Reproduction is placental viviparous with a gestation of 9–12 months, an annual to biennial reproductive cycle, and large litters sizes of 4–135 (usually 25–35), with a size at birth of 35–60 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Stevens 1984, Nakano 1994, Hazin <em>et al.</em> 1994, Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is minor regional variation in female age at maturity  at 5–6 years in the Atlantic and 5–8 years in the Pacific with a maximum  age of 15.5–16 years in both regions; generation length is therefore 10  years in the Atlantic and 10.5 years in the Pacific (Nakano 1994,  Skomal and  Natanson 2003, Blanco-Parra <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jolly <em>et al</em>. 2013). There are age studies with a greater maximum age of up to 28.6 years, however these are theoretical longevity estimates and the maximum ages have not been validated (Hsu <em>et al. </em>2011, 2012, 2015; Rice and Semba 2014,&#160;Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2019).

At-vessel hooking mortality from commercial Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic is relatively low (13.3%), but smaller individuals have higher probabilities of mortality than larger adults (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2013).

The Blue Shark showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.06 (time range 56 years) and biomass of -0.13 (time range 49 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 96.5–99.8% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2008).

The species has been reported from areas with intensive fishing effort, such as India, where targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fisheries occur (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). Post-release mortality for the species is unknown, although at vessel mortality from demersal longline fisheries has been estimated at 24% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Small specimens are likely to be discarded (Hacohen-Domene&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020), and large specimens may also be discarded in fisheries where there is no market value (K.K.

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope and inhabits depths down to 100 m and occasionally to 500 m deep. This skate is captured in intense artisanal and commercial demersal trawl and longline fisheries and recreational fisheries in Argentina. Research trawl surveys conducted on the southern Brazilian shelf indicate a reduction in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 94% between 1980 and 2005. In Uruguay, research surveys exhibit an increase in catch-per-unit-effort between 1984 and 2008 followed by a  stabilization. Overall, the Smallnose Fanskate is  subjected to intense largely unregulated fishing pressure across most of its range, but is  able to survive when discarded. The larger part of this species' range is in central and southern Argentina where fishing mortality is likely to be lower. Due to the level of fisheries mortality that this species is exposed in the northern part of its range, balanced with lower pressure in the south, and its high survivorship  when discarded, it is suspected that the Smallnose Fanskate has  undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the  past   three  generations (49.5 years), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Smallnose Fanskate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 0–100 m and occasionally to 500 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of 88 cm total length (TL); females mature at 51–74 cm TL and males at 50–69 cm TL (Oddone and Velasco 2004, Basallo and Oddone 2014, Weigmann 2016, Estalles <em>et al. </em>2017). Nursery areas are suspected to be in estuaries where adults and juveniles are more abundant than other areas (Mabragaña <em>et al. </em>2002). Age-at-maturity is 9 years for both sexes and maximum age is 24 and 19 years for females and males, respectively (Hozbor and Massa 2015). Generation length is therefore estimated to be 16.5 years.","The Smallnose Fanskate is captured in artisanal and commercial demersal trawl and longline fisheries, which are intense in at least half of its range. It is also targeted in recreational fisheries in some areas. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are over-exploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (<em></em>Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). The industrial fleet, which mainly targets hake, croaker, and weakfish, increased from 46 vessels in 1975 to a peak of 121 in 2004, followed by a decline to 81 vessels in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the expansion phase of this fishery, landings increased six-fold from 1975 to 1981. Subsequent depletion of these species led to a diversification of the fisheries into non-traditional (i.e. bycatch) species, masking the decline in previous target species (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). Reported bycatch is not identified to species level, and chondrichthyan species are registered in the fisheries statistics grouped into generic names (Paesch and Domingo 2003). This species is captured but discarded in Uruguayan artisanal fisheries (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). The shrimp fishery there takes a lot of bycatch, including this species in relatively large numbers (Cedrola <em>et al. </em>2005). This species is typically discarded from this fishery, but it is suspected to have a high survival rate (J.M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018). Maximum size of individuals was reduced by 10 cm TL between 1995 and 2005 (J.M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018). This skate is targeted in recreational fisheries in Argentina, which are poorly regulated in most areas. Such fisheries have been in operation since at least the 1960s, when large tournaments with up to 4,000 participants began to be held (Venerus and Cedrola 2017). Overall, the Smallnose Fanskate is subjected to intense fishing pressure across most of its range, but is able to survive when discarded as it is in some areas.","In southern Brazil, research trawl surveys indicate a reduction in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of <span style="""">94% between 1980 and 2005 </span>(Ferreira <em>et al. </em>2010<em></em>). In Uruguay, research surveys revealed an increase in catches between 1984 and 2008 followed by a stabilization (L. Paesch unpubl. data 2018). In 794 research trawls conducted in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone between 2010 and 2016, this skate was the most common and was recorded in 490 hauls, or 67%. It made up nearly a quarter of the skate catch by weight (Paesch 2018). In the Rio del Plata Estuary, the landings of coastal rays including this species was low until the mid-1990s, but increased retention led to substantial increases in landings which peaked in 2008, followed by a decline (Chiaramonte 2014, Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the San Matías Gulf, Argentina, this skate was the most common elasmobranch by number in trawl fisheries between 2004 and 2010 (Estalles 2012), and it is targeted in relatively intense recreational fisheries (Venerus and Cedrola 2017). It is suspected that a modest reduction in population size has occurred in Argentina. Due to the level of fisheries mortality that this species is exposed to    across its range, combined with the fact that it is still observed  commonly in fisheries despite this pressure, and has high survivorship when discarded, it is suspected that the Smallnose Fanskate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the  past   three generations (49.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Smallnose Fanskate occurs in the Southeast Pacific in the Strait of Magellan, Chile, and in the Southwest Atlantic from Santa Cruz, Argentina to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Menni and Stehmann 2000, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","This skate is taken as a utilized bycatch where caught, and is consumed   or sold locally or exported to Asia. In Argentina, skates were  discarded   until 1994, but are now one of the  most important  commercial species  (Chiaramonte 2014).  The wings are   removed and sold mainly to Asian  markets at high  prices (Dent and  Clarke 2015).",Marine,"This species is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the Environment No. 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Oddone <em>et al. </em>2018). This legislation came into force in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2017). This ordinance faces increasing industry pressure, including a court challenge to suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that the Brazilian National Red List was designed specifically for terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). The adequacy of enforcement is unknown. It is included in the annual maximum permitted catch (MPC) of  the  fishery for coastal skates in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone.  This measure is currently not likely to be an adequate management measure, because landings have been higher than the quotas.  In Argentina, the release of this species is mandatory inside the Punta Bermeja Natural Protected Area (slightly modified from Annex I, Legal Provision N. 999/2015 of the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development of Río Negro) (Venerus and Cedrola 2017). There are no known protections or conservation measures in place in the Chilean portion of its range. Further research is needed on life history, and population size and trend, and harvest management and species-specific monitoring should be undertaken in all commercial and artisanal fisheries to ensure that this species does not become threatened in the near future.","",,false,false,Global

Larger individuals are retained and juveniles tend to be discarded; post-release survival is unknown (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2020). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense and are unmanaged. Generally, catches have peaked and subsequently declined, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal fish species was introduced in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and a ban on industrial trawling went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Nevertheless, industrial fleets continue to fish with longlines and handline in Venezuela and also venture further afield to the Guianas and northern Brazil (Mendoza 2015). In Trinidad and Tobago, there were over 130 trawl vessels of various sizes operating off the west and south coasts of Trinidad, and over 1,000 artisanal vessels operating throughout the country in 2011 (Mohammed <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

There is also a   deepwater crustacean fishery operating between 280 and 474 m  (E. Acuña   unpubl. data 2019). Trawl and longline fisheries targeting  Chilean   Hake (<em>Merluccius australis</em>) operate there at depths of 50–300 m (Mateo <em>et al. </em>2019) and likely capture this skate. </p><p>In the Southwest Atlantic, the Multispine Skate is caught in otter trawls in southern Brazil where fishing pressure is intense and largely unmanaged (Rincon <em>et al</em>. 2017). From the late 1990s, deepwater fisheries along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil developed to remove some pressure from depleted coastal resources (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). These fisheries targeted a variety of species at depths of 200 m to greater than 1,000 m. Development of these fisheries was intense; the entire area fished for deepwater shrimp species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three-year period (2003–2006), reducing biomass estimates of the target species (<em>Aristaeopsis edwardsiana</em>) by up to 50% (Dallagnolo <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/></p><p>In Argentina, small numbers of this skate are captured in the Patagonian Scallop (<em>Zygochlamys patagonica</em>) fishery, which operates mostly along the 100 m isobath (Schejter <em>et al. </em>2012), and likely only interacts with the upper portion of this skate's depth range. In the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) target skate trawl fishery, which operates no deeper than about 400 m, this species is caught in low numbers (Winter <em>et al. </em>2015). Patagonian Toothfish fisheries there are likely to capture this species.<br/></p><p>Overall, this skate is captured in inadequately managed fisheries across its range, it may not be productive enough to withstand fishing pressure, and it has little if any refuge at depth. <br/></p><p></p>","There are no estimates of population size for this skate. Across its range, skates are typically not recorded or managed at the  species level. Species-specific catch time-series for Argentinian skate fisheries are  unavailable,  but overall skate landings were &lt;1,000 t prior to 1994,   rising to &gt;15,000 t in 2001, reaching a peak of 28,038 t in 2007  and dropping to 17,793 t in 2017 (G. Chiaramonte, unpubl. data 2019). In the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), species-specific  data re not available but landings of 'offshore skates' have only been  recorded since 2014 and have fluctuated between 2,000 and 4,500 t (CTMFM  2018). In the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) target skate fishery, this species showed an either stable or increasing trend in standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in a 1994–2013 time-series (Winter <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>Overall, due to the level of inadequately managed fisheries it is exposed to, general declines of skates in some parts of its range, and its lack of refuge at depth, balanced with the increase in CPUE in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), it is suspected that this skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generations (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Multispine Skate occurs in the Southeast Pacific Ocean from Coquimbo, Chile to Cape Horn (Bustamante <em>et al. </em>2014) and in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean from Santa Catarina, Brazil to Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)&#160;(Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","<p>In the Southwest Atlantic, skates larger than ~30 cm disc width are   typically utilized or exported for human consumption (Laptikhovsky  2004).

In Chile, the target skate fishery is regulated through reference points   and an annual total allowable catch (TAC) for the target Yellownose   Skate (70 t in 2018), with no further species-specific measures in place   (Mateo <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Chilean Hake fishery there is  certified by the  Marine Stewardship Council, however there are again no  species-specific  bycatch measures in place. Regulations and management  tools need to be  species-specific due to differing life histories and  abundance patterns  between the targeted species and other species  caught as bycatch such as  this.<br/><br/>In Argentina, there are theoretically total allowable catches (TACs), minimum sizes and overall  annual quotas for skates, however,  little attention is paid to these and there is no regular monitoring by  authorities. In the AUCFZ, it is managed with the group 'offshore skates' through a total allowable catch (CTMFM 2018). In  the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), vessels fishing under general finfish licences are prohibited from targeting skates,  although a small bycatch  (below 10%) is allowed. The target skate fishery there is managed, but not at the species level (Winter <em>et al. </em>2015). Further research is needed on life history,  population size and trend, and threats.

3124169,63157,Narcine brasiliensis,Near Threatened,A2d,2020,2019-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Lesser Numbfish (<em>Narcine brasiliensis</em>) is a small (to 45 cm total length) ray that occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from southern Brazil to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It is benthic on soft substrates of the continental shelf at depths of 6–60 m. It is captured in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal trawl and  beach seine fisheries throughout much of its geographic range. A population reduction is suspected from the peak and subsequent declines in reported ray landings from the Rio del Plata area. This species is  discarded when caught and discard survival rates are unknown, but are  suspected to be variable based on the injuries of  captured individuals. Although this ray is subject to high fishing pressure    across its range, it is still observed  commonly in fisheries despite this pressure. It is suspected that the Lesser Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the  past   three generations (26 years), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Lesser Numbfish is benthic on soft substrates of the continental shelf at 6–60 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~45 cm total length (TL); females mature at 32 cm TL and males at 28 cm TL (Rolim <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous, with an average litter size of 4 pups that are ~11 cm TL at birth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Nurseries are known to exist in Brazil off the northern coast of Santa Catarina State and the southern coast of Paraná state (Martins <em>et al. </em>2009). Generation length is suspected to be ~8.7 years, based on an age-at-maturity of 6.3 years and a maximum age of 11 years (F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018).","The Lesser Numbfish is captured in commercial and artisanal trawl and beach seine fisheries, which are intense and lack adequate management across much of its range. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense in Brazil, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are over-exploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels; this species made up nearly a third (28%) of the bycatch observed in the shrimp fishery at Perequê Beach between December 2014 and November 2015 (Rodrigues<em> et al.</em> 2019). In Uruguay, from where this species has rarely been recorded, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al. </em>2011, Lorenzo<em> et al.</em> 2015). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997, the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as many artisanal vessels are not registered. In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). Overall reported landings of rays from the Rio del Plata area increased from nearly zero in 1993 to a peak of over 8,000 t in 2009 but have since been declining (Cortes<em> et al. </em>2014). Survival rates when discarded are unknown, but are suspected to be variable based on data available regarding injuries of captured individuals. Chances of survival are likely to be higher when drag and soak times are reduced in trawl and net fisheries, respectively (Rodrigues<em> et al.</em> 2019). Whether this species' continued presence in landings is due to high survivorship or a productive enough life history to withstand fishing pressure (as a discard) requires further study.","Although the level of fishing pressure that this species is exposed to   across its range is high, it is still observed commonly in fisheries despite this pressure. It is therefore suspected that the Lesser Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past   three generations (26 years).",Decreasing,"The Lesser Numbfish occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from southern Brazil to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (G. Rincon unpubl. data 2018).","Like other electric rays, this species is typically discarded when caught.",Marine,"Annual spatial closures for shrimp trawling are in place in Brazil (IBAMA 2008), and these may benefit the Lesser Numbfish because they overlap in space with nursery areas and in time with the pupping season (Martins <em>et al. </em>2009). Further research is needed on life history and population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring of all  catches should be undertaken in commercial and artisanal fisheries.

3149565,908,Alosa alabamae,Near Threatened,A2ac,2021,2020-04-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Alosa alabamae </em>is a coastal, schooling, and anadromous species that returns to natal rivers to spawn. Historically, this species was very widely distributed throughout the coastal waters and associated rivers of the Gulf of Mexico. However, very little is known about this species within its marine range. As this is an anadromous species, it has been heavily impacted by habitat alteration and dam placement that prohibits it from reaching natal spawning grounds throughout its range. As a direct result, its global population has undergone declines in abundance compared to historical levels. Additionally, there are estimated declines in Area of Occupancy (AOO) approaching 30% over the most recent ten years available (2001 – 2010), thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths. More recent distribution information or population abundance estimates (2011 – 2020) are not available. Based on limited reports of successful threat mitigation throughout its range, it is inferred that the rate of decline in AOO has not changed. It is therefore suspected that the declines in the global population size have tracked closely with declines in AOO and are nearing 30%. This species’ relatively short generation length coupled with relatively recent Population Viability Analyses and recent reports of attempts to increase available spawning habitat (e.g., ‘conservation locking’, fish passages, etc.) in parts of its range indicates recovery from low population levels over time in the absence of threats may be possible. However, despite local information on conservation efforts and success using these mitigative techniques in parts of its range, no current evidence is available to suggest these initiatives are taking place on a wide enough scale to cause a drastic increase in spawning habitat availability at this time, despite urgency expressed by state managers and researchers dating back to at least the late 1990s. <em>Alosa alabamae</em>&#160;nearly meets the requirements for Vulnerable under criterion A2ac; therefore, it is conservatively assessed as Near Threatened. Additional conservation actions should be taken to mitigate current spawning restrictions and provide further access to suitable spawning habitats. Further research is urgently needed regarding this species' population abundance as it may in fact, qualify for a threatened category.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>This is an anadromous species that presumably spends much of its life schooling in coastal marine waters before migrating into natal rivers to spawn (Mickle<em> et al. </em>2015). It is known to a maximum standard length of 51 cm (Whitehead 1985).<em> </em>Little is known about its ecology when utilizing marine habitats (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), but it is thought that it primarily feeds in coastal marine waters (Mettee and O'Neil 2003) before migrating up into rivers during spring months (February – May: Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015). Kern <em>et al. </em>(2017) reports that upstream movement in the Lower Flint River, Georgia is greatest during April – mid-May. Juveniles reside in their natal drainage&#160;during&#160;the summer and fall and migrate to the Gulf of Mexico in late fall or winter (Barkuloo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Overall, the spawning habitat requirements of this species varies. Researchers support that this species spawns in shoal habitat downstream of the JWLD based on observations of the species congregating over the shoals during spawning season, as well as usage by other spawning anadromous species, such as the Gulf Sturgeon, <em>Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi</em> (NOAA 2017). In northwest Florida, spawning occurs in moderate currents over coarse sand and gravel (Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mills 1972). Adults selected limerock boulder substrate and used sandy substrate in the same proportion of its availability as preferred spawning grounds in the Lower Flint River, Georgia (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). Mettee <em>et al. </em>(1996) suspects that spawning occurs in late afternoon or at night. In Missouri, young have been captured in swift water about rock wing dikes in the Osage River and over rocky shoals with a noticeable current in the Gasconade River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). </p><p>  </p><p>Males reach sexual maturity between 1 to 5 years of age and females at 2 to 6 years in the Choctawhatchee River, Alabama and Florida (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Age-2 and -3 adults are the most prevalent age class of spawning adults and repeat spawning is common, but the percentage of returning spawners is highly variable among years&#160;(Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Given that it is known to have a maximum longevity of up to 6 years and females are known to reach maturity as early as two years (Mettee and O'Neil 2003), declines in population abundance and/or distribution should therefore be estimated over a time period of 10 years (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). </p><p></p>","<p></p><p>As this is an anadromous fish that requires an extensive spawning migration from coastal marine waters into natal rivers, the decline of this species’ global population and distribution is likely to be due to the<strong> </strong>modification and impoundment of riverine systems (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2011, NOAA 2017). Locks and dams built for navigation, hydroelectric generation, and flood control have effectively blocked migration routes to many historic upstream spawning areas for&#160;this species (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). High-lift navigation dams on the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers have blocked spawning migrations in the Mobile basin. Furthermore, streams have been degraded by siltation and pollution, and commercial and navigational dredging of sand bars has further degraded or eliminated some spawning habitats. Suspected threats to the remaining subpopulations in Alabama include increased sedimentation, pesticide runoff from agricultural operations, prolonged drought, and possible reservoir construction for water supply on major tributaries (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Additionally, NOAA (2017) suggests that low population abundance also poses a moderate threat to this species. This species is suspected to have been negatively impacted by threats within its marine distribution (Gulf of Mexico), possibly from impacts stemming from the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill, given the poor physiological condition and visible wounds/lesions present on the body of captured adults during spawning runs in the years following the oil spill and anecdotal evidence of other fish species with similar lesions; however, this cause is unconfirmed and the physiological condition improved in 2014 (Sammons 2014). In the past, harvesting in the Ohio River was considered a major threat to this species; however, no commercial harvest records exist after the early 1900s (<span class=""copy"">Hildenbrand 1963), and is no longer considered a threat. More research is urgently needed to determine the current (2011 – 2020) extent of suspected decline in abundance and estimated decline in available spawning habitat from these threats.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><strong>OVERALL POPULATION INFORMATION </strong></p>  <p>Limited population information is available for this species throughout its range and the total global adult population size is unknown; however, declines at least approaching 30% are suspected. Most of the species-specific information available is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF (Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint) river system are the only abundance estimates, either historic or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). General information presented below refer to the historic or current distribution of this species in river systems and are primarily based on capture data from multi-species surveys, project monitoring, incidental catches and anecdotal information (NOAA 2017). It is also known to migrate into the marine waters along the Gulf coast; however, little is known about this species within the marine environment, despite it spending a majority of its life there (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Overall, this species has declined, and in some cases, has been extirpated from large portions of its historical range (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). For example, it is suspected to have severely declined or may be extirpated from Iowa, Tennessee and Louisiana (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). It has been eliminated from much of its former inland distribution, especially in the Mobile Basin and the Mississippi River Valley (M. Warren 1999 pers. comm., Boschung and Mayden 2004); subpopulations are small and are now very rare throughout the entire Mississippi River basin (Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Robison and Buchanan 1988, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Pflieger 1997). It is considered rare or extirpated in much of its former range in Alabama (Boschung and Mayden 2004), including the upper Tombigbee, Cahaba, Coosa, and upper Alabama rivers (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). As of around 1990, abundance was evidently still declining in the Pearl River system of Louisiana and Mississippi (Gunning and Suttkus 1990), and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River. </p>  <p>Schaffler <em>et al. </em>(2015) reports that the Apalachicola River system has the largest extant subpopulation, but remnant subpopulations do occur in the Choctawhatchee River in Florida and Alabama, and the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. NOAA (2017) indicates this species was previously distributed within roughly 21 major river systems and associated tributaries at least throughout some time in history. It is estimated that ten out of the 21 known river systems still support spawning subpopulations (&lt;50%) with suitable, accessible habitat, and include the Apalachicola drainage, parts of the Mississippi, Missouri, Meramec, White, Ouachita, Pascagoula, Escambia (and Conecuh), Choctawhatchee and Suwannee rivers (NOAA 2017). It is suspected that this species' global population abundance has greatly diminished over the past 20 – 50 years range and is likely, or potentially extirpated from much of its former inland distribution where it has not been observed in many years, including the Ohio, Arkansas, Red, Illinois and Mary rivers, as well as the upper and lower Mississippi River mainstem (NOAA 2017). It is also considered rare or is sporadically recorded in parts of its range, such as in the Mobile Bay and Mobile River basin, Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa, Pearl, Ochlockonee and the Econfina rivers (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>As global population data are not available, the decline in population size was suspected based on the decline in AOO. Based on its distribution between 2001-2010, and the inference that the rate of decline has remained constant, it is suspected that the total global population size has declined by nearly 30%. Current distribution data as well as abundance data are urgently needed.</p>  <p><strong>RIVER/BASIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Apalachicola River Drainage:</strong></p>  <p>Most of the information regarding this species is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida where the largest subpopulation remains below the Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD). The ACF River system contains the largest spawning subpopulation of this species within its range, although the subpopulation may be several orders of magnitude<strong> </strong>smaller than historical levels (Sammons 2014, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Previously, researchers collected 141 Alabama shad in the Apalachicola in 1966 over the course of 17 sampling days using a variety of methods (Laurence and Yerger 1966), 251 were captured in 1969–1970 (Mills 1972) and 400 were captured from 1994 to 2000 in the Choctawhatchee River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). These relatively low catch rates suggest low abundances in previous years (Ely&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). </p>  <p>Apalachicola&#160;Alabama Shad exhibit low genetic diversity, which may inhibit its ability to respond to unanticipated environmental and anthropogenic changes (Moyer 2012). Smith&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2011) conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) of Alabama Shad in the Apalachicola River System and predicted that the subpopulation was increasing and could reach carrying capacity in about 40 years given the conditions remain favourable (e.g., allowing passage of spawning adults through the dam). However, this subpopulation declined rapidly after 2013 from unknown causes and has remained at a low level (S. Sammons pers. comm. April 2020).</p>  <p>Despite apparent declines in global population size over time, the subpopulation of this species within the ACF River system has remained self-sustaining and therefore, a project to restore passage to upstream spawning habitats has been initiated (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015). Cooperative studies supported by many local, academic, state, and federal partners have started tracking the movements of this species in 2005 in the Apalachicola River (USFWS 2008, Ely <em>et al. </em>2008, TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). Results of this collaborative study showed that the existing lock at JWLD could be operated to allow movement upriver and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ to provide this species with upstream access (NOAA 2017). Abundance of this species prior to 2005, including prior to the installation of the dam, were never estimated (Ely&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), but these improvements in facilitating fish passage is thought to have allowed recruitment to increase in recent years (Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Schaffler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and are expected to be a major component of the future restoration of this species in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p>  <p>Adult subpopulation estimates (spring), adult CPUE (spring) and juvenile CPUE (fall) are available for this species in the ACF River system between 2005 – 2016 and are based on mark-recapture methods (NOAA 2017). Adult subpopulation estimates show high variability (approximately 122,500 individuals estimated in 2012, compared to 300 and 0 individuals estimated in 2015 and 2016, respectively) during this time series but are based on whether ‘conservation locking’ took place (NOAA 2017). During periods of ‘conservation locking’ this species was successfully able to pass upstream and yield higher subpopulation estimates overall indicating better recruitment (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017). However, in the years where ‘conservation locking’ did not take place due to lock maintenance and upgrades (2013 and 2014) and in the years directly after (2015 and 2016), adult subpopulation estimates were low (i.e., below 2,000 individuals). Spawning subpopulation size estimates were attempted in the Apalachicola River in 2014; however, too few individuals were collected to allow for a subpopulation estimate (Sammons 2014). More recently, egg collection for this species was more successful than larvae collection, but still much lower than that of the similar American Shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) and it is possible that the low efficiency resulted from low densities of adults, as few adult individuals were collected below JWLD in 2017 (Sammons 2018). </p>  <p>Spawning individuals are now able to access over 150 miles (241.4 km) of necessary historical habitat and spawning areas in the ACF River system for the first time in over 50 years now that the JWLD lock operates within their natural spawning cues (TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). ‘Conservation locking’ is thought to be making a tremendous impact on this species within the ACF River system; adults are most commonly found in the Flint River arm of Lake Seminole above the JWLD (Sammons 2013, Sammons 2014) and juveniles are likely able to move downstream to contribute to the adult stock (NOAA 2017). Despite the enhancement of spawning and recruitment of this species due to ‘conservation locking’ (Young 2010, 2011, Sammons and Young 2012, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017), and although the ACF River system has had the largest known subpopulation of this species for decades, the lack of ‘conservation locking’ in 2013 and 2014 due to maintenance, combined with environmental conditions (cold and flooding) and poor condition of spawning adults (unexplained visible wounds) probably produced the weakest year class since research began on this species in 2005 (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>Temperature is one of the main cues for this species to enter the ACF River system to spawn (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). The unusually low water temperatures in 2013 and 2014 may have hindered the usual spawning cues for this species resulting in a limited number of fish migrating upstream (Sammons 2014). High water and discharge during this time may have also hindered catch rates, but more likely spawning subpopulation size was very low (Sammons 2014).</p>  <p>Differences in the trends of the adult subpopulation of this species can be partially explained by differing sampling effort due to environmental conditions and funding levels; however, researchers suspect the spawning subpopulation in the ACF River system in 2013 – 2016 was dangerously low compared to the 2009 – 2012 spawning subpopulations (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). Access to the more than 150 miles of spawning habitat for this species above Lake Seminole through ‘conservation locking’ appears to be necessary to increase the current low population levels. </p>  <p>Similar to other Clupeids, this species exhibits natural variability, and given that there are no historic estimates to compare to recent populations trends, it is very difficult to interpret population trends for this species (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF River system are the only abundance estimates for this species throughout its global range, either historical or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Mississippi River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically found in several parts of the Mississippi River and its tributaries (NOAA 2017). For example, it was known as far north as Keokuk, Iowa (Coker 1930), the Ohio River at Louisville (Evermann 1902) and eastern Oklahoma (Moore 1957, Miller and Robison 2004). Despite sporadic observations of this species and reports of depletion in the basin (e.g., Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Page and Burr 1991), several small spawning subpopulations remain (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Upper Mississippi River Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Upper Mississippi River is the portion upstream of Cairo, Illinois. This species was recorded in a 1994 annual status report as being captured in a long-term resource monitoring program (Grutreuter <em>et al. </em>1997); however, no species data (i.e., number caught, gear used, location, etc.) were reported. Currently, there are 10 locks or dams on the Upper Mississippi River that border the state of Iowa and an addition seven locks and dams south of Iowa which likely prevent this species from reaching historical spawning grounds (Steuck <em>et al. </em>2010). Iowa DNR has not collected this species in the Upper Mississippi River in more than 25 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), and no recent information is available to suggest otherwise between the year 2011 and present day (2020). </p>  <p><strong>Missouri River:</strong></p>  <p>The Missouri Fish and Wildlife Information System maintained by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) states that this species spawns in the Missouri River and two of its tributaries, the Gasconade and Osage Rivers (MDC 2015). Galat (2005) reported the presence of this species in the lower Missouri River in 2005 and stated that it is rare in the Ozark Plateaus region in southern Missouri. The MDC reported this species has been captured in the Missouri River at least up until 2012 in multi-species surveys (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p><strong>Meramec River:</strong></p>  <p>Burr <em>et al. </em>(2004) and Buchannan <em>et al. </em>(2012) list the Meramec River as one of the remaining spawning rivers of this species in Missouri and is supported by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC 2015). </p>  <p><strong>Lower Mississippi Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Lower Mississippi River (south of Cairo, Illinois) used to provide a means for this species to reach many of its tributaries; however, no individuals have been found in the lower portion of the waterway in recent years in annual fish surveys conducted by USGS (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011, NOAA 2017).&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Ohio River:</strong></p>  <p>This species used to be present and abundant enough to support a small commercial fishery in the Ohio River during the late 19<sup>th</sup> century; however, by 1989, this species was extirpated from this river (Pearson and Pearson 1989). It has not been collected or observed from this river or the Tennessee River since the early 1990s (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Arkansas River:</strong></p>  <p>No records of this species exist from the Arkansas River since the 1890s; however, few individuals may have been captured from its tributaries in the 1950s, but this is unclear (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>1983). This species may have been extirpated from the watershed due to dams (NOAA 2017). In a two-year intensive field sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers, special emphasis was placed on sampling in the Ouachita and Arkansas rivers in 2019; however, conditions were not suitable for safe and effective fish sampling due to excessive flooding, therefore sampling did not take place in the Arkansas River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). In 2020, sampling was conducted in the Arkansas River below the four most downstream dams, but no individuals were collected (Eggleton pers comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020).</p>  <p><strong>Red River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has not been collected from the Red River or its tributaries since around the 1980s (e.g., Matthews and Robison 1988, Buchannan <em>et al. </em>2003, Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>Illinois and Marys Rivers:</strong></p>  <p>There are historical records of this species within the Illinois rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011); however, the abundance is not known (NOAA 2017). This species appears to have been extirpated from many Illinois rivers and are considered rare in the state (NOAA 2017). Annual field studies have yielded no additional records of this species (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>White River:</strong></p>  <p>The White River (Arkansas) is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River. Three juveniles were collected from the White River in 2006, which confirms there is probably a small spawning subpopulation (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>2012). In an ongoing two-year sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers (2019 – 2020: Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019), three reaches of the White River were sampled for this species in 2020 and resulted in zero collected individuals (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Ouachita River:</strong></p>  <p>The Ouachita River is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River and includes the Little Missouri and Saline Rivers. This species is rare in Arkansas rivers overall and only a handful of adults have ever been collected; however, most individuals (adult and juvenile) have been taken from the middle Ouachita River and its largest tributary, the Little Missouri River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Ouachita and Little Missouri Rivers are thought to contain very small spawning subpopulations of this species given that a majority of the 767 individuals ever collected (since 1879) were juveniles, and may represent the limit of their inland spawning migrations (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). There have been no recent reports of this species in the Saline River (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>1999); only a single specimen was collected in 1972 (Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019). An ongoing, two-year sampling study (2019 – 2020) of this species in the Ouachita River basin represents one of the most intensive efforts ever made to collect this species in Arkansas, but has yielded only a single adult male specimen and zero juveniles (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although it is likely this species was present in the Ouachita basin in 2019, severe hydrological conditions (e.g., excessive flooding) during the likely spawning window limited the ability for researchers to collect data on this species (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p><strong>Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa River:</strong></p>  <p>This species is caught sporadically within Louisiana, but data are limited within its rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Pearl River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has been reported in low numbers from the Pearl River in multi-species studies; however, this may be due to limited sampling effort during spawning periods (NOAA 2017). Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported no individuals have been captured since the 1990s and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River, but museum records attained by Tulane University in 2004 suggests otherwise (FishNet2 portal accessed March 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Pascagoula River:</strong></p>  <p>This Pascagoula River system (Pascagoula, Leaf and Chickasawhay Rivers) is the only system within the state of Mississippi inhabited by this species (Mickle <em>et al. </em>2010, Mickle 2010, NOAA 2017) and has one of the remaining spawning subpopulations of this species (Mickle 2006).<strong> </strong></p>  <p><strong>Mobile Bay and the Mobile River Basin:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically prevalent in the Mobile River basin (Evermann and Kendall 1897) and some studies suggest that subpopulations persist (e.g., Boschung and Mayden 2004, Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004); however, few individuals have been captured throughout the basin in recent years (NOAA 2017). For example, the most recent Mobile Basin records are limited to&#160;single adult individuals collected in the Black Warrior River in 1998 (the first record from that river in more than 100 years) and in the Alabama River in 1993 and 1995 (Mettee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015). No Alabama Shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015). </p>  <p><strong>Escambia River and Conecuh River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically documented in the Escambia and Conecuh Rivers as early as 1900 (Evermann and Kendall 1900) and contains one of the known remaining spawning subpopulations (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Mettee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Choctawhatchee River:</strong></p>  <p>Some studies indicate there are small spawning subpopulations of this species in southern Alabama including the Choctawhatchee and Pea Rivers (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Barkuloo <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993, Mettee <em>et al. </em>1996, Adams <em>et al. </em>2000, Mettee and O’Neil 2003, Young 2010). </p>  <p><strong>Ochlockonee River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically present in the Ochlockonee River between Georgia and Florida (NOAA 2017). Few specimens have been taken from this river since the late 1970s (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Econfina River:</strong></p>  <p>Historical data for this species are not available from the Ecofina River, but a single individual was captured here in 2006 (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Suwannee River:</strong></p>  <p>Historically, the Suwannee River has been the easternmost boundary of this species’ range (Herald and Strickland 1946) and Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reports that there is still a spawning subpopulation in the river. However, more recent information is unavailable.</p><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>This species was historically widely distributed throughout coastal waters and river systems along the Gulf of Mexico off the United States and eastern Oklahoma in the Ouachita River system, east to the Mississippi River and the Suwannee River in Florida (Coker 1930, Lee <em>et al. </em>1980, Pattillo <em>et al. </em>1997, Kern <em>et al. </em>2017, NOAA 2017). It was known to reach freshwater rivers as far inland as Oklahoma, Iowa and West Virginia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). According to Mickle&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010), the range of this species has contracted to only the Pascagoula River drainage in Mississippi; however, Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2012) documents the existence of a reproducing population in the Apalachicola River in Florida and Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported the present distribution extends up the Mississippi River drainage into eastern Arkansas and central Missouri. </p><p>NOAA (2013, 2017) recognizes the current freshwater range of this species to include the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint (ACF) River system above Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in Florida/Georgia/Alabama, the Pea and Choctawhatchee rivers in Alabama, the Pearl River in Louisiana/Mississippi, and the Little Missouri River in Arkansas as reported by Smith&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011). Limited information is available about its distribution in marine waters. The depth range of this species is unknown; however, similar to other closely related species, it probably occupies depths between 0–50 metres.</p><p>    </p><p>As spawning occurs in riverine environments, its freshwater extent was used to determine the area of occupancy (AOO), calculated from a 4 km² grid, and extent of occurrence (EOO), based on a minimum convex polygon. Based on the rivers where this species was distributed in 2001 and 2010 (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), the AOO declined by from 8,816 km² in 2001 to 6,576 km² in 2010 and the EOO declined by from 897,311 km² in 2001 and 341,562 km² in 2010. Although more recent distribution data are not available, the rate of decline in AOO was inferred to have remained constant over the last 10 years. Therefore, we extrapolated the data to the present using an exponential regression, which results in an inferred decline in AOO of 27.8%.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Alabama Shad were harvested for food from the Ohio River in Indiana and Kentucky, several rivers in Alabama, and the Ouachita River in Arkansas in the 1800s (Mettee and O'Neil 2003). Formerly, commercial fishing in the Ohio River amounted to several thousand pounds harvested per year and was considered a major threat to this species<span class=""copy"">. Commercial landings of this species were reported at 3,165 kg in 1889 and 48 kg in 1902 (Hildenbrand 1963). It&#160;disappeared from fishery statistics in the early 1900s and commercial landings have not been reported since (Hildenbrand 1963), possibly due to the construction of high lift locks and dams that blocked upstream migrations (Mettee and O'Neil 2003).<span class=""copy""></span></p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>This species is listed on the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Species of Concern List (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011) and has been petitioned to be included as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA: NOAA 2017). Despite being listed as a Species of Concern, this status does not carry any procedural or substantive federal protections (NOAA 2017). An overall paucity of available data regarding the life history and abundance of this species has ultimately prevented it from receiving more urgent conservation efforts based on the criteria used for the ESA (Grice <em>et al. </em>2014, NOAA 2017). Regardless of the lack of federal protection, it is protected by some states where it is currently, or was previously distributed (Meadows <em>et al. </em>2008, Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017, Eggleton <em>et al. </em>2019), as many have enacted recovery and conservation plans in response to river-wide declines.</p><p>State and Federal agencies are working with conservation groups and researchers to restore passage of Alabama Shad to their historic range upstream of Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in the Apalachicola basin. In 2008, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ by operating the lock at JWLD to provide Alabama shad access to upstream habitat (NOAA 2013). Subpopulation increases have been documented upon the strategic opening of a navigation lock on the Jim Woodruff dam by maximizing attraction flow near the lock entrance and increasing the time the upper gates are open during an afternoon locking cycle to&#160;allow fish to pass to spawning grounds (Young&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Efforts to pass shad through the lock have resulted in the passage of shad through Lake Seminole and into the Chattahoochee and Flint River systems in Georgia. These efforts are expected to continue to be a major component supporting the restoration of this species in the ACF River system (Kern and Sammons 2015). </p><p>The translocation of adults and supplemental stocking of juvenile fish from the ACF river system has been attempted in the past in Georgia with some success (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020); however, adults transported into the Alabama River showed with little success due to a low number of individuals at the JWLD lock (Kern and Sammons 2015). Approximately 10,000 fry in 2013 and 102,000 fry in 2017 were stocked in the upper Flint River above Lake Blackshear that were spawned from adults captured below the JWLD; however, stock contribution was never evaluated (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In 2012, roughly 100 adults captured below the JWLD were transported into to Lake Blackshear; young of the year were captured in fall gillnetting samples, thus indicating successful spawning of stocked adults (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In Alabama, adult individuals were captured below the JWLD in 2014 and 2015 and transported into the Alabama River to establish and annual spawning run; however, no Alabama shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015). If numbers of this species increase in the future at the JWLD, it is likely that this method will be attempted again in Georgia and Alabama, as it may be one of the only ways to reintroduce this species into the mobile drainage (Kern and Sammons 2015, S. Sammons pers. comm. May 2020).</p><p>In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015). No Alabama Shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p><p>Research into effective fish passages, restoration of hydrologic regimes, migrations, feeding, bycatch, spawning, rearing, and other habitat needs should be carried out (Meadows&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Spawning habitats require protection and/or restoration, including maintaining flow regimes that would allow for large sandbars and preserve accumulation of large woody debris along steep riverbanks and enabling effective passage for fish throughout watershed&#160;drainages (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Buchanan<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). The variation in year-class strength typical to this genus suggests that subpopulations of Alabama shad can recover quickly to historic levels under favorable conditions (Ely<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2008). The majority of the&#160;subpopulation in the Apalachicola River system is dependent upon access to spawning in the Flint River; therefore, priorities to maintain the connectivity of this waterway are essential (Schaffler<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2015). Additionally, efforts to provide passage at other upstream barriers should be examined for the expansion of restoration efforts of this species (Sammons 2014), similar to efforts initiated at the JWLD. </p><p>            Subpopulations could increase if favorable environmental conditions are restored throughout its current range and recovery may be high in parts of its range with unimpounded systems and where management actions have already allowed for upstream passage for spawning runs. Beyond this, there is a need for studies focused on the adult life stage in marine and estuarine environments (Sammons 2014, Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Mettee and O'Neil (2003) recommend research on its distribution, spawning season variation, population size, fecundity, diet, and movements in the Mississippi River and its major tributaries and in Gulf Coast drainages containing known subpopulations. Future studies should also focus on potential environmental and biological mechanisms that may govern spawning stock size and survival (Sammons 2014).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,"Global, Caribbean & Gulf of Mexico"

5481210,161691,Raja brachyura,Near Threatened,,2009,2008-12-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blonde Ray (<em>Raja brachyura</em>) is a relatively large-bodied skate, endemic to the northeast Atlantic and western Mediterranean Sea. Occurs on soft substrates to depths of about 150 m in the northeast Atlantic and mainly from 10-300 m depth in the Mediterranean Sea. Targeted in areas where it is locally abundant and taken as bycatch in mixed demersal fisheries using trawl, gill nets and longlines elsewhere in its range. It is apparently rare in the Mediterranean Sea, captured in only 21 of 6,336 tows in Mediterranean-wide trawl surveys conducted between 1994-1999 (at depths of 10-800 m). It is not certain whether the Blonde Ray has always been rare there; no data are currently available on historical abundance or trends for this region and there is no evidence to suggest it was ever common. The lack of data on this apparently rare species prevents an assessment beyond Data Deficient in the Mediterranean Sea at present, but given that demersal fishing pressure is relatively intense throughout large areas of its range there an assessment of catches is a priority. This species is more common in the northeast Atlantic where it is taken as bycatch and also targeted where sufficiently abundant. No formal stock assessments have been undertaken for this species. Although it is locally abundant in some areas, survey data indicate that declines have occurred. Medium sized skates showed marked declines in relative abundance, especially the Blonde Ray, in comparable research trawl surveys conducted in three locations around the British Isles in 1901-1907 and 1989-1997. Furthermore, the percentage composition of the Blonde Ray decreased by close to 30% between the two survey periods. Demersal fishing pressure is still high throughout large areas of the Northeast Atlantic and declines are inferred elsewhere, where specific data are not available. This species probably has limiting life-history characteristics, like other relatively large skates, making it vulnerable to depletion. Given observed and inferred declines, continued high levels of exploitation and this species' rarity in the Mediterranean Sea, it just fails to meet the criteria for Vulnerable A2bd globally and is assessed as Near Threatened. Improved monitoring of population trends and further assessment of the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations are a priority.","<em>Raja brachyura</em> is most common on sandy sediments in waters down to about 150 m deep (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005a) in the Northeast Atlantic, though may occur deeper in the southern parts of its range. In the Mediterranean Sea it is mainly found at depths of 10-150 m to about 300 m (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001). It reaches a maximum size of ~120 cm (TL) (Stehmann and Burkel 1984) and commonly reaches 40-80 cm TL. Like other skates, reproduction is oviparous. They reproduce from February to August and have a gestation period of almost seven months, with females producing about 30 egg cases/year (measuring about 12 x 8 cm, excluding horns) (Stehmann and Burkel 1984). Juveniles feed on small crustaceans (amphipods, natantids), with larger individuals more piscivorous and predating on dragonet and sand eels (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996). Little is known about its reproductive biology.","<strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>Taken in targeted fisheries in areas where it is locally abundant and taken as a bycatch in mixed demersal fisheries elsewhere in its range. Also taken in recreational fisheries. Skates are an important component of demersal fisheries in the northeast Atlantic and <em>Raja brachyura</em> is landed and sold (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Holden 1977). This species is one of the more frequent species landed by the commercial fleet on the Portuguese cost, accounting for 44% of the total individuals sampled in Peniche and 18% in Matosinhos (Machado <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>The blond ray is caught as part of the bycatch of the semi industrial (Spain) and artisanal (Morocco and Greece) fisheries with bottom trawls, gill nets and long lines (Bauchot 1987). Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was historically exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp). Later effort increased to a total nominal horse power of 19,940 hp (1974 to 1987).  The continental shelf and upper slope of the Mediterranean Sea are highly exploited, with intensive commercial trawling occurring at depths ranging from 50 to 700 to 800 m (Colloca <em>et al.</em> 2003, Massuti and Moranta 2003).","<strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>It is relatively common in the inshore and shelf waters (down to about 150 m) in the English Channel and Irish Sea, Bristol Channel and St George's Channel (Fahy 1989, 1991; Ellis <em>et al. </em>2005a). It is less abundant in the North Sea and Celtic Sea (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005a). Blonde ray is also one of the more important ray species recorded in landings around the Iberian Peninsula (ICES 2006).<br/><br/>No formal stock assessments have been undertaken for this species. Although it has a relatively broad geographical range, this species is most abundant from the British Isles to Portugal. There are certain areas where it is locally abundant, for example in parts of the North Sea and Irish Sea. Hence, this species seems to have a fragmented population, possibly due to the fragmented nature of its favoured habitat. This species may have declined over the course of the 20th century (Rogers and Ellis 2000). Rogers and Ellis (2000) compared standardized catch rates of demersal fish from research vessel surveys in three areas around the British Isles (northwestern Irish Sea, Devon, and southern North Sea) from 1901 to 1907 with survey catches in the same areas from 1989-1997. In this analysis, skates of intermediate body size showed marked declines in relative abundance, especially the blonde ray <em>R. brachyura</em> and the thornbach ray <em>R. clavata</em>. Furthermore, the percentage composition of the blonde ray decreased by close to 30% between the two survey periods. Catch rates in beam trawl surveys in the English Channel and Irish Sea appear steady in recent times (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005b), and there is no consistent trend in the North Sea (ICES 2006). However, these catch rates refer to all individuals and not just mature fish.<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>The blonde ray <em>Raja brachyura</em>, is relatively rare in the Mediterranean. It is not certain if it has always been rare there. The species is rare but consistently caught in the MEDITS trawl surveys from 1994 to 1999. The MEDITS survey covers the north Mediterranean coast almost continuously from west Morocco and Spain in the west Mediterranean to the Aegean Sea in the eastern Mediterranean (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Six trawl surveys are carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and the Eastern (Aegean Sea).

It marketed mostly frozen, sometimes fresh. The observed distribution of several large pelagic predators, including the striped marlin, has significantly contracted from the 1960s to 2000 (Worm and Tittensor 2011).<br/><br/>In the western central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), catches of Striped Marlin were dominated by the Japanese longline fleet until the early 1990s. Taiwanese and Korean fleets have reported relatively small catches of Striped Marlin since the mid 1960s and mid 1970s, respectively. However, Taiwanese catches have increased in recent years, mainly due to the high effort of this fleet in the eastern temperate WCPO, targeting mainly Albacore Tuna. Longline fleets of Pacific Island Countries and Territories, and by Australia and New Zealand, have reported increasing catches since the early 1990s mainly due to the development of these domestic fleets. Catches by Australian longline fleets have rapidly increased in recent years due, at least in part, to specific targeting of striped marlin by some vessels during some periods. Since 1987, longline fleets operating in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have been prohibited from landing Striped Marlin in an attempt support recreational fisheries in the north of the country (Kopf 2005). Extensive recreational fisheries exist throughout the southwest Pacific Ocean (Whitelaw 2001, Bromhead <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Kopf 2005) although total catches by recreational fisheries are very small relative to commercial catches.

However, studies into the survival of recreationally captured marlin have estimated that between 0–50% of marlin suffer post-release mortality due to hook damage, stress or increased susceptibility to predation (Pepperell and Davis 1999), although studies are rare, sample sizes are typically small and the durations of monitoring of post-released fish are relatively short (e.g., maximum of 93 days for Striped Marlin, Domeier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/>Fishing in the tropical eastern Pacific region is by both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Striped Marlin are caught mostly by the longline fisheries of Far East and Western Hemisphere national. Lesser numbers are caught by recreational, gillnet and other fisheries. This species may be threatened by the expansion of long line fisheries and also increased artisanal fisheries in the tropical eastern Pacific region.","McDowell and Graves (2008) indicate that there are four stocks of this species: one centred in Hawaii, one in Australia and New Zealand, and two in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

Over a three generation length period (1992–2008), the population decline was calculated to be 0% as the spawning biomass has been increasing since 2003 (Figure 5.2.3.1, Hinton and Maunder 2011).

It is likely that declines are in the order of 40–50% for the Northwest Pacific (Hinton pers. comm. 2011).

An average of these two declines was used to characterize the population in the Indian Ocean, however these data are limited and catch data from other industrial fisheries such as longliners of Indonesia and Philippines are not available. The stock is not considered to be well managed and more information is needed to understand population declines for Striped Marlin in the Indian Ocean.",Decreasing,"This species is widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters of the Indo-Pacific and strays are occasionally found in the southeastern Atlantic.

The central equatorial region in the western and central Pacific is characterized by very low and intermittent hook rate for Striped Marlin, and thus is not considered part of their normal distribution (Ueyanagi and Wares 1975).<br/><br/>According to early longlining data, the areas of highest abundance were in the central north and the eastern Pacific, while the waters of the south and western Pacific were areas of lesser abundance (Ueyanagi and Wares 1975). In the south and southwest Pacific, adults are most abundant during the spring and summer and least abundant in the winter. This region includes eastern Australian, where striped marlin are present from the Coral Sea to Tasmania (depending on currents and seasons).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific the distribution stretches from California to the southwestern and central eastern Gulf of California to Peru, including all of the oceanic islands.",This is an important commercial and recreational species.,Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In the Western Central Pacific, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) is tasked to undertake precautionary measures that will not permit increases in fishing mortality until the estimates of stock status are more certain.

Several sub-regional stock assessment in the Western Indian Ocean report this species to be heavily overexploited, with some estimates of fishing mortality in the Arabian Gulf between two and four times over the optimum. In India, its current exploitation rate is estimated to be 60% over the optimum. In the Torres Strait, this species biomass has declined at least 40–50% since the 1980s, and has declined at least 40% in eastern Australia. In Queensland, management authorities determined this species to be overfished, and the fishery may be in danger of collapsing. Where data are available to conduct a quantitative stock assessment, results have shown at least a 30% decline in biomass or other indicators of population abundance over the past 25–40 years. However, there is little information on stocks of this species in East Africa, southeast Asia and in the northeastern portion of its range. Consequently, this species is listed as Near Threatened. With additional information from these regions this species may warrant reassessment.","This species is pelagic and oceanodromous. It is distributed from near the edge of the continental shelf to shallow coastal waters, often of low salinity and high turbidity. It is also found in drop-offs, and shallow or gently sloping reef and lagoon waters. It inhabits coastal waters at depths to 200 m (Collette 2001), but is more frequently caught in areas less than 100 m depth. It usually hunts solitarily and often swims in shallow water along coastal slopes. It is known to undertake lengthy long-shore migrations, but permanent resident populations also seem to exist. It is found in small schools. It feeds primarily on small fishes like anchovies, clupeids, carangids, also squid, and penaeid shrimps.<br/><br/>Depending on temperature regime, the spawning season may be more or less extended. In Australian waters, each female spawns several times over the season, about two to six days apart, depending on the locality. Spanish Mackerel spawn off the reef slopes and edges, and they form spawning aggregations in specific areas.<br/><br/>This species has an age at first maturity of about two years (Devaraj 1981, Grandcourt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005, Mackie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Claereboudt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In north Queensland, Australia the oldest male was 10 years (127 cm, 19.0 kg), and the oldest female 14 years (155 cm, 35 kg). This species may live up to 15 years (IOTC 2006), 16 years (Grandcourt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005), and maybe as long as 22 years (Mackie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).

This species is also taken as bycatch in long-line, purse-seine and gill net gear targeting larger scombrids.<br/><br/>A lipid-soluble toxin, similar to ciguatoxin has been found in the flesh of specimens caught on the east coast of Queensland, Australia.  <br/><br/>This species is considered to be under intense fishing pressure in Oman, and urgent management is recommended (Claereboudt<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2005).","This species is taken throughout its range by commercial, artisanal, and recreational fisheries. Worldwide reported landings show a gradual increase from 7,186 tonnes in 1950 to 23,5985 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>The species comprises at least two stocks in the Indo-Pacific separated by the Wallace Line (Suleman and Ovender 2010).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean</span><br/>Catch estimates for Narrow-barred Spanish Mackerel are highly uncertain. The catches of Spanish Mackerel increased from around 50,000 t the mid-1970s to 100,000 t by the mid-1990s. The current average annual catch is around 112,200 t (for the period 2002 to 2006), with most of the catch obtained taken from the west Indian Ocean area. In recent years, the countries attributed with the highest catches of Spanish Mackerel are Indonesia, Madagascar, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The overall catch in the eastern Indian Ocean is relatively stable, whereas in the western Indian Ocean it peaked in 1988 and has levelled off since then (IOTC 2006).<br/><br/>Some localized, sub-regional assessments have been carried out (Ben Meriem <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Devaraj <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Motlagh and Shojaei 2009), but none at a regional level. In the Persian Gulf, catch increased from 3,939 t in 1997 to 8,149 t in 2003 mostly from gillnets but also handlines, and this species is considered to be heavily overexploited (Motlagh and Shojaei 2009, Shojaei <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In Oman, it is estimated that at the current fishing mortality rate of 16% for females and 27% for males, the fishery is overfished with a high chance of recruitment failure in the near future (Govender <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Similarly, in the Arabian Sea, the fishing mortality rate greater than four times the optimum, and the resource is heavily exploited (Grandcourt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).

An earlier assessment for the eastern Australia stock estimated biomass declines to be approximately 33–63% from 1992 to 2002 (within three generation lengths). In the most recent (2009–2010) stock assessment, it was recorded as sustainably fished with total mortality estimates indicating fishing is occurring at upper levels (SS&#160; 2011). Estimates are not available for the remaining portion of its range. Early declines in catch and the lack of information on the stock structure and fisheries in the northern and western portion of this species range indicate that the status of this species should be carefully watched. Currently it is listed as Near Threatened instead of Vulnerable as recommended by Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011).<br/></p>","This species is pelagic, oceanodromous, and found more commonly in offshore, open waters away from reefs and shoals. It forms large schools which move close inshore along the coast of Queensland, where it is commonly taken between December and April or May. It feeds largely on fishes, particularly anchovies and sardines, with smaller quantities of shrimps and squids (Begg and Hopper 1997). Common fork length ranges 50–80 cm.<br/><br/>Spotted Mackerel spawn between August and October in northern Queensland waters with peak spawning occurring in September (Begg 1998). They grow quickly for the first three years of life, and demonstrate sex-specific growth rates, with females tending to grow faster and to larger sizes (Begg and Sellin 1998). Considerable variation in length is found for any given age of Spotted Mackerel, where they have been aged up to seven years and observed to 105 cm total length (TL) and 7.4 kg. Female and male Spotted Mackerel reach maturity at about 60 cm and 52 cm TL, respectively, within 1–2 years of age (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). Generation length is estimated to be between 3–4 years.<br/><br/>Tagged Spotted Mackerel move long distances, with about 39% recaptured over 100 km from the release site (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997). The longest movement was 1,100 km over 228 days. These movements, together with spatial and temporal patterns of tagging effort and commercial fishing harvest, indicate a single eastern stock that undertakes a seasonal migration associated with spawning and feeding along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997, Staunton-Smith <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>The all-tackle angling record is of a 9.25 kg fish caught off South West Rocks, New South Wales, Australia in 1987 (IGFA 2011).","<p>This is an important species for recreational and commercial fishers in Queensland, Australia. It was a major part of the set gillnet and ring-net commercial fisheries (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>.1998), but since 2004 it has been predominantly a line-fished species. The highly aggregated, near-surface schooling behaviour of the stock coupled with its predictable seasonal movements along the east coast allows ease of targeting by both the commercial and recreational sectors; thereby making the stock susceptible to over-fishing. In 1999–2000, commercial catches of Spotted Mackerel increased significantly in response to the development of valuable overseas export markets. The 2009–10 SS and ASR reports that the east coast harvest was 100 tons of commercial catch (12 t net and 88 t line), 11 t of charter and 305 t recreational (A. Garland, pers. comm. 2011). The Gulf of Carpentaria commercial sector has not reported any harvest since 2008 (the catch between 2003 and 2008 was less than 400 t).<br/>&#160;<br/>Indications from the earlier assessment, besides the relatively flat CPUE time series, suggest that the eastern Spotted Mackerel stock was most likely being harvested near or exceeding maximum sustainable levels, and was at risk of being over-fished (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In the 2009–2010 stock assessment, it was recorded as sustainably fished with the justification of a predominantly line fished species since 2004 (SS 2011).</p>","A stock assessment (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005) for this species' population off the Australian east coast (northern Queensland to northern New South Wales), based on data from 1960–2002, showed 2002 biomass levels to be between 33% and 63% of pre-1960 unfished or virgin biomass levels. This assessment indicated that the estimated 2002 biomass was above BMSY. Model projections suggest catches of greater than 300–350 tonnes in 2003 have a high risk of reducing the population in relation to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Annual landings in 2009–2010 reached 71% of the total allowable catch (TAC) (ASR 2011).<br/><br/>This Queensland stock in 2004 was considered fully fished, with commercial landings of 60–120 t and a recreational catch of about 150 t (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). Commercial landings in New South Wales have fluctuated, and averaged around 20–30 t between 1990 and 2009, with a high of 60 t in 2000 and a low of around 10 t in 2009. However, catches are not considered a robust indicator of abundance (Queensland Fisheries 2010).<br/><br/>There is no information available for the remaining parts of this species' range. This may be because the Queensland portion of the range represents the most important part of the fishery.",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the northern coast of Australia, from the Abrolhos Islands region of Western Australia to Coffs Harbour and Kempsey in central New South Wales; also occurring in southern Papua New Guinea from Kerema to Port Moresby.",This is a commercial species in Australia.,Marine,"More information is needed to determine the status of the western population, and if the assessment conducted on the East coast are inclusive.<br/><br/>There are bag and size limits for this species. The Queensland Fishery is regulated under Queensland's Fisheries Regulations 1995. In response to concerns about sustainability, some major changes in management were made in 2002 and 2003 that apply to both commercial and recreational fishers (Staunton-Smith <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). The minimum legal size was increased from 50 to 60 cm total length, the recreational bag limit was reduced from 30 to five fish per person, and the use of nets to target spotted mackerel was prohibited. Since these changes to management, line fishing has become the main commercial method to catch Spotted Mackerel.<br/><br/>To improve and develop the stock assessment there is a need for: 1) a more comprehensive and structured monitoring approach to the collection of appropriate age-structured data from both the commercial and recreational sectors; 2) the recording of a better measure of effort and species identification in the commercial logbooks and recreational diaries to provide a more reliable indicator of CPUE; 3) a review of the historical catch data to confirm the assumed commencement of the fishery and magnitude of the catches; 4) a robust evaluation of the selectivity functions for the different fishing gears; <br/>5) an appraisal of the protocols used to age spotted mackerel; 6) a fishery-independent measure of changes in stock size; 7) investigations into the fecundity, spawning, recruitment processes and environmental-catch distributions of Spotted Mackerel; and 8) a periodic review and update of the data and models used in the assessment via a systematic and transparent stock assessment review process (Begg <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).

It favours sandy bays and is only recorded as abundant at a few sites (e.g., Bristol Channel, UK and Bertheaume Bay, France). <em>Raja microocellata</em> is taken as bycatch in trawl and set net fisheries, with most landings from the Bristol Channel and is commercially important for ports in parts of southern England. Given its restricted and patchy, fragmented geographical distribution and localised abundance local populations may potentially be vulnerable to declines caused by over-fishing, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic disturbance. This species is assessed as Near Threatened on the basis of suspected declines approaching 30%, as a result of high levels of exploitation, close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A4d. Fishery independent data for mature <em>R. microocellata</em> are limited and careful monitoring of populations of this species is required to determine accurate population trends of mature individuals.","Juveniles tend to occur in relatively shallow water, with larger individuals more abundant further from shore, though it is uncommon in waters more than 100m deep (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005a).

The fecundity has been estimated at 54-61 eggs per year, with egg-laying activity peaking between June and September (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Size at birth is approximately 10 cm TL (Ryland and Ajayi 1984).The feeding habits have been described for those populations inhabiting Carmarthen Bay (Ajayi 1977, 1982; Ellis unpublished) and the Cove of Bertheaume in Brittany (Rousset 1987) and it is known that they feed on a variety of crustaceans and teleosts (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2005). Juveniles predate primarily on small shrimps and amphipods, with fishes (e.g., sand eels and dragonets) becoming more important in the diets of larger individuals.","Taken as a bycatch in trawl and set net fisheries, with most landings from the Bristol Channel (ICES Division VIIf). <em>R. microocellata</em> is commercially important for ports in South Wales, Devon and Cornwall in the UK. Exploitation in areas further south is not known. Due to its restricted distribution, inshore habitats and overall scarcity, albeit with areas of localised abundance, it may be at risk from overfishing and habitat disturbance. Sand banks in the Bristol Channel (UK) are regularly dredged to supply the aggregate industry and the potential consequences of this activity on <em>R. microocellata</em> are unknown (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2005).","Over much of its geographical range it is relatively rare, though it can be locally abundant in certain areas, for example smalleyed ray is one of the dominant rajids occurring in the Bristol Channel (ICES division VIIf), Bertheaume Bay (Brittany) and south-eastern Ireland (Fahy and O'Reilly 1990, Rousset 1990, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005a,b). No formal stock assessments have been undertaken for this species. The Smalleyed Ray's geographic range is smaller than many of the more common European skates and rays. Furthermore there are certain areas where it is particularly abundant. For example, within UK waters it is only reported occasionally in the Irish Sea and North Sea, caught in low numbers in the English Channel and is very abundant in the Bristol Channel. Hence, this inshore species seems to have a fragmented population, possibly due to the fragmented nature of its favoured habitat. Catch rates in beam trawl surveys of the Bristol Channel appear steady (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2005b), though this is based on catch rates of all individuals.

Of those, the strongest age class were 4 year olds with all ages between 2 and 13 years well represented (Eastman 2001). A catch curve constructed from this data revealed that total mortality Z = 0.26, which is below acceptable fishing pressure and indicates the species is not being overexploited (J. St John pers. comm. 2003).
<br/>
<br/>Although the Breaksea Cod does not appear to be overexploited at present, there are several reasons to indicate this species could be vulnerable to overexploitation in the future and as such, should be re-assessed at regular intervals.
<br/>
<br/>1). The species has a relatively small global distribution.
<br/>2). It occurs in shallow waters, and is easy to catch by the recreational fishery (Prokop 2002) which has increased dramatically in recent years (J. St John pers. comm. 2003).
<br/>3). Like many other groupers, the Breaksea cod is large (&gt; 50 cm max. length), slow to mature (3–4 years) and long-lived (&gt; 20 years) making it vulnerable to overexploitation.
<br/>4). The youngest individuals taken by the recreational fishery were not sexually mature.
<br/>5). There are no restrictions on the commercial fishery.
<br/>
<br/>In contrast, it is reassuring that data from the commercial fishery is now being collected and that the species is solely distributed in Australia, a nation that places great emphasis on trying to manage its fisheries sustainably.
<br/>
<br/>This species is classified as Near Threatened as current data indicates a population reduction of ≥30% is possible (but neither definite nor probable) due to fishing over a 10 year or three generation period where the time period includes both past and the future i.e., just misses IUCN Criteria VU A4d.
<br/>
<br/>Jill St. John (Department of Fisheries, W.A. Marine Research Laboratories) provided important data for this assessment.","""Inhabits coastal reefs of south-western Australia, where it is commonly encountered by both anglers and divers"" (Hutchins and Swainston 1986). ""Often found around bommies and shallow reefs"" ( Prokop 2002). ""An inquisitive species, it readily approaches divers, but is also sighted resting on the bottom"" (Hutchins and Swainston 1986). Grows to a maximum length of 56 cm (<a href=""http://www.fishbase.org"">FishBase</a> 2003).
<br/>
<br/>Females can spawn from 231 mm, at the age of 3, with 50% mature at 260 mm. Males can spawn from 272 mm, at the age of 4, with 50% mature at 360 mm (Eastman 2001).
<br/>

St. John, pers. comm. 2003), as do some other large groupers, a trait that increases vulnerability to overexploitation.",Overfishing is the only threat known at present.,"""A relatively common inshore species"" (Prokop 2002).

10933431,44669,Choerodon schoenleinii,Near Threatened,,2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is a highly sought after food fish throughout its distribution. It is high on the list of regularly caught species by recreational fishers at surveyed locations in Western Australia and is a prized species in many areas of south-east Asia, including Sabah, Japan and Hong Kong. There has been a severe decline in its abundance in Hong Kong since the 1940s and it is now considered rare in that location (A. Cornish, pers. comm.; Cornish 2003). Choerodon schoenleinii is a large species, reaching up to 100 cm, and it is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite, with very low numbers of males recorded in Shark Bay, Western Australia (Ebisawa <em>et al</em>. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Those two studies demonstrated that male fish occur only in the largest size classes, i.e., &gt; <em>ca</em>. 50 cm, and these are commonly the target of fishers, e.g., in Hong Kong (Cornish 2003). Heavy fishing pressure for local and live reef fish trade use would have rapidly reduced the numbers of males in assemblages of this species and would have undoubtedly contributed to its rapid decline in locations such as Hong Kong. It is also considered to be overexploited in Japan (Ebisawa <em>et al</em>. 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Thus, heavy fishing pressure coupled with the large scale use of destructive fishing practices in south-east Asia and overall low abundances in that region (Werner and Allen 2000, Allen and McKenna 2001) put this species at risk in a substantial proportion of its range. <em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> should be considered to be Near Threatened and it almost meets the criteria for Vulnerable: VU A2cd and/or VU A3cd and/or VU A4cd. This species should be monitored regularly for further evidence of population decline/ or fragmentation and every effort made to obtain information on its fishery, especially in southeastern Asia and Japan.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Regional status:</strong>
<br/>
<br/><strong>Australia</strong>
<br/><em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is widely distributed and is probably not threatened in many areas of Australia due to the remoteness of its northern coastline, where this species occurs. However, individual assemblages in some areas where there is heavy recreational or commercial fishing pressure may be under threat of localised depletions, e.g., Shark Bay, Dampier and Broome in Western Australia and parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland.
<br/>
<br/>SE Asia
<br/>
<br/><strong>Hong Kong</strong>
<br/><em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> fetches the highest prices for any live reef fish caught in Hong Kong. The species is now extremely rare in Hong Kong, e.g., three seen in roughly 750 dives throughout Hong Kong waters since 1995, (Cornish, pers. comm. 2004) and while it has long been commercially extinct, it was abundant enough in the 1940s to support a small dedicated fishery using longlines with sea-urchins as bait (Cornish 2003).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Malaysia</strong>
<br/>""Usually dwells in the vicinity of coral reefs, common length 28.6 cm. Not a commercial fish as it does not have a good reputation as a food fish in Peninsular Malaysia. Highly priced in Sabah. Some people like the larger fishes which are highly esteemed in Hong Kong""  (Mohsin and Ambak 1996).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Other</strong>
<br/><em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is most likely to be threatened in areas of south-east Asia, e.g., the Ryukyu Islands (Ebisawa <em>et al</em>. 1995), the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, since <em>C. schoenleinii</em> is a commercial target in many of these areas and methods such as explosives, poisoning, spearfishing and night-time fisheries, are commonly used to capture fish. Many of these countries have used these methods for a long period of time and thus not only localised population declines are likely, but also the destruction of important habitats on a broader scale (TRACC 2004). It is valued eating fish and one of the best among the wrasses for its flesh (A. Nakazono, pers. comm.).
<br/>
<br/><strong>The Live Reef Food Fish Trade</strong>
<br/>Although not among the 13 most common species in the trade which sources reef fishes from the Indo-Pacific for export primarily to Hong Kong (China), this species is nonetheless included in the lucrative and large international live fish trade (Lee and Sadovy 1998, Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although import quantities are not available for this species alone, except for the occasional record (e.g., at least 60.5 kg was brought into Hong Kong in May 2000 by live fish vessel: Clarus Chu, pers. comm.), substantial numbers of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> are included in the trade at sizes generally of 25–40 cm, probably less than that at which sexual maturity is attained (A. Cornish, pers. comm. 2004).","<em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is a demersal species and is abundant in shallow water reefs in waters of north-western Australia and along the Queensland coast (&lt; 20 m) (Allen 1999, Hutchins 2001, Grant 1993, Randall <em>et. al</em>. 1997, Fairclough, in prep). It is, however, reported to occur in waters up to 60 m deep (Westneat 2004). It is found on sand and weed areas adjacent to coral reefs (Grant 1993, Randall <em>et. al</em>. 1997, Allen 1999). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, it is found on rocky limestone reefs, weedy rock areas, rocky shorelines and seagrass areas (Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough in prep.). In particular, limestone and coral patch reefs are important for adults of this species in Shark Bay (Fairclough, in prep.). Juveniles (&lt; <em>ca</em>. 150 mm) are found in weedy rock or seagrass habitats, but fish above this size are more common on open reefs in Shark Bay, for example (Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough, in prep.). Kanashiro (1998) demonstrated that seagrass beds were important for this species during the first few months of life with the presence of larvae and small juveniles in these habitats at Yagachi Island, Japan.
<br/>
<br/><em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> reaches lengths of up to 100 cm and <em>ca</em>. 16 kg in weight (Grant 1993). It is a protogynous hermaphrodite and is an indeterminate multiple spawner (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Fifty percent of females mature at <em>ca</em>. 25 cm and it spawns mainly in spring in both Shark Bay, Western Australia, and at Okinawa Island, Japan (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Fairclough, in prep.). Histology demonstrated that this species is monandric and that relatively small testes indicate that male fish would spawn with only one to a few females at once (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Fairclough in prep). Males only occur in the upper size classes (&gt; <em>ca</em>. 50 cm) and low numbers of males recorded in the population in Shark Bay and at Okinawa Island, Japan, also suggest that this species would be haremic (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Fairclough, in prep.). Since catch rates derived from line fishing or densities derived from visual surveys in Shark Bay demonstrated little variation during the different months of the year (Fairclough, in prep.), it is unlikely that this species forms large spawning aggregations.","A minimum legal size of 40 cm and a catch limit of four tuskfish per person per day in the west coast and Gascoyne regions of Western Australia limits the capture of <em>C. schoenlenii</em> in those two regions (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published on Western Australian stocks. In the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These catch limit regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west coast and Gascoyne regions of W.A. <br/> <br/>In Shark Bay, Western Australia, for example, only a relatively few fish &gt; 40 cm, the minimum legal length for retention, are captured by line fishing, thus reducing the impact of fishing on this species in that embayment (Fairclough in prep.). Records of catches of recreational fishers in Western Australia indicate that <em>C. schoenleinii</em> is regularly one of the top ten species caught from areas of the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of Western Australia, e.g., Dampier and Broome (Newman <em>et. al</em>. 2003). Thus, there may be the potential for localised depletions of this species in areas of Western Australia, where commercial and/or recreational fishing pressure is high. Catches of the combined tuskfish and parrotfish category in the Northern Territory and Queensland are low, hence it is unlikely to be under widespread threat in these regions (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm., J. Platten, DPIF Queensland, pers. comm.). However, it is specifically targeted by recreational fishers in Moreton Bay, Queensland, which may have a localised impact on this species’ abundance (Grant 1993). <br/> <br/>There is little specific information on the level of exploitation of this species throughout south-east Asia. However, Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. (1995) states that <em>C. schoenleinii</em> is an important commercial species in Okinawa, Japan, and that it is overexploited. The majority of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> caught in this region range in length from 20 to 35 cm and thus, based on studies of the reproductive biology of this species, many captured fish are likely to be sexually immature (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). <br/> <br/>Destructive fishing practices, e.g., explosives, spearfishing, poisoning and night-time fishing, used in many parts of south-east Asia to capture fish for local consumption, the live reef fish trade and the aquarium trade, are likely to cause, or may already have caused, declines in stocks of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> in these areas (Munday and Allen 2000, Chou <em>et. al</em>. 2002, Wabnitz <em>et. al</em>. 2003, TRACC 2004). However, there is little data to suggest how much <em>C. schoenleinii</em> contributes to these fisheries. Furthermore, any continued destruction of habitats will lead to further fragmentation of stocks and ultimately to their decline. Land clearing, and thus sedimentation from increased run-off, and poor sanitation in south-east Asian countries, such as Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, also have the potential to destroy important nearshore habitats (Munday and Allen 2000, Chou <em>et. al</em>. 2002). In south-east Asia, it has been estimated that 56 % of all coral reefs are at high risk, and 26% are of medium risk from human disturbance (Bryant <em>et. al</em>. 1998).","<strong>Australia</strong>
<br/><em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is abundant in many areas of Shark Bay, Western Australia (Fairclough in prep.), and Hutchins (2001) demonstrated that densities ranged from occasional to abundant at locations northwards from Ningaloo reef to Wyndham (15º29'S, 128º7'E). This species is probably equally abundant along the coastlines of the Northern Territory and Queensland, Australia, since this species is distributed across the whole of the northern half of Australia and commercial and recreational catches of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> in the Northern Territory and Queensland are low to moderate (Penn 2002; P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.; J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Its distribution along the western and eastern coastlines of Australia is likely to be fairly continuous within its range, due to similar habitat being available throughout (Hutchins 2001, Grant, 1993). However, the degree of fragmentation of its distribution and levels of abundance in the Northern Territory of Australia are unclear.
<br/>
<br/><strong>SE Asia</strong>
<br/>Throughout south-east Asia, the distribution of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> is probably widespread, since coastal reef habitats are virtually ubiquitous in this region. For example, it was reported to occur from Papua to Sumatra in Indonesia by Allen and Adrim (2003). However, it is rarely reported as being common, e.g., <em>C. schoenleinii</em> was reported to be rare with only sub-adults seen during a rapid biodiversity assessment of the Calamianes Islands (Palawan Province, Philippines) (Werner and Allen 2000) and was not seen at all during similar surveys of the coral reefs of Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea (Werner and Allen 1998), the Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, Indonesia (McKenna <em>et. al</em>. 2002), or the Togean and Banggai Islands, Sulawesi, Indonesia (Allen and McKenna 2001). This may be due to fragmentation of the populations of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> caused by naturally low abundances and/or localised stock depletions due to fishing pressure and destruction of habitat. The latter may be fairly widespread. For example, in Sabah, Borneo, and Indonesia, fishing pressure is concentrated in the inshore region of the coastline and destructive collection methods have depleted most of the inshore fish stocks (TRACC  2004). Destruction of coral reef habitat is also likely to be a contributing factor (see Threats).
<br/>
<br/>In Okinawa, Japan, and Hong Kong <em>C. schoenleinii</em> is/was a very important commercial species and is suggested to be overexploited (Ebisawa <em>et. al</em>. 1995, Cornish 2003).",Unknown,"<em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> occurs as far south on the Western Australian coast as the Houtman-Abrolhos Islands (a group of islands and reefs ca. 70 km offshore at ca 28°45'S, 113°45'E), however, it is considered to be rare at this location (Hutchins 2001). <em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> was not recorded on inshore coastal reefs south of Shark Bay (ca. 26°S, 113.5°E) during the surveys of Hutchins (2001). Surveys by Hutchins (2001, 2003) and Newman <em>et al</em>. (2003) demonstrate that <em>C. schoenleinii</em> occurs along the northern Pilbara/Kimberley coastline of Western Australia as far north as Wyndham (15°29'S, 128°7'E), but not on the offshore atolls along this coast, i.e., Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef and Ashmore reef. <em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is a target for commercial fishers, fishing tour operators and recreational fishers in Darwin, Northern Territory, and is thus probably widespread in this region (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.). It is taken by recreational and commercial fishers along the Queensland coastline, in particular the Great Barrier Reef, where this species is widely distributed (Grant 1993; J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). <em>Choerodon schoenleinii</em> is likely to occur throughout south-east Asia, such as the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands, where it is a commercial target (Westneat 2004, Ebisawai<em>et al</em>. 1995). It is probably equally well distributed throughout the rest of its range, e.g., along the Viet Nam and Thailand coastlines, around Malaysia, Indonesia, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and south to Vanuatu, where it is also reported to occur (Eli 2002, Allen and Adrim 2003). Many of these areas provide suitable habitats for this species. A report of <em>C. schoenleinii</em> occurring in Mauritius must be treated with some caution, since there is no evidence of it occurring between Mauritius and south-east Asia (Eli 2002).",,Marine,"A minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm and a catch limit of four tuskfish per person per day in the west coast and Gascoyne regions of Western Australia limits the capture of <em>C. schoenlenii</em> in those two regions (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published on Western Australian stocks. In the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These catch limit regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west coast and Gascoyne regions of W.A. Although, in the future, the MLL may change in all regions of WA where <em>C. schoenleinii</em> occurs, to reflect increased knowledge of the biology of this species (Fairclough in prep.), the catch limit is unlikely to change from four fish per person per day, unless it is reduced further. These limits are based on the type of life history that a particular species has. Thus, tuskfish are included in the category of ""highest risk"" (Harrison 2001). Species in this category are generalised as having the following characteristics: they are long-lived, slow-growing, they mature at four years plus, form semi-resident populations, are vulnerable to localised depletion due to their life history, or are of low abundance or highly targeted (Harrison 2001). There is also a MLL of 30 cm in Queensland and a catch limit of six tuskfish per person per day. However, in the Northern Territory, while there is a catch limit for recreational fishers, there is no MLL.
<br/>
<br/>In Shark Bay, Western Australia, several small sanctuary (no take) zones, i.e., Surf Point, Mary Anne Island, Gudrun Wreck and Sandy Point, are likely to encompass habitats occupied by C. schoenleinii (Anonymous 1996, Fairclough in prep.). There are eight no take sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. Spearfishing of tuskfish is prohibited throughout the marine park (Anonymous 2004). Proposals are currently being considered for new marine parks on the north-west coast of Western Australia (Penn 2002), including the Dampier Archipelago and the Montebello Islands, where <em>C. schoenleinii</em> was recorded frequently during surveys by Hutchins (2001). Marine Parks in Western Australia do not necessarily imply no-take zones, but may include no take zones within their boundaries or restrictions on catch limits or methods used for capture.
<br/>
<br/>In Queensland, there is a minimum legal length for retention of 30 cm and a catch limit of six fish per person per day (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2003). Approximately 5.1 million hectares of Queensland marine waters are declared marine parks and, of this, 603,000 hectares are fish habitat areas, where fishing is allowed, but the habitat is protected from development (Anonymous 2000). These areas stretch along the entire Queensland coastline (Anonymous 2000). It is likely that <em>C. schoenleinii</em> occurs in at least several of these protected areas. In the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a proposed rezoning plan will result in ca 33% of the geographical area of the park being designated as no take zones (GBRMPA 2003). It is likely that <em>C. schoenleinii</em> occurs in several of these protected areas.
<br/>
<br/>While many marine parks have been introduced in areas within the range of <em>C. schoenleinii</em>, e.g., Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippines, most of these are considered to be ‘paper parks’ and are poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced. Only 8% of the 100,000 km² of coral reefs in southeast Asia is included in marine protected areas and only 14% of the 646 MPAs are considered effective, hence the majority of these MPAs probably provide little protection to the species they house (Licuanan and Gomez 2000, Chou <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Local fishermen in Okinawa started a regulation not to catch this species smaller than 1 kg (<a href=""http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/eco/20030328_4.html"">A. Nakazono, pers. comm.</a>).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Although the estimated population size is above the thresholds for any of the categories for threat, it is not large (34,000–166,000 adults and sub-adults) and the number of mature individuals is unknown.  The estimated number of spawning females for the Klamath River (which supports most of the northern DPS) is only 760–1,500 per year. However, four out of seven (57%) of the known spawning locations have been lost within the last three generations for reasons, not all of which are clearly understood, and may not have ceased or reversible. <br/> <br/>Green Sturgeon are not subjected to overfishing and habitat fragmentation that have affected other sturgeon species. There are active fisheries restrictions in place throughout the species’ range in the U.S. and Canada. <br/> <br/>The current adult–subadult population size is estimated at least in the tens of thousands and there is no evidence of overall population decline, although four of the seven known spawning locations may have been lost. Considerable research is underway or planned to fill in information gaps on stock structure, abundance and migrations.  Although Green Sturgeon currently does not warrant ""threatened"" status under U.S. Endangered Species Act, concerns remain about the limited number of spawning rivers, potential growth of fisheries, and persistent habitat threats from water withdrawals and agricultural pesticides. Given the species’ life history characteristics and limited number of spawning sites, it is considered likely that the species would quickly move into a threatened category if current conservation efforts were withdrawn. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","The Green Sturgeon is among the most marine oriented and widespread of the sturgeons. Like most sturgeons, the Green Sturgeon is characterized by large size, longevity, delayed maturation, high fecundity, and far-ranging movements. Green Sturgeon reach sizes up to 2.7 m and have been aged to over 50 years (Nakamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995, Farr <em>et al</em>. 2002). Mortality rates of subadults and adults are low and probably do not exceed 10% per year from natural causes based on age frequency analysis.  Males typically mature at about 15–17 years and 1.5–1.8 m, while females typically mature at 20–25 years and 1.8–2.1 m (Van Eenennaam and Doroshov  2001a). Similarly aged males are generally smaller than females with males from the northern DPS achieving a maximum size of 168 cm, while sexually mature males and females from the southern DPS range in size from 139 to199 cm and 157 to 223 cm, respectively (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Spawning is believed to occur every 3-5 years and the generation time is 27–33 years (Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Green Sturgeon are oviparious broadcast spawners and adult Green Sturgeon typically migrate into freshwater beginning in late February and spawning occurs in April to June in deep, turbulent river mainstems (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Klamath and Rogue River populations appear to spawn within 160 km of the ocean while the Sacramento population may travel over 320 km upriver. Green Sturgeon eggs and larvae are comparatively larger than those of other sturgeon species. For example, Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a egg diameter of 4.34, 3.40 and 2.62 mm for green, white, and Atlantic Sturgeon (<em>A. oxyrinchus</em>) respectfully indicating that Green Sturgeon have eggs which have a volume twice that of white and over four times that of Atlantic Sturgeon. Consequently, Green Sturgeon have a relatively lower fecundity in comparison to other similar sized sturgeon species as reproductive energy is more heavily invested in egg size rather than egg number (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001b, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000). Fecundity varies with age and size, but has been estimated to be in the order of  2,800 eggs per kilogram bodyweight; approximately half that of White Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser transmontanus</em>) at 5,648 eggs per kilogram bodyweight (Moyle 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The eggs do not form a thick jelly coat as do those of other North American sturgeon and exhibit poor adhesion to substrate (Deng 2000, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000), which would indicate sensitivity to turbidity loading  (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1994, Moyle 2002). Furthermore, the larger eggs and higher growth rates of developing Green Sturgeon in comparison to other North American sturgeons suggests that a higher oxygen demand may be required for proper embryonic development; thus Green Sturgeon may require colder, cleaner water for spawning. (USFWS 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Eggs hatch in 7 to 9 days at 15°C (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that temperatures above 20°C are lethal to embryos and temperatures above 24°C significantly reduce five-day larval growth rates. Larvae begin to feed at 10 days post hatch and complete metamorphosis into juveniles at 45 days (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Juvenile Green Sturgeon grow rapidly reaching 60 cm within 2–3 years and they spend 1–4 years in fresh and estuarine waters before dispersal to saltwater (Beamsesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon are commonly observed in bays and estuaries up and down the coast and large concentrations enter the Columbia River estuary, and Washington's Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay during late summer (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Limited tagging studies show that tagged individuals from the Columbia River have been recaptured off the west coast of Vancouver Island (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>During the 1 to 4 years of freshwater residence, juveniles gradually move to deeper and more saline areas as they grow (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). As juveniles grow, they exhibit greater tolerance to salinity and achieve seawater tolerance at seven months or sooner (Allen and Cech 2003). Adults return to freshwater to spawn, and Green Sturgeon have been reported to spawn up to 160 km upstream in the Klamath and Rogue rivers, and over 300 km upstream in the Sacramento River (Beamesderder and Webb 2002). After spawning, they to sea in late autumn to early winter when temperatures drop below 10°C and flows increased above 100 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles are opportunistic benthic feeders with a diet consisting of various invertebrates and fish (EPIC 2001, Moyle 2002).  Stomach content analysis indicates that adult Green Sturgeon have a marine diet consisting of various benthic invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms, amphioids, and isopods (EPIC 2001), but have also been observed feeding on sand lances (<em>Ammodytes hexapterus</em>) and other fish.","Sturgeon exhibit a combination of morphology, life history and habitat requirements that make them highly susceptible to negative impacts from human activities (Boreman 1997).  Anthropogenic activities known to impact sturgeon include: exploitation   blockage of available freshwater spawning habitat through diking, damming causing inadequate flow regimes, channelization, elimination of backwater areas, dewatering of streams, destruction of thermal refugia, loss of deep pools, inundation of habitat by reservoirs, and exposure to bioaccumulating industrial and municipal pollution, (Boreman 1997, EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The long life span and late age of maturity makes sturgeon vulnerable to chronic and acute effects of bioaccumulation. White Sturgeon, for example have been found to have the greatest contaminant concentrations compared to salmonids, suckers, Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Pacific Lamprey (<em>Lampetra tridentata</em>), and Eulachon (<em>Thaleichthys pacificus</em>), [USEPA 1999]. Whole body concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (19 ųg/kg), DDT (787 ųg/kg), p,p’DDE (620 ųg/kg), Aroclors (173 ųg/kg), and dioxins were an order of magnitude higher in concentration than all other species tested.  Although Green Sturgeon are less exposed to anthropogenic contaminants due to their marine migratory phase, there is the potential for exposure when entering freshwater to spawn and during estuarine concentrations. <br/> <br/>Marine and estuarine environments in Canada are of concern as they are heavily impacted by a number of activities including logging, aquaculture, agriculture and urbanization, and can be the eventual sinks to freshwater pollutants. However, a 1994 assessment of the quality of the lower Fraser River ecosystem indicated that no dramatic changes in species assemblages were determined to have occurred since the previous study in 1974 (Healey <em>et al</em>. 1994) despite an increase in usage. Area managed for conservation also increased from 23 to 69% over the same time period with 80% of the increase being accounted for by conservation efforts on the Fraser River estuary (MWLAP 2002). The increase in estuary protection and the results from Healey <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggests that estuarine habitat loss that may effect Green Sturgeon is likely not substantial in Canada. <br/> <br/>In the US, where all known spawning populations occur, Green Sturgeon have lost spawning habitat to poor land use practices and habitat alteration through water management projects (EPIC 2001). This has caused a decline in general water quality in some areas through increased sedimentation as well as the loss of deep pools which Green Sturgeon are known to prefer. Furthermore, damming of river systems can block previously available spawning habitat, affect natural flow regimes, potentially reduce areas of thermal refugia, and change sediment transport characteristics of the river which may cascade and impact sturgeon by modifying ecosystem community structure (EPIC 2001). For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). <br/> <br/>Beamesderfer and Webb (2002 suggest that habitat conditions throughout the Green Sturgeon range have stabilized or are improving, but the results of spawning surveys have yet to substantiate that (NMFS 2002). Most of the northern population segment spawns in the Klamath River. Potential threats to this population include concentration of spawning, harvest (especially in mixed-stock estuarine fisheries), and loss of spawning habitat such as the Columbia River, and the Eel and South Fork, and Trinity Rrivers in California (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The southern population segment (south of the Eel River) is more of a concern because it has fewer spawners (limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin system), which makes it more susceptible to catastrophic events. These fish also face potentially lethal temperature limits, entrainment by water projects, and may be adversely affected by pesticides and other toxic substances and exotic species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is probable that Green Sturgeon spawning habitat has been lost behind dams and water diversions throughout the Central Valley (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District pumping plant). <br/> <br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> <br/>Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in two three fisheries. The smaller bycatch occurs in Klamath River Tribal salmon gill net fisheries while the larger portion is in the White Sturgeon commercial and sport fisheries (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). Total annual harvest of Green Sturgeon declined substantially to 1,192 fish in 1999–2001 from 6,871 fish in 1985–1989. Most of this earlier harvest came from the Columbia River (51%) and Washington coastal fisheries (28%). In recent years, Columbia and Washington coastal harvest was substantially reduced and in 2001 these two bycatch fisheries and that of the Klamath River tribes were about equal in number. Catch reduction in the Columbia River is a result of increasingly restrictive regulations. For the sturgeon sport fishery, slot limits prohibit retention of fish (white or green) less than 107 cm (42 inches) or more than 152 cm (60 inches). Green Sturgeon retained as bycatch in the commercial fishery must be between 122 and 168 cm (48-66 inches). <br/> <br/>Klamath Tribal fisheries (Yurok and Hoopa) accounted for an average 266 adult fish annually from 1986–2001 with no apparent trend. This fishery is monitored but not regulated. California sport catch of Green Sturgeon, primarily in San Pablo Bay, is not monitored, but is thought to be only a few fish each year (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). California slot size limits for both sturgeon species is 117–183 cm (46–72 inches). <br/> <br/>There is also a bycatch in the domestic trawl fishing industry in B.C., which takes about 171 Green Sturgeon annually (Davis 2004). <br/> <br/>There is no information on the extent of illegal exploitation of Green Sturgeon, but poaching activity on White Sturgeon in the lower Fraser River is a concern (Ptolemy and Vennesland 2003).","Preliminary population genetics results suggest that Green Sturgeon from the Klamath and Rogue rivers are similar to each other but distinct from fish from San Pablo Bay. Green Sturgeon commonly occur in the lower Columbia River (Oregon–Washington) and genetic samples taken there appear to be a mixture of the other populations (Israel <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2003) has determined that, based on genetic evidence of discreteness, there are two Distinct Population Segments (DPS's) for Green Sturgeon. The northern population ranges from the Eel River, California, to at least the Rogue River, Oregon. The southern population is principally comprised of the Sacramento River spawning stock.
<br/>
<br/>Their wide distribution, large numbers observed seasonally in some areas, and projections based on demographic rates suggest that total Green Sturgeon numbers are at least in the tens of thousands (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). The largest known spawning stock of Green Sturgeon is that of the Klamath River and its tributary, the Trinity River. The Klamath River population is estimated to number up to 66,000 individuals of which 3,000 would be mature adults. Actual spawner numbers in the Klamath were estimated at 760–1,500 females per year based on average harvest and total mortality rates (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Based on a review of recent tagging studies, harvest analyses, and stock assessments from many locations, Beamesderfer and Webb (2002) estimated that the total adult and subadult population size of Green Sturgeon is within the range of 34,000 to 160,000 fish. Of these, greatest abundance was recorded for the Columbia River estuary, and ocean and bay waters of Oregon and Washington.
<br/>
<br/>Attempts to determine trends in sturgeon abundance in the northern DPS have been inconclusive regarding the status of Green Sturgeon, and the status of the northern Green Sturgeon population is unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Similar attempts to determine the status of Green Sturgeon in the southern DPS were also inconclusive, and with the exception of anecdotal evidence of a reduction of Green Sturgeon entrainment at water export facilities indicative of a population decline, the status of the southern DPS is also unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).",Stable,"Green Sturgeon is an anadromous species that spend most of their life in near-shore marine and estuarine waters from Mexico to southeast Alaska (Houston 1988, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Large concentrations of Green Sturgeon are still found in coastal estuaries, but their range in freshwater has been restricted by damming in some rivers. For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). Spawning is presently known to occur in only three rivers in North America, all of which are in the United States: the Rogue River in Oregon (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Rien <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the Klamath and Sacramento river systems in California (EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002, CDFG 2002, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1992,1994).  Spawning populations have been extirpated from the San Joaquin, Eel, South Fork, and Trinity rivers, and possibly the Umpqua River (EPIC 2001, NMFS 2002). Seasonal concentrations occur in several estuaries including the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Eel, Columbia, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor and the Fraser River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Fishery managers in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have recognized the sensitivity of Green Sturgeon to fishing and have actively restricted commercial and sport fisheries everywhere Green Sturgeon occur. None of the reviews examined mentioned any legal, regional, national or international trade in Green Sturgeon products. This species is not considered as good to eat as White Sturgeon and markets for their flesh are limited. <br/> <br/>Due to life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events Green Sturgeon has a designation of ""Special Concern"" in Canada (Houston 1988, Davies 2004), and no harvest is allowed in Canadian waters. <br/> <br/>In response to a petition to list Green Sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a status review for this species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). NMFS determined that the species is comprised of two distinct population segments (DPS) but that neither warrants listing as a threatened or endangered species at this time (NMFS 2003). However, because of remaining uncertainties about their population structure and status, both DPS populations were added to the agency's list of candidate species and will be reevaluated in five years provided sufficient new information becomes available.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is sexually dimorphic with a maximum longevity of 15 years.&#160;Prior to 1977, this fish was heavily exploited due to unrestricted fishing conducted largely by foreign fleets, but also domestic.

Furthermore, since this species has been identified as an important trophic link in its ecosystem, additional emphasis towards maintaining healthy populations should be recognized. Solutions to issues such as the misidentification of this species within the fishery and quantifying natural mortality should be explored in order to reduce uncertainty in future stock assessments.","<em>Merluccius bilinearis</em> is benthopelagic and occurs over continental shelves and slopes with sandy, muddy, or pebbly substrate. It most commonly found in temperatures between 7-10°C.<br/><br/>It is considered to be an important component of the ecosystem where it plays significant roles as both prey and predator (Northeast Fisheries Science Center 2011). For protection from visual predators, juveniles persist in areas with high densities of amphipod tubes because the dorsal colouration of 0-year <em>M. bilinearis</em> mimic the pattern of amphipod tubes viewed against the bottom. Juvenile <em>M. bilinearis</em> preferred prey (amphipods and shrimp) are also found in these areas (Auster <em>et al</em>. 1997). Lloris <em>et al</em>. (2005) found that the recruitment of <em>M. bilinearis</em> in an area positively correlates with the abundance of Atlantic Mackerel, <em>Scomber scombrus</em>, a preferred prey species of <em>M. bilinearis</em>. It is a voracious predator with cannibalistic habits. Smaller <em>M. bilinearis</em> feed on crustaceans (euphausiids and pandalids), while larger <em>M. bilinearis</em> (over 40 cm total length (TL)) feed on fishes (clupeids, <em>Scomber scombrus</em>, <em>Urophycis chuss</em>, <em>Gadus morhua</em>) (Cohen <em>et al</em>. 1990, Lloris <em>et al</em>. 2005). It embarks on daily vertical migrations to hunt at night. During late spring and early summer, adults move to shallower waters. It returns to deeper waters in the autumn and winter with the older, larger fish in the deepest portion (Brodziak <em>et al</em>. 2001). Juveniles also display similar seasonal distribution patterns, only congregating in shallower waters (Lloris <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The maximum total length is 76 cm (Robins and Ray 1986, Cohen <em>et al</em>. 1990) and its longevity is ~15 years (Auster <em>et al</em>. 1997). However, there is evidence for age truncation due to fishery pressure whereas fish older than age six are now rarely encountered (Brodziak <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/><br/>Cohen <em>et al</em>. (1990) and Lloris <em>et al</em>. (2005) found spawning to be related to water temperature. Spawning occurs in shallower waters from June to July in the mid-Atlantic region, July to August in the Gulf of Maine and to the north of Georges Bank, and August to September on the Scotian Shelf. Richards (2006) recorded spawning from May to November off New England and into the winter off mid-Atlantic states. Peak spawning occurs between May-June for the southern stock and July-August for the northern. After two months of remaining in the water column, embryos and larvae measuring ~17-20 mm standard length (SL) descend to the bottom (Auster <em>et al</em>. 1997). Fecundity is thought to be as high as other species of this genus (Lloris <em>et al</em>. 2005). Sexual maturity is similar in males and females, between two and three years (29 to 33 cm length) on Georges Bank and one to two years (females 26 to 27 cm length; males 23 to 24 cm length) on the Scotian Shelf (Lloris et al. 2005). Compared to males, females grow faster, live longer, and are larger (Cohen et al. 1990, Lloris <em>et al</em>. 2005). Females reach a maximum size of 76 cm and can live up to 15 years. Male <em>M. bilinearis</em> have a maximum size of 41 cm and can live up to nine years. Females release up to three batches of pelagic eggs per spawning season (Collette and Klein-MacPhee 2002).&#160;<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span

species has been commercially exploited for many years and as a result, populations have shown evidence of overfishing.","This is a relatively common species in the northern parts of its range, becoming less common south of South Carolina (Cohen <em>et al</em>. 1990). It is often found in large aggregations.<br/><br/>Total global catch peaked in 1965, subsequently declined by 84% over the next five years, increased by 148% over the following three years, and finally declined sharply after new fishery laws were enacted in 1977 that effectively reduced effort by at least 48-90%. Prior to 1977, the bulk of fishing effort was conducted by foreign fleets (Russia, Cuba, and Japan) and was unrestricted. From the early 2000s until present, this species has been targeted by only U.S. and Canadian fleets. Over the past three generation lengths (15 to 21 years), the population of <em>M. bilinearis</em> appears to be stable in Canadian waters (approximately 25% of its global distribution), but has been declining by 46-56% in US waters (approximately 75% of its global distribution). Therefore, the global population is estimated to have declined by approximately 30-45% over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>The U.S. commercial fishery for this species is separated into two stocks: the northern from the Gulf of Maine to Georges Bank and the southern from the southern Georges Bank through the Mid-Atlantic Bight. During the summer, fish from both stocks can co-occur on Georges Bank. During the winter, fish from the northern stock migrate to the Gulf of Maine while the southern stock moves further offshore to the outer shelf and slope. Between 1987-1999 (12 years), U.S. landings were relatively stable, gradually declined by 73% over the next 7 years, and then increased by 68% over the following 4 years (up to year 2010 with 9,600 metric tons). In 2012, U.S. landings were 6,940 metric tons. Recreational fishermen do not target Silver Hake and the species is taken in negligible amounts.<br/><br/>Fishery-independent trawl surveys conducted annually in the fall and spring by the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center collect abundance data for marine species that occur over the U.S. Northeast continental shelf. Although the survey indices are variable, the fall survey suggests declines in biomass indices of 46-56% over 15 to 21 years (three generation lengths). The two most recent stock assessments, published in 2006 and 2011, concluded that both U.S. stocks of the Silver Hake are not overfished and are not undergoing overfishing (Northeast Fisheries Science Center 2006, 2011). However, Lloris <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted that <em>M. bilinearis</em> from United States waters rarely exceeded six years of age during the past few years, which is likely due to fisheries targeting larger individuals. The U.S. stock assessments for Silver Hake recognize a certain amount of uncertainty for the following reasons: trends in population size and fishery removals are not consistent between each other, there is some identification confusion with the Offshore Hake within the fishery (Garcia-Vazquez <em>et al</em>. 2012), and the level of natural mortality due to predators is not yet clearly quantified (Link <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Canadian commercial fishery has been active on the Scotian Shelf, specifically the Emerald and LaHave basins, since 1995. A declining shift in the age composition from predominantly ages 2-4 to 1-2 occurred between the 1970s to the mid-1990s was observed during the transition from the foreign fishery to the domestic fishery. The current landings quota has been set at 15,000 metric tonnes since 2003 and has not been exceeded (averages 11,100 metric tonnes). Total landings are dictated by market demand, not reduced abundance. The Canadian government also maintains fishery-dependent and independent research surveys to advise biomass assessments. According to fishery-independent survey results, population biomass estimates indicate an increasing trend since 2008 and biomass in general has returned to similar levels recorded in the 1980s. Additionally, bycatch represents less than 4% of the total catch monitored by observers (DFO 2013). Biomass indices from the fisheries independent survey on the Scotian Shelf have been increasing since 2005; the trend over the past three generation lengths appears to be stable (DFO 2013).",Unknown,"<em>Merluccius bilinearis</em>&#160;is distributed in the northwest and central Atlantic Ocean from Canada south along the U.S. to southeast Florida (Cohen <em>et al.</em> 1990,&#160;Lloris <em>et al.</em> 2005,&#160;R. Robertson pers. comm. 2013). Its depth range is 0-914 m (Lloris <em>et al.</em> 2005), but is most abundant on sandy&#160;continental shelf between 50-300 m (Cohen <em>et al. </em>1990). A record off Trinidad/Venezuela requires verification.","This species supports a commercial fishery, largely due to the ease in capturing large numbers by bottom trawling.&#160;It&#160;is sold fresh, frozen, gutted, whole or in fillets, and in the past, as fishmeal&#160;(Lloris&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Small-mesh trawl fisheries are currently operated on the Scotian Shelf, the Gulf of Maine, and Georges Bank&#160;by Canada and the United States. Between 1962-1977, foreign fleets comprised the bulk of the effort in this fishery. It is the most popular hake sold in the northeast United States.",Marine,"In U.S waters, this species came under management via the New England Fishery Management Council’s Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan following passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1977. This action also caused the exclusion of foreign fleets which effectively reduced effort in the Silver Hake fishery. In 2000, bag limits on the small-mesh multispecies fishery were implemented based on net mesh size and gear restrictions to reduce bycatch were set. Recently, the council established annual catch limits and accountability measures for the fishery. In addition to these regulations, fishermen must undergo a permitting process, there is a cap on the amount of bycatch that each vessel may take, and the fishing itself is limited seasonally and spatially.&#160;In Canadian waters, the annual landings quota has been set at 15,000 metric tonnes since 2003 and the fishery is monitored by the Canadian Division of Fisheries and Oceans. The Canadian fleet is also required to use certain gear types aimed at reducing bycatch.","",,false,false,Global
17025021,10082,Hippocampus reidi,Near Threatened,A2d+4d,2017,2016-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Hippocampus reidi </em>is a coastal seahorse species that inhabits corals, seagrasses, estuaries, and especially macroalgae&#160;and mangroves from North Carolina, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, to southern Brazil. The species is threatened by the loss and degradation of some of its preferred habitats, particularly mangroves, due to coastal development. It is particularly threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and artisanal fisheries (and subsequently used for curios, religious amulets, or traditional medicines), and by being targeted for aquarium use. Although its listing on CITES Appendix II aims to regulate international trade to be sustainable, little is known about domestic trade, illegal and unreported trade, and the overall level of offtake from wild populations. Fishers have also recorded substantial declines in seahorses through much of this species' range. Based on fisher interview data and national listings in Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, it is inferred that that this species has declined by more than 30% through most of its range, with declines ongoing. Populations in the Gulf of Mexico appear to be much more stable. Overall, it is inferred that this species has undergone declines approaching 30% which are still ongoing, and therefore <em>H. reidi</em> is listed as Near Threatened.","<em>Hippocampus reidi</em> inhabits a variety of coastal habitats and holdfast types, including invertebrates such as bryozoans, sponges, and tunicates, gorgonian corals, seagrasses, estuaries, and especially on macroalgae (often the genus <em>Caulerpa</em>), mangroves (<em>Avicennia shaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa, </em>and<em>&#160;Rhizophora mangle</em>) and on artificial structures such as piers (Dias and Rosa 2003, Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009, Gutiérrez <em>et al. </em>2011, Aylesworth<em> et al.</em> 2015). Vari (1982) reports&#160;<em>H. reidi</em>&#160;at depths as great as 55 m. Small individuals tend to be found in shallower water than large animals (Dauwe 1993). In Brazilian estuaries, <em>H. reidi </em>is commonly found at mean depths lower than 0.40 m (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2007). Indeed, shallow waters, warm temperatures and higher number of mangrove structures could be used to predict seahorse presence in estuarine habitats, as well as calmer waters (Aylesworth <em>et al.</em> 2015). In rocky shores in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, seahorses were mainly found at mean depths of 4.97 m (Oliveira and Freret-Meurer 2012). <em>Hippocampus reidi</em> is mostly found solitary, but mated pairs are common and the species was also recorded to form groups of up to seven individuals (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009).  <br/><br/>The species feeds on crustaceans such as harpacticoid, calanoid, and cyclopoid copepods, caridean shrimps, gammarid and caprellid amphipods, nematodes, and ostracods. Juveniles fed more heavily on hymenopteran insects and mollusk and crustacean eggs, and females relied heavily on caridean shrimps (Felicio <em>et al.</em> 2006, Castro<em> et al.</em> 2008). They are usually sit-and-wait predators but sometimes actively pursue their prey (Felicio <em>et al. </em>2006). <br/><br/>As in other seahorses, this species is ovoviviparous, and the males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). Males matured at 9.5 cm but did not carry embryos until they were 12.4 cm, while mature females were recorded at lengths of 8.8 cm &#160;(Mai and Velasco 2011). A seven month 'resting period' was observed between pregnancies in Rio de Janeiro (Freret-Meurer and Andreata 2008).&#160;<em>Hippocampus reidi</em>&#160;are pair-bonded in the wild (B. Dauwe and M. Nijhoff in litt. to Lourie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007). Reproduction occurs throughout the year but peak reproduction has been recorded from May- November in NE Brazil (Mai and Velasco 2011). Seahorse pairs were re-sighted in estuaries in Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte states, Brazil (Dias and Rosa 2003, Mai and Rosa 2009), and site fidelity and small home ranges reported in Brazil and in Cuba (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009, Mai and Velasco 2011, Hernández <em>et al.</em> 2016) suggest a monogamous sexual pattern. <br/><br/>The von Bertalanffy growth constant (k) was estimated at 1.195/yr and natural mortality ranged from 1.43 to 1.58/yr. Survival was calculated to be between 21% and 24%. Lifespan was estimated to be 2.5 years (Mai and Velasco 2011).<br/><br/>It was suggested that the availability of holdfasts could influence the spatial distribution of these seahorses (Dias and Rosa 2003, Aylesworth <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;The feeding behaviour of 57 specimens was recorded from May 2003 to September 2004 in estuarine habitats (Felicio <em>et al.</em> 2006) and 90 specimens had their activity rate evaluated at a rocky shore in SE Brazil, where pregnant males were found less active in relation to females and non-pregnant males (Freret-Meurer <em>et al</em>. 2012).","<em>Hippocampus reidi</em>&#160;is threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and artisanal fisheries (e.g. Branco<em> et al.</em> 2015). It is also heavily targeted for the aquarium trade, where fishers have reported substantial declines (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species may also be suffering as a result of mangrove, coral and seagrass habitat degradation and loss (Karnauskas<em> et al</em>. 2013, Jackson <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;                    Particularly, it is potentially susceptible to habitat degradation due to its strong relationship with mangrove structures (Aylesworth <em>et al</em>. 2015).     Experiments show that crude oil and hypoxia events in the Gulf of Mexico result in DNA damage and detrimental morphological functioning of <em>H. reidi</em>, but population impacts are not known (Negreiros<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>This species is considered threatened in the United States by the American Fisheries Society (Musick <em>et al</em>. 2000). They cite the species' rarity and degradation of its seagrass habitats in South Florida as reasons for this listing.&#160;                    Moreover,&#160;<em>H. reidi </em>is considered Vulnerable in Venezuela (Ron <em>et al</em>. 2015), Colombia (Ministerio de Ambiente, Vivienda y Desarrollo Territorial, 2010) and Brazil (IBAMA 2014). In the latter, the species is also listed as vulnerable in red lists of four states (Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná and Santa Catarina); in São Paulo, it is considered a species in need of fisheries management and policies for its conservation. In Mexico, it is listed on Mexico’s NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001 as a species subject to special protection.","During Project Seahorse trade surveys conducted between 2000–2001, fishers in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama reported decreases in the catch of seahorses in general both in trawls (as bycatch) and by divers (J. Baum and I. Rosa, unpublished data), but the portion of these declines attributable to <em>H. reidi</em> is unknown. <br/><br/>From October 2005 to September 2006, monthly samplings were carried out at the Mamanguape estuary, State of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil and a total of 280 seahorses were sampled (Castro<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008); at the Camurupim/Cardoso estuary, Piauí, NE Brazil, 647 specimens were sampled (Mai and Rosa 2009); and at twelve Brazilian locations, 911 specimens were recorded from 2002 to 2006. <br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9d2-2cfe-ea7d-35ee2e6b30fe""><span>  <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9d2-2cfe-ea7d-35ee2e6b30fe""><span><p>In Brazilian estuaries, <em>H. reidi </em>presented a mean density of 0.026 specimens/m², ranging from 0.0023-0.066 specimens/m² at sampled localities from 2002 to 2006 (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009). Lower densities were found at localities where trade was recorded (mean 0.013 specimens/m²) than in locations where no trade took place (mean 0.04 specimens/m²) (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2007). At rocky shores in Rio de Janeiro state, mean densities could vary from 0.001 to 0.04 specimens/m²&#160;(Freret-Meurer and Andreata 2008, Oliveira and Freret-Meurer 2012). From December 2002 to November 2004 the population density of <em>H. reidi</em>&#160;at Araçatiba beach, which is in an Environmental Protection Area at Ilha Grande in Rio de Janeiro, significantly decreased during the two years of study. The difference in density during each month in the first and second year was more than half in most months (Freret-Meurer and Andreata 2008). <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9d2-2cfe-ea7d-35ee2e6b30fe""><span>Declines  were reported by fishermen in several localities in at least five NE  Brazilian states; in some localities, declines could reach up to 90%  over the course of a decade (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2011).

Robertson pers. comm. 2014). Its depth range is 0-55 m (Vari 1982).","<em>Hippocampus reidi </em>is retained as bycatch in industrial trawl fisheries and in artisanal small-scale fisheries, and is sometimes targeted live by divers for aquarium trade.<em>&#160;</em>It&#160;is one of the most widely held species of <em>Hippocampus</em> in public aquaria and is one of the most sought after seahorses in the international aquarium trade&#160;(Castro <em>et al. </em>2008). The numbers of aquarium trade&#160;<em>Hippocampus reidi&#160;</em>that were traded internationally and recorded in the CITES trade database are 148,766 to 317,522 from captivity, 20,478 to 22-662 from the wild, and 2,476 from unknown origins (Koldewey and Martin-Smith 2010, Rosa <em>et al. </em>2011). Between 2010 and 2014 annual reported export levels of <em>H. reidi</em> levelled off at just over 10 000 specimens (CITES 2016). Levels of domestic trade are unknown for most of the species' range. <br/><br/>Data from Brazil indicate that                           daily catches of live seahorses for the aquarium trade from January 1997–April 2004 led to an estimate of 715,000 live <em>H. reidi</em> that could be caught from wild populations annually in Brazil in that period (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2011). Colourful (orange, yellow and red) specimens reached the highest prices; from 1997 to 2005, fishers were paid for a coloured seahorse a mean of US$1.23, while black and brown specimens had a mean price of US$1.04; coloured seahorses retail mean price was US$12.27, and dark coloured US$9.64 (Rosa et al. 2011).       Daily catches of live seahorses for the aquarium trade in Brazil from January/1997–April/2004 led to an estimate of 715,000 live H. reidi that could be caught from wild populations annually in Brazil in that period (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). Colourful (orange, yellow and red) specimens reached the highest prices; from 1997 to 2005, fishers were paid for a coloured seahorse a mean of US$1.23, while black and brown specimens had a mean price of US$1.04; coloured seahorses retail mean price was US$12.27, and dark coloured US$9.64 (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). <br/>              <p>The dried seahorse trade has no formal records in Brazil. Domestic trade data are available from interviews (n = 92) conducted with fishers and end-sellers from 2002 to 2009 (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2011). The main source of dried <em>H. reidi </em>seahorses was the non-industrial bycatch in N-NE Brazil; trade volumes were estimated at a mean of 29.7 seahorses sold per month per trader, and a mean of 356.4 dried seahorses sold annually per trader (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>Dried seahorses were usually sold unadorned or as key chains. Occasionally some of them were sold as jewelry, shell crafts with shells and sea stars, or as 'dragons' with wings and eyes attached. These dried seahorses were sometimes ground and consumed in a drink as folk medicine to treat almost 30 diseases and health conditions (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2013), including asthma, bronchitis, gastritis, baldness, wounds, and tuberculosis (Baum and Vincent 2005; Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013; El Deir&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Chinese populations in Panama and Peru sold seahorses commercially as medicine, for use as TCM.                     Dried seahorses have also been sold in Brazil for magic-religious purposes, in the form of “seahorse perfume” and amulets (called “pautás”), used to bring protection, good luck and to avoid evil eye, and also to attract emotional and financial success (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2012).    <br/><br/>The live seahorses were traded as aquarium fishes. Also, in some countries, including Honduras and Costa Rica, they have&#160;<em>in situ </em>value because dive masters would take tourists to particular sites where these seahorses were located (Baum and Vincent 2005).&#160;                    In Brazil, this activity is unregulated and performed in at least three NE states (Piauí, Ceará and Pernambuco), under the name of “passeio do cavalo-marinho”, in which seahorses are captured by “guides” and displayed for tourists in plastic or glass jars. There is no scientific impact assessment of this activity in the country (Ministério do Meio Ambiente 2011).     <br/><br/>Levels of overall offtake from wild populations are unknown, but are thought to number at least in the 10s of thousands. The magnitude of the impacts of this use and trade on wild populations is not known.",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Hippocampus reidi</em>. The entire genus <em>Hippocampus</em> was listed on Appendix II of CITES in 2004. In Mexico, it is listed on Mexico’s NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001 as a species subject to special protection. Permits or licenses are required to export dried syngnathids from Honduras and Nicaragua, and to export live syngnathids from Panama, Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua. In Brazil, other general measures that may benefit seahorses include a marine ornamental fishes Trade Database, the delimitation of specific airports through which wildlife can be exported, and the publication of an illustrated handbook of marine ornamental fishes by IBAMA (Sampaio and Nottingham 2008).

It is relatively widespread in the western Atlantic from Bermuda through south Florida, the Bahamas and the Caribbean to Venezuela. It is naturally rare, a characteristic that is shared by other large-bodied labrids. It achieves high densities only in areas that are protected from exploitation and habitat degradation, with highest densities recorded in areas that have long been protected from exploitation (e.g., Bermuda, Bonaire and Los Roques). There have been significant decreases in species densities recorded over a gradient of fishing pressure, human densities and presence or absence of species protection through marine reserves. Densities of large-bodied parrotfish are 10-fold lower in areas where fishing is present than in areas where fishing is restricted (Debrot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Scarus guacamaia</span> has experienced significant historical declines. In most of its range, this species is still fished, but given its current and natural rarity it is not often caught. This species is also threatened by the continued loss of coral reef and mangrove habitat from coastal development and extraction. Based on anecdotal information from Glovers Reef in the Caribbean (D.

In addition to the impacts of exploitation, this species utilizes habitats that are increasingly impacted and have experienced significant loss in the last 20–30 years. Although significant declines have been reported, the lack of adequate historical population data combined with the rarity of current sightings and subsequent difficulty in coordinating efforts to determine its current population size has resulted in the inability to effectively quantify population declines over time. Moreover, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. guacamaia</span> appears to be conservation dependent with recorded densities highest only in areas where protection is present. It is therefore listed as Near Threatened at the very minimum because cessation of conservation measures could result in this species qualifying for one of the threatened categories within a period of five years. We recommend further monitoring of this species’ population and habitat status and a comprehensive analysis of the reproductive biology including gonadal studies to confirm estimates of size and age at first maturity, estimates of age and sex-specific growth rates, and mortality estimates. In addition, a more detailed analysis of demographic and abundance data is needed in order to predict population responses to varying rates of fishing pressure.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Scarus guacamaia</span> is the largest parrotfish in the Atlantic (Dorenbosch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, Bellwood and Choat 2011) reaching a maximum size of 1.2 m (Choat<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2006) and a maximum age of 16 years (J.H.

Mangrove wetlands are an important habitat for larval and juvenile stages of this species (Moses 2000). It does not appear to penetrate below the thermocline, and occurs in inshore waters adjacent to sandy beaches.

Generation length is conservatively estimated to be approximately four years.<br/><strong><br/></strong><u>Family Polynemidae</u><br/>Polynemids are epibenthic fishes which occur on sandy or muddy bottoms in coastal waters and estuaries. Juveniles are found in seagrass beds or tidepools. As major predators of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, most polynemids feed on a variety of fishes and crustaceans. The pectoral fins of polynemids are divided into an upper part, with rays joined by membrane, and a lower part with four to 11 separate rays, which are thought to act as a sense organ to be used for searching for food in turbid waters. Most polynemids are protandrous. Information on &#160;the larval&#160;development&#160;of polynemids is minimal. Eggs are spherical and pelagic. Polynemids are commercially important in the eastern central Atlantic. The annual catch of polynemids from the area averaged about 39,000 tonnes in the period from 2000 to 2006. There are 43 species in eight genera recognized worldwide (Motomura in press).","<em>Galeoides decadactylus </em>appears to be managed as two stocks in the eastern Atlantic Ocean&#160;(CECAF 2012).<strong>&#160;</strong>In 2011,<em>&#160;</em>the Demersal Species Working Group - CECAF South, considered&#160;<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em>&#160;stocks to be over-exploited in the region, particularly in the following West African Nations: Cote de Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola (CECAF 2012). In Togo, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Benin, both adults and juveniles are taken in the fishery year-around. In Togo, it is taken at depths ranging from eight to 20 meters, in the coastal zone within three nautical miles of the coast (FIRMS 2012-2013). As of 2004, the&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em> stock shared between Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia were also were also considered to be over-exploited (FIRMS 2000-2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Stocks of demersal fishes, including&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em>, which are available to artisanal fisheries were seriously depleted between 1984 and 1987, underwent a slight recovery between 1988 and 1991, and are still considered to be in a depressed state in Nigeria (Moses 2000). <em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is also taken as by-catch in the commercial octopus fishery operating off the coast of Guinea (FIRMS 2012-2013).&#160;The best model (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin) was considered to be overexploited with an Bcurrent/B0.1 of 825%, and Fcurrent/F0.1 is 20%.<br/><strong><br/></strong>Mangroves are an important habitat for larval and juvenile <em>G. decadactylus. </em>In Nigeria,<em>&#160;</em>large tracts of mangrove are being lost through oil pollution, felling by local communities for fuelwood and building materials and clearing by the oil companies to make way for well location, oil pipelines and flow stations. Additionally, the exotic palm <em>Nypa fruticans</em> is rapidly replacing native mangroves (Moses 2000).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><u><br/></u>Additionally, the targeting of juvenile fishes and by-catch of finfish from shrimp trawls are serious management problems in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone, and this is likely the case in other parts of West Africa (Baio 2010). <br/><br/>This species used to be abundant, but is now considered uncommon in many parts of its range.&#160;In Ghana, it is reported in mixed-species Threadfin catch and in 2009 combined threatfin species catch in artisanal species 1,857 tonnes. It is taken in a wide variety of fisheries, with the beach seine representing the largest catch of mixed-species threadfin.","This species is considered to be very common and is likely the most common species of this family. &#160;FAO landings of <em>G. decadactylus </em>are reported from the following West African nations, in order of increasing reported landings in 2011: Mauritania (81 tonnes), Togo, Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Gabon, Cote D'Ivoire,&#160;Liberia, the Republic of Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria (4,524 tonnes). Total landings of <em>G. decadactylus</em> have increased continually, with minor fluctuations, from 1950 to the present. In 2011, the total catch for this species was&#160;18,557 tonnes. In the last 10 years, landings have increased by 8%.<br/><br/>The abundance of&#160;<em>G. decadactylus&#160;</em>varies seasonally by depth. The species is more abundant in the dry season in coastal zones at depths ranging from 5-15 meters, and at depths of 15-40 m during the wet season (Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><br/><u>Model stock assessments</u><br/>In Guinea, annual catches of <em>G. decadactylus </em>increased from 992 tonnes to 1,824 tonnes over the time span of 1995 to 1999, with the large majority of catches&#160;coming&#160;from the industrial rather than the artisanal fishery. Depending on the model used and the location, global evaluations of the stock based on catch/effort/abundance information was considered fully exploited or overexploited by the end of the time series (calculated value of mf<sub> </sub>MSY&#160;=0.9 or 1.4 in Guinea; 0.4 in Senegal, 0.6 or 1.4 in Cape Verde). Annual indices of abundance have&#160;deceased&#160;from 1985 to 1994 in Guinea. Fishing effort, which was calculated as the ratio of captures over indices of abundance, have increased from 1985 (0.35) to 1999 (7.04). A rapid depletion (70% decline) of biomass of five indicator species (including<em> G. decadactylus</em>,<em> Pseudotolithus elongatus</em>, <em>Pseudotolighus typus</em>, <em>Pseudotolightus senegalensis</em>&#160;and <em>Arius </em>spp.) was seen&#160;corresponding&#160;to increasing effort (doubling every three years in&#160;Guinea; Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> was found to be low in relative abundance in beach seine landings taken in various coastal locations off central Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn and Sackey-Mensah 2012). Artisanal fishery production of <em>G. decadactylus</em> has increased from 2002-2006, with a 2,500.2% increase in production from 39.5 tonnes to 425.4 tonnes from 2002-2004, and a 87.8% increase in production from 1,025.8-1,926.0 from 2004-2006 (Baio 2010).<br/><br/><u>Trends in demersal fisheries off the continental shelf of Mauritania<br/></u>The fisheries of the northwestern African continental shelf have developed over the past several decades from low levels of fishing to intense exploitation, leading to severe decreases in biomass and serious signs of over-exploitation. In general, the abundance of demersal resources of northwest Africa has declined by a factor of four over the past 20 to 30 years. Although this species is not a component of fisheries in Mauritania, many trends in Mauritania are reflective of those in Senegal and Guinea. Over the Mauritanian continental shelf, reductions in biomass of up to 75% have been recorded. Using data from scientific surveys conducted in Mauritanian waters, trends in species biomass were&#160;modelled&#160;for 24 taxa, 15 of which showed significant decreasing trends, and only one of which showed increases in abundance. In Senegal and Guinea, abundance indices for this species have remained low, with shallow declines from 1985-1999 (Gascuel<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, CPUE for this species from 1990 to 2010 is fluctuating but relatively stable (Williams pers. comm. 2013). Length at age one is 18 cm, age two is 23 cm, age three is 27, and length&#160;infinity&#160;is 54 cm in Nigeria (Abohweyere 1989).<br/>In the ISTAM database from 1965 to 1998, mean sizes have decreased from 0.4 kg to around 0.1-0.2 kg in 1998.<br/><br/>From 1985-1995, based on indices of abundance, this species declined and then started to increase until 2002 (Sidibe pers comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Mauritania, from 2000 -2001, landings from scientific surveys are fluctuating from 29 metric tonnes in 2000 to a high of 93 metric tonnes in 2008, and a decline to 10 metric tonnes in 2011 (Camara pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Senegal, there has been no observed decrease in juveniles in studies since 2003 (Morais pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Ghana, this species is very scarce in markets, and it used to be more abundant. &#160;However, it is still considered common in Senegal and Nigeria. &#160;It is not that abundant in markets in&#160;Mauritania.",Unknown,"<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is distributed from Morocco to Angola on the west coast of Africa, and also rarely occurs in Algeria, northern Africa and Namibia, southern Africa.

It generally only occurs between the Canary Islands and Angola.","<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em>&#160;is an important component of the commercial trawl fishery in eastern Atlantic, constituting between 10 and 20% of the total landings by weight. The annual catch from the area averaged 15,600 tonnes from 2000-2006, mainly caught by Nigeria, Ghana, and Gabon (Motomura in press). It is a major coastal resource in Senegal.

44016720,161551,Deania profundorum,Near Threatened,A2d,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Arrowhead Dogfish (<em>Deania profundorum</em>) is a small (to 97 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a patchy distribution in the East Atlantic (Western Sahara to South Africa), West Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean), and the Indo-west Pacific.&#160;It occurs on continental and insular slopes at depths of&#160;205–1,800 m. The species is&#160;caught as both targeted and incidental catch in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries&#160;operating across most its known range, but the species is likely to find refuge at depth. A number of management measures were implemented&#160;for deep-water sharks&#160;in recent years, both species-specific and more generally.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but increasing trends in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Arrowhead Dogfish is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (90 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Arrowhead Dogfish has been recorded from continental and insular slopes at depths of&#160;205–1,800 m (Weigmann, 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 97 cm total length (TL); males mature at 43–67 cm TL; females mature at 62–80 cm TL (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 5–7 pups and size-at-birth is &gt;31 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology.&#160;Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, the Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>), which has a female age-at-maturity of 21.5 years and a maximum age of 37 years, resulting in a generation length of 30 years (Irvine <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;However, the Birdbeak Dogfish is larger than the Arrowhead Dogfish (120 cm vs 97 cm TL) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.","<p>The Arrowhead Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. <br/><br/><em>Deania&#160;</em>spp were previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). At-vessel-mortality is high, and post-release mortality is also likely to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello&#160;and Sanchez&#160;2017).&#160;In the Northwest Atlantic, there is limited deep-water fishing effort. In the US Gulf of Mexico, Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing; deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported in logbooks (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). In the South African Hake fishery,&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp made up &lt;0.2% of the total catch&#160;with a reported 126 t landed between 2010–<a>2018 (MSC 2020).&#160;</a>There is currently no deep-water fishing where the species occurs off Oman and the Gulf of Aden.<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, the species is also taken as bycatch in deep-water shrimp trawl fisheries that operate off western India (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). This fishery&#160;developed in 1999 and after rapid expansion and rapid decline in effort, the fleet is high at 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez<em>&#160;et al. </em>2015). Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>In the Pacific Ocean, deep-water dogfish fisheries date back to the 1960s (Flores 2004). These fisheries use demersal longline gear to primarily targeting&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, but likely catch <em>Deania </em>spp on occasion (LAMAVE 2017). These fisheries are known for their boom-and-bust nature, given the lack of management, and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before moving onto new areas (Flores 2004). Like many of the world's fisheries, over the past 30 years in Taiwan, the deep-water trawl fishery has moved to deeper waters; operations at 300–700 m for most of the year and would encounter this species. However, there is some refuge at depth beyond 700 m and during the monsoon season when the fishery operates at shallow depths. There has been a noted increase in landing rates in Taiwan since 2013, that could partly be accounted for by the increased fishing depth, although that has been occurring for the past 30 years with the increase in landings only noted in the past six years, and improvements in reporting can not be ruled out.&#160;Any&#160;<em>Deania</em>&#160;spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p>","Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of dogfishes, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp).<br/><br/>Industrial landings of&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp, including both the Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>) and the Arrowhead Dogfish (primarily Birdbeak Dogfish) in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters&#160;peaked at ~195 t in 2004–05, before rapidly declining to 3 t by 2010 due to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp were often the most abundant deep-water shark in research surveys (ICES-WGEF 2018). Relative abundance estimates of&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp (Birdbeak Dogfish,&#160;<em>Deania calcea</em>, and Arrowhead Dogfish) from Spanish and Scottish trawl survey series suggest contrasting but stable trends since 1983 and 1998, respectively (ICES-WGEF 2018). In the Gulf of Mexico, trends are likely to be stable based on the lack of deep-water fishing in the region.<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Arrowhead Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations&#160;(90 years). Importantly, causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and the likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).<br/><br/>Estimating mortality and changes in&#160;catch rates&#160;of this species&#160;is difficult in the NW Pacific.&#160;The liver of this species may be utilised&#160;and/or exported, and annual export data can be used to ascertain changes to the interactions.&#160;Annual exports of shark liver oil from the Philippines peaked at 336 t in 1980 to 45 t in 1993 (BFAR 2017), although there is&#160;no&#160;data available on species composition.&#160;Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s (Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao&#160;et al.&#160;2019), with industrial effort declining&#160;after&#160;1990. Landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;et al.&#160;2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to&#160;represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.&#160;<a style="""">This represents a 65% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (90 years) for the Arrowhead Dogfish, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible&#160;levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.</a><br/><br/>Across the regions, the Arrowhead Dogfish&#160;was inferred to be stable in the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic and have declined in West Africa and the Northwest Pacific. Due to estimated declines in parts of its range, high levels of exploitation, a global population reduction of 20–29% was inferred over three generation lengths (90 years). Therefore, the Arrowhead Dogfish is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).",Decreasing,"The Arrowhead Dogfish has a patchy distribution in the East Atlantic (Western Sahara to South Africa), West Atlantic (Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean), and the Indo-west Pacific (South Africa, Gulf of Aden, Philippines) Oceans (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013).","Historically, this species has been utilised for its flesh and liver oil. Fins from <em>Deania </em>spp have been reported&#160;in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Arrowhead Dogfish, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016).&#160;Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Arrowhead Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus</em> spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

South Atlantic recreational headboat landings declined by 70% from 675 individuals in 1983 to 200 individuals in 2002 and catch per unit effort declined by 33% from 0.015 in 1995 to 0.010 in 2002. However, this does not equivocate to a true decline in abundance since stringent regulations went into place in the South Atlantic in 1994 which limited the headboat vessels to one Warsaw grouper per vessel per trip and commercial sale was prohibited, and since 2011, there has been a total prohibition on take of this species (SEDAR4 2004, Farmer and Karnauskas 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico:</strong>&#160;In the southern Gulf of Mexico, off the Yucatan Peninsula, this species is captured in the grouper fishery that primarily targets Red Grouper (<em>Epinephelus morio</em>). Landings are recorded under the common name of “Fiat”, and it occurs in the catch relatively rarely probably because the main fishing grounds of the Campeche Bank is shallower than its typical preferred depth range. Incidental catch of <em>H. nigritus</em> occurs when the commercial bottom long-line fishery fishes the edge of the Campeche Bank. Although the fishery authority in Mexico (CONAPESCA) collects fishery records under the common name, no formal assessment has been undertaken, so its status is mostly unknown in Mexican waters. The limited data available via the Centro de Investigaciones Pesqueras of Yucatan for 23 specimens captured by the commercial longline fishery had fork lengths ranging from 57 to 94 cm and an average of 76 cm and weight ranged from 2.6 to 12 kg with an average of 6.6 kg.<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>In eastern Brazil,&#160;this species&#160;was relatively unknown by interviewed fishermen (N = 53), although older fishermen recognized it as a species they had captured more frequently in the past (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2013). Little data are available from Brazil, and its status is not well-understood.&#160;</p>",Unknown,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from Bermuda, Virginia south along the U.S., in the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba and the Florida Keys north along the Gulf coast to southern Texas and off Mexico from Tuxpan to Alacranes Reef. In the Caribbean, it occurs from Cuba, Hispaniola, the Gulf of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago and then south to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its depth range is 25 to 525 metres (Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). There are also records from Barbados, western Honduras and Colombia (Bustos-Montes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).","This species supports commercial fisheries in several parts of its range. It is caught in U.S. commercial fisheries, and taken as bycatch in Tilefish fisheries.&#160;In the southern Gulf of Mexico off the Yucatan Peninsula, this species&#160;is captured and taken as part of the Mexican grouper fishery that is mostly comprised of the Red Grouper (<em>Epinephelus morio)</em>&#160;when the commercial bottom long-line fleet fishes the edge of the Campeche Bank. It&#160;is primarily caught by hook and line and bottom longlines and incidentally in deepwater snapper/grouper fisheries.",Marine,"<p>Half of the global population of this species occurs in U.S. waters, and fishing on about 40 to 50% of this population is currently prohibited (South Atlantic) with the remainder under stringent catch restrictions (Gulf of Mexico). In the U.S. South Atlantic, stringent fishing regulations were implemented in 1994 which limited the headboat vessels to one Warsaw Grouper per vessel per trip and commercial sale was prohibited, and since 2011, there has been a total prohibition on take of this species. In addition, eight deepwater marine protected areas (MPAs) were implemented in 2009 in part to reduce bycatch of Warsaw Grouper (Farmer and Karnauskas 2013).&#160;In U.S. waters of the&#160;<span style="""">Gulf of Mexico</span><span style="""">,</span>&#160;there is a bag limit for recreational fishers and a quota for the commercial fishery.

This species may benefit from the fishing ban off the Yucatan Peninsula that occurs annually in February for all grouper species. However, the spawning season of this species probably does not take place during this time in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and therefore, may still be susceptible to fishing pressure during spawning.

It is exploited by recreational and commercial fisheries, and spawning aggregations are heavily targeted in some areas. Due to overexploitation, large declines in catch and spawning aggregation size have been documented in Cuba (80% since 1980), Bermuda (past), the U.S. Virgin Islands (30-50% since the 1990s), Puerto Rico (93% landings decline since 2000), Mexico (possibly up to 50% since 1984) and Brazil (anecdotal). Declines are also likely elsewhere in countries with active grouper fisheries, but data are limited. Conservation measures are in place in a few areas, but overall, protection from fishing remains insufficient. Therefore, this species is suspected to have undergone global-level declines of nearly 30%, or possibly more, since 1980, which is a time period covering the past two generation lengths (36 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (18 years) due to no anticipated changes in exploitation rates or management efforts. It is listed as Near Threatened since it nearly meets the thresholds for Vulnerable A4bd.&#160;Improvements in fisheries monitoring and management are needed as well as protection of spawning aggregation sites.","Adults of this species inhabit rocky and coral reefs, while juveniles occur in shallow turtle grass beds. Its maximum total length is 100 cm and females reach maturity around 51 cm length and 4.6 years of age (Garcia<em> et al</em>. 1994, SEDAR14 2007, Cushion 2010). It is a protogynous hermaphrodite&#160;and fork length at sex transition is about 80.2 cm (Kadison&#160;<em>et. al.</em>&#160;2011, Caballero-Arango 2013,&#160;Brule&#160;<em>et. al.</em>&#160;2016). This species has been&#160;aged up to 31 years and estimated natural mortality was 0.14 (Burton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). It forms seasonal spawning aggregations.&#160;Spawning takes place in Bermuda in July and in the Florida Keys in March (at least formerly, but not confirmed recently), and on the Florida Middle Grounds in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from March to August (Bullock and Smith 1991, Heemstra and Randall 1993). Spawning in Cuba occurs in January/February and April/May (García-Cagide and García 1996). Spawning on Grammanik Bank south of&#160;St. Thomas occurs from February-April (Kadison <em>et. al.</em> 2011). In the southern Gulf of Mexico on the Campeche Bank, spawning occurs at 28-29 metres depth at Bajos del Norte Reef from March-May (Caballero-Arango 2013, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). Evidence of spawning behaviour has also been recorded off&#160; Puerto Rico (Sadovy <em>et al.</em> 1994, Matos-Caraballo and Posada 2000, White <em>et al</em>. 2002, Matos-Caraballo<em> et al.</em> 2006, Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schärer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Schärer <em>et al.</em> 2012), Belize (Sala<em> et al.</em> 2001, Heyman and Kjerfve 2008), Cuba (Claro and Lindeman 2003), the U.S. Virgin Islands (Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2009), Colombia (Hooker <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Venezuela (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on a longevity of 31 years, age at first maturity of 5 years, and applying the formula for a hermaphroditic fish in Depczynski<em> et al.</em> (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 18 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species. It is especially impacted by fishers targeting spawning aggregations (Claro and Lindeman 2003).&#160;This species has been identified in the diet of the invasive Lionfish, but only juveniles are consumed (Villasenor-Derbez and Herrera-Perez 2014).","In some areas, populations of this species are suggested to have been historically large (Heemstra and Randall 1993), but current populations are considerably reduced, especially due to intense exploitation on spawning aggregations. Species-specific fisheries data are limited. Overall, this species is suspected to have undergone global-level declines of nearly 30%, or possibly more, since 1980, which is a time period covering the past two generation lengths (36 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (18 years) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure.<br/><br/><strong>Bermuda:</strong> In Bermuda, landings of <em>Mycteroperca venenosa</em> declined in the 1970s and 1980s, and since conservation measures were put in place to reduce fishing effort, there has been some improvement in its population (Luckhurst 1996). <br/><br/><strong>United States (continental): </strong>In the continental U.S., commercial landings of this species have been relatively low since it first appeared in official statistics in 1984. Landings in the Atlantic states have been stable at an average of 1.6 metric tonnes per year over the entire time period (1984-2015), and landings in the Gulf of Mexico states peaked at 186 mt in 1986, declined thereafter, and have remained stable at an average of 1.5 mt per year from 1992 to 2016 (NMFS database <a href=""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). Declines in catches are likely due to fishery regulations that reduced effort.<br/><br/><strong>U.S. Caribbean: </strong>Prior to the 1990s, this species was not heavily targeted in the northern U.S. Virgin Islands due to some limited ciguatera poisoning. Targeted effort increased in the 1990s to supply the expanding restaurant market, and as a result, between 2000-2004 spawning aggregations of <em>Mycteroperca venenosa</em> and <em>Epinephelus striatus</em> were reduced by about 30-50%. In 2004, the total spawning population of <em>M. venenosa</em> on Grammanik Bank was 900 individuals (Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2006). After years of heavy exploitation on Grammanik Bank, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council closed the area to all fishing during the spawning season of <em>M. venenosa</em> and <em>E. striatus</em> (February-May) in 2005 (Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2011), and some level of recovery has been observed. In Puerto Rico, landings of this species were not recorded until 1998, and over the 13 year period of 1998-2011, landings declined from a high of 11,208 lbs in 2000 to 802 lbs in 2011, which represents a 93% decline over a 11 year period (Matos-Caraballo 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Cuba: </strong>This species is common, but not abundant in Cuba. It is targeted by Cuban fisheries, including spawning aggregations, and there has been a more than 80% decline in landings since 1980 (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). All spawning aggregation sites of <em>M. venenosa</em> on the Cuban shelf have declined (Claro and Lindeman 2003). Across the four main fishing zones of Cuba, landings declined from about 35 tonnes in 1981 to about 6 tonnes in 2012, which represents about an 82% decline in 31 years (S. Valle pers. comm. 2018). This has not been an abundant species in the fishery.<br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>In Mexico, at least 18 grouper species are commercially exploited by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets through a sequential fishing operation pattern: the Mexican inshore, artisanal or small-scale fishery targets juveniles, and the Mexican and Cuban offshore fishery mainly targets adults. The fishery operates mainly in the southern Gulf of Mexico on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76%) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). The most important species by catch number and weight is <em>Epinephelus morio</em>, followed by <em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em> and <em>M. microlepis</em> for the Mexican inshore fleet, and by <em>M. bonaci</em>, <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> and <em>M. microplepis</em> for the Mexican offshore fleet (Colás-Marrufo <em>et al</em>. 1998, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Mexican grouper fishery is in an overall state of decline; over the past 28 years (1984 to 2012), the average catch per unit effort (CPUE; kg per fishing trip) of the high-value Mexican offshore grouper fishery declined by 51% (2,800 kg/trip between 1984 and 1990, 1,800 kg/trip between 1991 and 1995, and 1,400 kg/trip between 1996 and 2008). The Cuban fleet recorded a 66% decline in average CPUE over a period of 18 years (1984-2002; 6 kg per 100 hooks for the period from 1984-1990 and then declined to 2 kg per 100 hook for the period from 1999-2002). The population of this species on the Campeche Bank remains poorly known (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). Off Yucatan, M. venenosa is primarily targeted by commercial fisheries operating on coral reefs of the Campeche Bank such as Alacranes, Bajos del Norte and Cayo Arenas, and frequently during the time when the species forms spawning aggregations there (Colás-Marrufo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004, 2006, Tuz-Sulub 2008, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). As a result, some spawning aggregations have been severely reduced or are near extirpation (Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2012). At Bajos del Norte Reef, grouper catch by the offshore Mexican fleet reached a total of 2,435 kg over 10 fishing days in February 2001 (average 244 kg/day), and the most abundant species in the catch were <em>M. venenosa</em>, <em>E. guttatus</em>, <em>M. tigris</em> and <em>M. bonaci</em>. At the same reef, <em>M. venenosa</em> catch was 2,254 kg, 1,617 kg and 2,231 kg over 12 fishing days in March 2002 (average 188 kg/day), over 10 fishing days in May 2002 the average was 162 kg/day and in March-April 2004, the average was 223 kg/day (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2003, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). At Cayo Arenas Reef, <em>M. venenosa</em> catch was 580 kg and 450 kg over 14 fishing days in April-May 2004 (average 41 kg/day), and in May-June 2004, catch averaged 28 kg/day over 16 fishing days (Tuz-Sulub 2008). Sizes of <em>M. venenosa</em> individuals (32.5-98.5 cm fork length; n = 1,383) collected at Bajos del Norte by Caballero-Arango (2013) in 2008-2009 were similar to those observed at the same reef by Tuz-Sulub (2008) and Tuz-Sulub and Brulé (2015) in 2001-2004 (41.5-89.4 total length; n = 426). Two <em>M. venenosa</em> individuals of total lengths 85 and 92 cm were collected in 2004 at Cayo Arenas Reef (Tuz-Sulub <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>Species-specific landings are not available from Brazil. All groupers are lumped in official landings data, with species in the genus Mycteroperca recorded under the common name ""sirigado“ or “badejo"" until 2010, when official statistics were discontinued (Boletim Estatístico da Pesca e Aquicultura 2011). Some recent data (past 10 years) from different localities report that this species is caught very infrequently (less than 1% of landings) as compared to other species in the snapper-grouper complex. However, <em>M. venenosa</em> is apparently more naturally abundant around islands and seamounts of the Vitoria-Trindade chain. Interviews conducted over the past 15 years with commercial longline fishers operating in the Trindade and Martin Vaz insular complex and the Vitoria–Trindade submarine chain indicated that <em>M. venenosa</em> was rapidly disappearing from the catches in the region (Martins <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pinheiro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""></span>",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from North Carolina south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys north to Alabama, the Flower Garden Banks and surrounding area, and from Tuxpan, Mexico along the Yucatan Peninsula to Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and along South America to French Guiana (H. Espinosa-Perez pers. comm. 2014, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It also occurs off Brazil from Maranhao to Sao Paulo, including Trinidade Island (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013) and the Fernando de Noronha Chain (B.P. Ferreira pers. obs.). Its depth range is 2-137 metres.","This species is taken in recreational and commercial fisheries. In some areas, it is ciguatoxic and not heavily taken for food. Most of the Mexican offshore grouper production is exported to the United States (SAGARPA 2012).",Marine,"Currently, there are no species-specific conservation measures and/or fishing regulation for this species in Brazil. There is a size limit of 32 cm total length or 460 g on catch of this species in Cuba.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Caribbean: </strong>There are no known restrictions on trade in this species in any Caribbean countries. A series of conservation strategies have been proposed to protect the spawning aggregations in the Caribbean region, including area protection of spawning aggregations, implementation of monitoring programmes and restricting fishing gear (Luckhurst 2003). In 2005, the Caribbean Fisheries Management Council closed Grammanik Bank off St. Thomas to fishing during the spawning season to protect this species (Kadison 2011). Also in 2005, an annual seasonal closure was enacted for this species in all waters of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Federal Register Vol. 70, No 208). The combined effect of the seasonal closure of the Grammanik Bank, the 22 year closure of the Marine Conservation District (MCD), a large marine reserve 4 km to the west, and the seasonal ban on harvest or sale of this species, has undoubtedly played a key role in maintaining the spawning population&#160;that currently exists on the bank (Kadison 2011).&#160;In 2002, the Belizean government enacted regulations that halted fishing in 11 traditional offshore spawning areas and established a four-month closed season for grouper fishing (<a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0304_030304_belizefish.html"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0304_030304_belizefish.html</a>).<br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico:</strong>&#160;Off Mexico, a seasonal closure for the grouper fishery from February 15 to March 15 has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA, 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure will be extended from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Further regulations for the Mexican grouper fishery include limitation of commercial fishing permits, gear restrictions and a minimum size limit for certain species (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). Reducing the current fishing effort to levels prevailing in the 1980s has been recommended as well as reducing grouper fishing mortality by 20% within five years. Further research is needed on other species such as <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>, <em>M. bonaci</em> and <em>M. venenosa</em> to determine their population status (SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). It is not known if the seasonal fishery closures have allowed this species to recover, but the closure season provides only partial temporal protection for spawning <em>M. venenosa</em>. The creation of a year-round no-take marine protected area at Bajos del Norte would probably be the most effective measure for protecting grouper populations in that area (Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015).","",,false,false,Global

It occurs solitarily. Juveniles settle in shallow sandy-rocky patch reefs and sometimes occur in estuaries, seagrass and oyster rubble habitat (Keener <em>et al</em>. 1988, Sluka&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Ross and Moser 1995, Renán&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Schwamborn 2004, Renán-Galindo 2005, Rezende unpublished data). As adults age, they move to deeper waters typically with high relief and deeper than 30 metres (SEDAR48 2017). Adults feed primarily on fishes, including grunts, snappers and herrings. Juveniles feed solely on crustaceans. This species forms seasonal feeding (non-spawning) aggregations along the outer shelf of Brazil that coincides with spawning aggregations of certain prey species (Ferreira-Teixeira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, www.ibama.gov.br/cepene). It is a monandric, protogynous hermaphrodite that forms spawning aggregations (Smith 1965, García-Cagide and García 1996, Crabtree and Bullock 1998, Brulé&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Teixeira <em>et al.</em> 2004). It&#160;has been reported to form spawning aggregations in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea (Fine 1990, Carter and Perrine 1994, Domeier and Colin 1997, Eklund <em>et al.</em> 2000). Off Belize, it may spawn in aggregations at the same sites used by the Nassau Grouper (Carter and Perrine 1994). Oliveira and Souza (2016) suggested possible spawning aggregations off Sergipe and north of Bahia in Brazil, while França and Olavo (2015) indicated spawning aggregations off the state of Bahia that may be targeted by fishers. In South Florida, this species has been&#160;aged to at least 33 years and largest recorded total length is 151.8 cm. Growth is relatively rapid for the first ten years and then slows considerably. Age of first maturation is 5.2 years<strong>&#160;</strong>at a size of 82.6 cm, and age at transition is 15.5 years at a length of 121.4 cm&#160;(Crabtree and Bullock 1998). In Brazil (Abrolhos Bank), 50% of females were sexually mature at 76.4 cm total length (Oliviera-Freitas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;In the southern Gulf of Mexico (Campeche Bank), it has been aged to a maximum of 27 years (Renán <em>et al. </em>2013).

Average CPUE was 2,800 kg/fishing trip between 1984 and 1990, 1,800 kg/fishing trip between 1991 and 1995 and 1,400 kg/fishing trip between 1996 and 2008 (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;The <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Cuban fleet, which primarily targets <em>E. morio</em>, recorded a 66% decline in average CPUE over a period of 18 years (1984-2002). In Quintana Roo, the grouper fishery is very important (SAGARPA 2012). From 1960 to 2011 (about 51 years), grouper landings steadily increased and peaked in 1991 (1,065 metric tonnes) and declined thereafter by 62% to 400 mt in 2011 (SAGARPA 2014a).&#160;Part of the Mexican offshore grouper production is exported to the United States (SAGARPA 2012), and between 1990 and 2011, an average of 2,900 mt of grouper were exported annually from Mexico to the USA&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN"">(SAGARPA 2014a). Interviews of fishermen recorded&#160;<em>M. bonaci</em> spawning aggregations at Alacranes Reef on Campeche Bank, and between 1997 and 2000, <em>M. bonaci </em>was the most important grouper (45.5% by weight) in the commercial catch at this reef (Colás-Marrufo<em> et al</em>. 2002,&#160;Aguilar-Perera<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2008, Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2011).

Catches gradually declined from an annual mean of 1,476 tons from 1959 to 1963 to less than 100 t from 1992 to 1998. This was attributed to increases in fishing effort<span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;(Claro <span lang=""EN-IN""><em>et al</em>.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN""> 2001). Landings&#160;in Cuba of this species from 1980 to 2010 declined by more than 80%. Based on visual surveys conducted in 1988 to 2000 in Sabana Camahuey (northeast Cuba), <em>M. bonaci</em>&#160;declined by more than 50% in mangroves and the reef slope (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).</span></span></span></span></span><br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;This species is targeted in U.S. waters by commercial and recreational fisheries, but is not particularly common in fishery catches, especially under the current management regime (SEDAR48 2017). Based on genetic studies, the U.S. stock is managed as a single unit across the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Its U.S. population is centered in south Florida and the Florida Keys and the majority of catch occurs there as well. A stock assessment of the U.S. stock concluded that this species is not overfished and not undergoing overfishing (SEDAR19 2010). Total biomass in the U.S. stock was stable at 6 million pounds from 1986 to 1993 and increased thereafter to 11 million pounds in 2008. Spawning biomass showed a similar pattern, where it was stable at 3.5 million pounds until 1993 when it began to increase to 8.3 million pounds in 2008 (SEDAR19 2010). According to SEDAR48 (2017), uncertainty related to potential confusion between <em>M. bonaci</em> and <em>M. microlepis</em> in landings data has caused a delay in an updated stock assessment for this species, and there are substantial concerns that this issue affects catch data collected since 1986. In the Dry Tortugas (Florida), which is a no-take reserve, this species has increased by 300% over the past 10 years (1999-2011).</span><br/><br/><strong>Bermuda:</strong>&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">This has been an important species in Bermuda’s reef fishery for many years and was taken in large numbers by fish pots and traps in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s (Lavett-Smith 1971). Catch declined from 90,000 lbs/yr to 15,000 lbs/yr in the 1980s due to overfishing (Bannerot<em>&#160;</em><span lang=""EN-IN""><em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;1987). Since 1990, fish pots have been banned, but the lack of data on the status of fish stocks prohibits an understanding of population recovery (Kura<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004 in Trott and Luckhurst 2007).</span></span><br/><br/><strong>Brazil:</strong>&#160;This species was commercially targeted in the Abrolhos region of Brazil along with <em>E. morio </em>until the 1980s when catch declined significantly; by 2000, only 11% of the fleet targeted large groupers such as <em>M. bonaci</em> (Martins <em>et al</em>. 2005). Quantitative data past the year 2008 are very limited for northeast Brazil, but it is suspected that the dramatic declines since the 1980s have continued to the present. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the depleted phase was 1.4 kg/fisher/day (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2003), which was considerably lower than in the late 1970s at 12 kg/day/fisher. More recent landings in Caravelas (Abrolhos region) were comprised mostly of immature individuals (78% of the catch) (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2011). In northeastern Brazil (Ceara to Alagoas), statistics available from Estatpesca from 1993 to 2005 indicated that monthly catches of <em>Mycteroperca </em>species fluctuated with peaks during summer (Teixeira <em>et al.</em> 2004), but the collection of landings statistics was interrupted in 2008. National pooled catches (all states) of the category “badejo”, which corresponds to <em>Mycteroperca </em>species, remained stable from 2009 to 2011. Data on effort is not available, but feeding and spawning aggregations are known to be heavily targeted. Underwater surveys conducted at Abrolhos Bank recorded that <em>M. bonaci</em> comprised 1.5% of the total fish biomass. In the same area, biomass was highest in full protection areas, and population increased significantly&#160;within stringently enforced no-take reserves between 2001 and 2005 (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). Interviews of fishers <span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">with between 10 to 45 years of fishing experience along the northeastern Brazilian coast reported that&#160;the capture of the black grouper has been in decline over the past two decades<span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;(Teixeira&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">&#160;2004)<span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">. Interviews conducted in Porto Seguro, Bahia, which was one of the main fishing areas for this species in the 1980s, indicated that&#160;fishers older than 50 years caught larger fish four decades ago than currently (Bender&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013)<span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN"">.&#160;Underwater surveys conducted by Reef Check Brazil in Abrolhos, Fernando de Noronha, APA Coral Coast, Porto Seguro and Itaparica indicate that in the abundance of this species is generally low, even in strictly protected areas (Ferreira and Maida 2006). Underwater surveys in the fully protected Arvoredo Reserve in southern Brazil reported a higher biomass of <em>M. bonaci</em>&#160;inside the reserve than outside (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2014).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-IN""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span lang=""EN-IN""></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from Cape Canaveral, Florida south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys north to Alabama, the Flower Garden Banks and surrounding area, and from southern Texas south along Mexico to Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Santa Catarina, Brazil, including the Trinidade and Fernando de Noronha Islands (H. Espinosa-Perez and R. Robertson pers. comm. 2014, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It does not occur along northern South America between Paramaribo, Suriname and Maranhao, Brazil. Records further north to Massachusetts (USA) are juveniles and therefore considered waifs. Its depth range is one to 100 metres.</p>","This species is exploited by commercial and recreational fisheries through much of its range. In U.S. waters, it is targeted by commercial longline and handline fisheries as well as recreational headboat and hook-and-line fisheries.",Marine,"<p>In Brazil, this species&#160;is listed under the regulatory instruction Number 5 (IN5) from 21/05/2004 revised in 08/2005 MMA- as overexploited or threatened by overexploitation, but formal fishing regulations are insufficient. In southern and southeastern Brazil, there is a minimum catch size limit of 45 cm (IBAMA 2003).&#160;Currently, the species is protected only in no-take marine protected areas, and no management plan is in place.<br/><br/>Science-based stock assessments are conducted in the U.S. that support the management of this species, and stringent fishery regulations are designed to reduce fishing effort to a sustainable level. It is protected within the Conch Reef Research Only Area (a no-take marine reserve) in the northern Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (Lindholm <em>et al.</em> 2005). <br/><br/>Since 1990 in Bermuda, fish pots have been banned and bag limits, minimum legal size limits and seasonal area closures have been implemented. However, the effectiveness of these measures is unclear due to the lack of sufficient data on the status of fish stocks (Kura<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004 in Trott and Luckhurst 2007).<br/> <br/>In Mexico, an annual month-long seasonal closure of the grouper fishery has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003), and this is now being extended to two months (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, 2003a,b; Caballero-Arango 2013; Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015; SAGARPA 2016). The Mexican grouper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean also includes limiting commercial fishing permits, hook size limits and a minimum size limit (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). There is also a quota in place for the Cuban fleet that fishes Campeche Bank (Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al.</em> 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). It is recommended that no-take protective measures for grouper spawning aggregations at Alacranes Reef be implemented.&#160;No clear data on the effectiveness of seasonal closures are available and it is not known how this and other efforts to reduce fishing effort are enforced. It has been recommended that current fishing effort be reduced to levels in the 1980s, and to also reduce fishing mortality by 20% within five years and improve species-specific fishery data collection&#160;(SAGARPA 2012, 2014a).&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global
46958684,202632,Paralichthys lethostigma,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-06-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Paralichthys lethostigma</em> is widely distributed and&#160;inhabits riverine, coastal and estuarine waters on muddy or  silty substrates. It has an estimated generation length of 5 years.<br/><br/>This species supports major commercial and recreational fisheries in U.S. waters and is managed at the state level in six main areas, but the global population is concentrated in the northern Gulf of Mexico and off North Carolina on the Atlantic coast. There is concern regarding the&#160;uncertainty of the data upon which stock assessments have been constructed in flounder fisheries.&#160;Out of the six U.S. states that monitor the Southern Flounder population in their waters, the most data-intensive population estimates have been conducted by Texas&#160;and North Carolina, which show 30% and 25% declines respectively over the past three generations (15 years).&#160;These declines have been attributed to overexploitation by both the commercial and recreational fishing sectors, as well as bycatch mortality in the shrimp trawl fishery. Three of the states (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana) report stable populations, while the status off Florida is unknown. On average over the past 23 years, Louisiana reported the highest average landings in both the recreational and commercial sectors for the Gulf of Mexico; however, it is not known if one or more states contain a greater proportion of the Gulf population because the last Gulf-wide assessment was inconclusive.&#160;Fisheries are heavily reliant on age-0 and age-1 individuals, a large percentage of which are immature.&#160;In addition, this species exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, with females attaining much larger sizes than males, and females consequently compose the majority of large fishes harvested. In some areas, selective harvesting of females may contribute to skewed sex ratios in the population; the effects of this on the reproductive success are unknown.<br/><br/>This is an estuarine dependent species, and these habitats have been seriously impacted by anthropogenic activities. There are many indications that this species is declining throughout its range, with some signs that stringent management measures implemented in recent years may be allowing populations to recover.<br/><br/>As this species is heavily exploited throughout its range, both directly and incidentally, it is suspected that other populations are likely declining at the same rate. This species nearly meets the thresholds for Vulnerable under criterion A2bd; therefore it is assessed as Near Threatened. The development of a comprehensive Gulf-wide stock assessment may provide a clearer quantitative picture for this species.","This is an estuarine-dependent species that inhabits riverine, estuarine and coastal waters, and prefers muddy or silty substrates (Reagan and Wingo 1985). Individuals can tolerate wide temperature (~5-35°C) and salinity ranges (~0.0-60.0‰), and often enter freshwater. Tagging studies have shown that this species does not typically migrate far distances (Wenner <em>et al</em>. 1990, Monaghan 1992, Scharf <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Life History</strong><br/>This species is sexually dimorphic, with females reaching approximately 80 cm total length (TL) and males reaching about 40 cm TL. Previously, most females (94%) were thought to reach maturity by the end of their second year. In the Atlantic stock, the oldest individual was nine years old (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). In the Gulf of Mexico stock off Louisiana, the oldest recorded female was eight years old and the oldest male was four years old (Fischer and Thompson 2004). Recent histological analysis of ovaries has shown it matures at larger sizes and older ages (Midway and Scharf 2012). In North Carolina, 3%, 44% and 76% of age<sup>-0</sup>, age<sup>-1</sup>, and age<sup>-2</sup> individuals, respectively, were mature (Midway and Scharf 2012). Southern Flounder spawn in offshore waters off the southeast U.S. between November and March (Safrit and Schwartz 1998) and in the Gulf of Mexico from October to February (Reagan and Wingo 1985). The oceanic larval stage is pelagic and lasts 30–60 days. Metamorphosing individuals enter estuaries and migrate towards low-salinity headwaters, where settlement occurs (Burke <em>et al</em>. 1991, Walsh <em>et al</em>. 1999). Juveniles remain in estuaries until the onset of sexual maturation (approximately two years), at which time they migrate out of estuaries to join adults on the inner continental shelf.<br/><br/><strong>Generation Length Calculation</strong><br/>Longevity for fish in Louisiana waters is at least eight years for females and four years for males (Fischer and Thompson 2004) and age at 50% maturity is likely around two years old. Thus, generation length is estimated at 3.5–5 years; five years was used for the purposes of this assessment.","Fishing pressure, including incidental catch, is a factor in population reductions of this species, but simultaneous declines across its entire range suggests that&#160;broad-scale oceanographic mechanisms may also be contributing (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species is estuarine-dependent, and may be susceptible to anthropogenic activities occurring in these areas.&#160;It&#160;is taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls in the same areas it is also directly targeted by fishermen. It also occurs as bycatch in crab pots and crab trawls in North Carolina (Brown 2009,&#160;Smith and Scharf 2010)<em>.</em>&#160;<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>","<strong>Atlantic Population</strong><u><strong><br/></strong></u><em><strong>North Carolina</strong></em>: As of 2004, the largest fishery for <em>P. lethostigma</em> was in North Carolina, where it has been a major component of the commercial fishing industry in estuarine waters for nearly three decades. It is considered a unit stock (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). Stock assessments are performed under the management of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). Commercial landings accounted for about 89% of the total annual harvest from 1991 to 2007, but declined to 72%-76% from 2004 to 2007. Recreational harvest accounted for an average of 11% of the total annual harvest from 1991 to 2007, but increased to 24%-28% from 2004 to 2007. Recreationally, it is mostly harvested via hook and line and gigging, with the majority of harvest occurring in the summer and fall (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). It has experienced increasingly heavy exploitation over the last two decades (ca. 1990–2010) largely due to the increased gillnet-harvested fish (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). In a recent tagging study, 93.4% of recovered individuals were captured in the commercial gillnet fishery, and the large majority (87.7%) of these individuals were estimated to be non-reproductive individuals in age-class one (Smith and Scharf 2010). This selective removal of sexually immature individuals (age 0 and age 1) causes demographic shifts and creating the potential for long-term population-level effects.<br/><br/>Despite increasing management efforts, numerous stock assessments conclude that the stock is still being over harvested in North Carolina (NCDMF 2005, Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009, Smith and Scharf 2010). Improvements have occurred in the stock since the terminal year (2002) of the 2005 stock assessment (NCDMF 2005), due largely to one year of high recruitment. However, it is worth noting that the Atlantic population may be particularly vulnerable to consecutive years of low recruitment. The most recent stock assessment (2009) concluded that the stock is 'depleted', which means the spawning stock abundance is below a predetermined threshold. This is due to over-harvesting, which has occurred since 1991 (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009, NCDMF 2012). Estimated spawning stock biomass declined by 50% between 1991-2003, but increased to levels equal to that in 1991 in recent years (2005-2007) (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). Estimated total female abundance declined by 25% over the past 17 years (1991-2007) (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). This was calculated using endpoints of the data. This decline occurred despite reduced fishing pressure, which may be a result of the systematic over-estimation of age<sup>-0</sup> and age<sup>-1</sup> fish and that this assessment is unable to account for all sources of removal of young fishes from the population, notably by the shrimp trawl fishery. Over half of the stock was estimated to be age<sup>-0</sup>, with the only notable shift in age structure being a small increase in older fish (ages 3 through 6+) in the last two years of the assessment (2005-2007).<br/><br/><strong><em>Florida Atlantic</em></strong>: In Florida, commercial catch statistics for <em>P. lethostigma</em> are lumped with those for <em>P. albigutta</em> and <em>P. dentatus</em>. Gulf Flounder (<em>P. albigutta</em>) is the most abundant, large flounder in shallow waters of east-central Florida. Southern Flounder is less abundant in this area and apparently occurs in deeper waters than the Gulf Flounder (Murphy et al. in situ VanderKooy 2000). The majority of Florida's flounder landings occur on the Atlantic coast (304,867 lbs in 2009), with the majority landed by the recreational sector (68% in 2009). Annual standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) estimates for Atlantic recreational fishers in Florida were relatively stable until 1994, increased through 1997, and have declined to 2001 (less than one fish per trip) (FMRI 2003). Commercial catch rates fluctuate around 20 lbs/trip between 1992-2008, but sharply declined between 2004-2008 (FMRI 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico Population</strong><br/>Each individual Gulf state assesses and manages their flounder fisheries independently. As of 2000, a lack of data prevented a complete Gulf-wide stock assessment for the flounder fishery. Southern Flounder represents 95% of the harvested flounders throughout the entire Gulf (VanderKooy 2000, Froeschke <em>et al</em>. 2011). There is evidence that this species has a skewed sex ratio, which may limit reproduction. The continuous decline in abundance in the Gulf of Mexico population has been attributed primarily to commercial and recreational over-harvesting and bycatch mortality from shrimp trawls, not to recruitment limitation. In particular, the decline in adult abundance may be attributed to lower survivorship of adults and late juveniles nearing maturity (sub-adult stage) due to increased fishing and/or natural mortality. Recent trends show a decrease in effectiveness of by-catch reduction devices in the Gulf of Mexico due to modifications made by fishermen in order to minimize the loss of commercially valuable shrimp. Both recreational and commercial fishing rates have ranged from 50,000 fish/year to 500,000 fish/year and by-catch rates have been estimated by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department at 925,000 fish/year to 9.7 million fish/year, demonstrating that by-catch contributes most to fishing mortality (Froeschke <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/><strong><em>Florida</em></strong>: In Florida, commercial catch statistics for <em>P. lethostigma</em> are lumped with those for <em>P. albigutta</em> and <em>P. dentatus</em>. Southern Flounder is landed west of Apalachee Bay, but with less frequency than that of Gulf Flounder (Murphy <em>et al</em>. in situ VanderKooy 2000). Therefore, it is suspected that the Southern Flounder population is naturally low along much of the Florida Gulf coast except the panhandle. Due to the lack of species-specific statistics, the status of the Southern Flounder population is unknown off Florida (Murphy et al. in situ VanderKooy 2000).<br/><br/><em><strong>Alabama</strong></em>: Southern Flounder are commercially and recreationally targeted off Alabama, with most harvested as bycatch in the commercial shrimp fisheries. A stock assessment is currently underway, but early estimates appear to indicate that the population is stable (Gulf FINFO 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mississippi</em></strong>: Southern Flounder are commercially and recreationally targeted off Mississippi, with recreational landings being the larger of the two sectors. The Mississippi Department of Marine Resources has not completed a formal stock assessment, but trends in harvest and population data indicate that the stock is stable and fishing effort level as appropriate (low and mostly taken as bycatch in other fisheries) (Gulf FINFO 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Louisiana</em></strong>: Southern Flounder comprises the majority of the flounder fishery off Louisiana. Most commercial harvests (about 85%) are caught as bycatch in the shrimp fishery. Landings have averaged around 0.6 million pounds/year from 2003 to 2013. Commercial gear restrictions enacted in 1995 led to a substantial (84%) decline in landings. In the most recent years, recreational landings have trended upwards, with the highest occurring in 2013. Catch-per-unit-effort in the recreational fishery and in a fishery-independent trawl survey do not have significant trends over the past three generation lengths (since 1995) (Blanchet 2010). The stock is assessed every five years by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. In the past, Louisiana has declared emergency closures of the commercial Southern Flounder fishery (1996). A statistical catch at age model was used to describe dynamics of <em>P. lethostigma</em> from 1981-2013. The conservation threshold for this species as established by the Louisiana legislature is a 30% spawning potential ratio. Results from the most recent published assessment (2010) were uncertain, mostly due to the lack of information on natural mortality (Blanchet 2010). Based on results of the 2015 assessment, the Louisiana stock is neither overfished nor experiencing overfishing and the current spawning potential ratio is estimated at 50% (LDWF in prep. 2015, referenced in meeting LDWF minutes, Baton Rouge LA, February 5, 2015). The most recent stock assessment (2015) was not available at the time of this assessment, but the stock appears to be recovering due to conservation measures.<br/><br/><em><strong>Texas</strong></em>: The Texas stock occurs on the boundary between the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico populations and is harvested by both the commercial and recreational sectors (Blandon <em>et al</em>. 2001). Commercial by-catch contributes most to the fishing mortality rate of Southern Flounder in Texas (Froeschke <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is considered to be in uncertain to poor condition due to the impact of bycatch from shrimp trawling and overexploitation. Although separate catch statistics are not available, <em>P. lethostigma</em> dominates the overall flounder catch (approximately 95%). Most fish landed are females (due to the 14 inch size restriction) and a skewed sex ratio has emerged; out of ~ 900 individuals that could be sexed, 17% were male, indicating a female: male ratio of 6:1. This may be limiting reproductive potential (GSMFC 2000). Declines in commercial and recreational landings prompted an examination of long-term population trends. Estimated female abundance declined by 44% over 14 years (1984-1997) (Fisher in situ VanderKooy 2000). A fisheries-independent study conducted between 1975-2008 was used to assess population trends of juvenile and adult Southern Flounder. Over this 33 year time series, both juveniles and adults continuously declined; juveniles declined at an estimated rate of 1.3% per year, while adults declined at a higher rate of 2.5% per year (Froeschke <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on these data, and assuming a generation length of 5 years, the population declined by 30% over three generation lengths (15 years). Additionally, a reduced proportion of <em>P. lethostigma</em> are reaching maturity. Inshore commercial harvest declined from 500,000 fish per year between 1985 and 1987 to &lt;100,000 fish in 2007 and offshore commercial harvest declined from 325,000 fish in 1987 to &lt;50,000 in 2007. Recreational catch declined from 200,000 fish in 1987 to &lt;50,000 fish in 2007 (Riechers 2008). The most recent stock assessment (in preparation) indicates that spawning stock biomass has increased and fishing mortality decreased due to regulations implemented after 2009. Managers consider the fishery to be in recovery.<br/><br/><strong>Global</strong><br/>North Carolina reported an average commercial catch one order of magnitude greater than any other state (Atlantic or Gulf) (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). Tagging studies have shown that this species does not typically migrate far distances (Wenner <em>et al</em>. 1990, Monaghan 1992, Scharf <em>et al</em>. 2008). These two centres of abundance (North Carolina and the northern Gulf of Mexico) may be due to the temperature and muddy-bottom habitat preference of this species (VanderKooy 2000).<br/><br/>There is concern regarding the uncertainty of the data upon which stock assessments have been constructed in flounder fisheries. Out of the six U.S. states that monitor the Southern Flounder population in their waters, the most accurate population estimates have been conducted by Texas (Froeschke <em>et al</em>. 2011) and North Carolina (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009), which show 30% and 25% declines respectively over the past three generations (15 years). Three of the states (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana) report stable populations, while the status off Florida is unknown (VanderKooy 2000, Gulf FINFO 2015). On average over the past 23 years, Louisiana reported the highest average landings in both the recreational and commercial sectors for the Gulf of Mexico (NOAA Fisheries Annual Commercial Landings Statistics). However, it is not known if one or more states contain a greater proportion of the Gulf population because the last Gulf-wide assessment was inconclusive (VanderKooy 2000). Population connectivity Studies using microsatellite DNA markers concluded that the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic populations of Southern Flounder are strongly genetically distinct and should be managed separately (Anderson and Karel 2012). Additionally, based on allozymes, there is evidence for some isolation by distance between eastern and western populations in the Gulf of Mexico (Blandon <em>et al</em>. 2001), and it has been suggested that for the purposes of stock enhancement, any strategy in the Gulf should necessarily include eastern and western stocking areas (Blandon <em>et al</em>. 2001). Despite otolith morphometric variation evidence pointing towards extensive mixing within basins (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic), this species is managed at the state level (Midway <em>et al</em>. 2014). The simultaneous declines across the entire range of the species suggests that broad-scale oceanographic mechanisms (e.g., climate or oceanographic change, habitat loss) may be contributing to population declines (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Decreasing,"<em>Paralichthys lethostigma</em> is distributed in the western north Atlantic Ocean, from the Chesapeake Bay south along the U.S. to the Loxahatchee River, Florida; absent along the southern Florida peninsula; and in the Gulf of Mexico, from the west coast of Florida at the Caloosahatchee River estuary, and west from Tampa Bay along the entire U.S. Gulf coast, and south to Tuxpan, Mexico (Gilbert 1986, Munroe 2002, R. Robertson pers. comm. 2014).","This&#160;species supports&#160;valuable commercial and recreational fisheries in U.S. waters; mainly the northern Gulf of Mexico (Warren <em>et al</em>. 1994, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 1995) and the southeast Atlantic (Monaghan 1996). It&#160;is the single most valuable finfish exploited by North Carolina fisheries (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). Juveniles and adults are also susceptible to capture by shrimp trawl fisheries.",Marine,"Management of the U.S. Southern Flounder fishery is the responsibility of the respective states.&#160;A Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for the Gulf of Mexico flounder fishery was developed by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2000, which set harvest limits on both recreational and commercial fishing.&#160;Florida has implemented limits on recreational daily bags and minimum size.&#160;In North Carolina, this species is managed and stock assessments are performed. A number of regulations have been implemented, including seasonal closures, gear specifications for net fisheries, minimum size, and the use of by-catch reduction devices in shrimp and crab trawl fisheries (Mumford 1999, NCDMF 2010). Additionally, gill netting restrictions and closures were implemented in 2010 to reduce sea turtle by-catch, which may benefit this species.&#160;Recreational regulations as of 2010 include: 15 inches total length minimum size limit and a six fish creel limit for all joint and coastal waters (NCDMF 2010).&#160;The state of North Carolina has set a goal of rebuilding the spawning stock of Southern Flounder by 2015. The forthcoming amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for this species include size limit increases, season closures, and creel limit decreases &#160;(NCDMF 2010).&#160;Future research for the North Carolina population is recommended to focus on the impact of its occurrence as shrimp trawl bycatch, in recreational gigging, crab pots and pound nets, which were not included in the 2009 stock assessment (Takade-Heumacher and Batsavage 2009). In addition, the sustainability of the stock is dependent on gaining a better understanding of maturity schedules as well as allowing smaller individuals time to mature and spawn (Midway and Scharf 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Texas also enforces a bag limit (Riechers 2008). To reduce bycatch mortality from shrimp trawls, a limited entry coupled with buy-back program of shrimp vessels was established in 2002 in Texas. This resulted in retirement of 57% of estuary/bait licenses, subsequently reducing flounder catches by at least 40% (Riechers 2008). Until 2008, the Southern Flounder management program in Texas was not sufficient to maintain a sustainable population. Recommendations to increase survivorship of one- and two-year-old fish, so that more post-juveniles reach sexual maturity, have been suggested (Stunz <em>et al</em>. 2000, Froeschke<em> et al.</em> 2011).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The large body size and inferred low intrinsic rate of population increase suggests that this skate will be highly sensitive to exploitation. Two genetically distinct subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeast Atlantic. In the Northeast Atlantic, the depth range of this species extends down the continental slope to 900 m, but it is rarely encountered on the outer continental shelves. There are limited data on occurrence in Norwegian waters, the Faroes Grounds and the French and Iberian Atlantic shelves but nothing is known of current population trends in the Northeast Atlantic region.

Size at birth is 17 cm total length (TL; Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Estimated length at 50% maturity was 83.2 cm TL for males and 104.4 cm TL for females (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2011). Both sexes are estimated to reach sexual maturity between six and eight years. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Stehmann and Bürkel (1984) reported a maximum size of 150 cm TL.

The large body size (150 cm), and presumably slow growth and later maturation and likely low intrinsic rate of population increase of this species render it especially vulnerable to exploitation such as trawling and at risk of local extinction (Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002).<strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>There are no specific data available on threats, however it is inferred that, similar to other large-bodied skates, this species may be retained as bycatch in demersal trawl and longline fisheries, particularly in deeper waters. Although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets. This species is caught and landed from offshore fisheries as reported by the United Kingdom, but data are unreliable. These landings are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012). Given recent restrictions on landing other members of this genus, recent data indicating increasing catches of this skate are questionable due to possible reporting of other species as Longnosed Skate (<em>Dipturus oxyrinchus</em>; ICES 2013). </p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This skate<em> </em>is captured as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries targeting Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>) or Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and by offshore bottom longlines. Over the last 50 years, trawl effort has increased numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was historically exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries composed of 27 small, low-powered boats with a total of 2,700 horse power (hp), between 1974 and 1987 effort has increased to a total of 19,940 hp. In particular, fishing effort targeting small pelagic fish has increased (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), the main intergovernmental decision-making body on fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea, has made the decision to refrain from expanding deepwater fishing operations beyond the limit of 1,000 m. However this species occurs mostly from 200-500 m, thus deepwater fisheries development within the depth range of this species remains a cause for concern.</p>","<p>Two genetically distinct subpopulations exist in the Mediterranean Sea and the Northeast Atlantic.</p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>Little is known of the subpopulation status or trends in abundance in the Northeast Atlantic, but it is suspected to have declined or contracted in range. Between the late 1960s and 2002 United Kingdom groundfish surveys occasionally reported this species in the northern North Sea and Celtic Sea at depths of 111−159 m. Catch rates over this time period were very low ranging between 0.01 and 0.11 individuals captured per hour of trawling (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Surveys of the northern Norwegian Coast, 54 individuals were reported in 1994, and only two individuals were reported in 2005 (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). Along the northern coast of Norway from 1992−2005, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2008) caught a mean of 7.7 individuals per square kilometre. The catches in this study were relatively high, indicating that although the species is somewhat rare, local aggregations may occur. In and around the Bay of Biscay catches showed large fluctuations, ranging from zero tonnes in 1999, to 16 tonnes in 2002, and decreasing again to zero tonnes in 2010 (ICES 2012). Although information is limited, the sensitive life history characteristics and available data suggest that this subpopulation is declining in Northeast Atlantic waters. </p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>In the Mediterranean, the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) preformed 6,336 tows between 1994 and 1999 over the entire European Mediterranean area and Morocco at a depth of 10−800 m. This species was the second most abundant skate in this survey and was recorded in 3% of hauls in this area. It was found at depths ranging from 50 to 800 m, but was caught most frequently between 200 and 500 m in the western central Mediterranean Sea and eastwards in the Aegean Sea (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001, Serena 2005, Serena <em>et al</em>. 2010). A longline survey in 2004 confirmed the presence of this species in the southeast Aegean Sea, around Rhodes between 300 and 400 m depth (Corsini-Foka 2009). <span lang=""EN-GB"">This species was historically present in the Gulf of Lions, northwest Mediterranean Sea, where it was captured in 10% (n=27) of hauls, occurring between 1959 and 1972 (coast to 150 m depth) and was also present in the catches of surveys performed between 1980−1984. It was subsequently absent from 628 scientific tows done in the same area in the period 1985−1995 (Aldebert 1997). Similarly, in the Adriatic Sea, historical trawl surveys from 1948 showed that this species was present in 3.2% of hauls carried out on the continental shelf, while in a comparable MEDITS survey in 1998 reported that this species was absent from all hauls on the continental shelf (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). In the south Ligurian and north Tyrrhenian Seas this species has been found at depths ranging from 164−750 m, and was mostly concentrated on the outer margin of the slope from 300−400 m. Over this survey period, biomass has reportedly decreased while abundance remained stable. This suggests a change in population structure, with an increasing presence of juveniles in catches. Given the sensitive life history characteristics, evidence of significant population declines and apparent disappearance in some localised areas (likely due to fisheries pressure), this subpopulation is considered to be decreasing throughout the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Considering the status of other<em>&#160;Dipturus&#160;</em>species in the European region,&#160;<em>D. oxyrinchus</em>&#160;is also inferred to be in decline, although to a lesser extent due to its smaller size, and it is suspected that the species has declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three-generation span).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>In the Northeast Atlantic<strong> </strong>this skate occurs on the outer continental shelf and continental slope from central Norway southwards (Heintz 1962, Stehmann and Bürkel 1984).

It is suspected that these trends are likely to be representative throughout its range. Starry Skate&#160;is inferred to have undergone a decline of 20% throughout its distribution, and it is therefore assessed as Near Threatened as it is close to qualify as threatened under Criterion A2. Further information on its status in the southern Mediterranean Sea is needed.</p>","<p>Starry Skates are found predominantly on the Italian and Corsica continental shelves between shallow waters and 150 m depth (Baino and Serena 2000). In the eastern Ionian Sea, the species is found down to depths of 343 m (Mytilineou <em>et al.</em> 2005), although this is probably due to misidentifications. The species prefers muddy and sandy bottoms (Vannucci 2005). </p>  <p>Maximum size is estimated at 72 cm total length (TL) for males and of 76 cm TL for females (Bono <em>et al.</em> 2005, Serena and Abella 1999). Barone <em>et al.</em> (2006) and Serena <em>et al.</em> (2005) estimate length at maturity at 51.7 cm TL for males and 56.1 cm TL for females, and Serena and Abella (1999) and Bauchot (1987) reported length at maturity at 45 to 54 cm TL for males and 60 cm TL for females. Age at maturity is reported at three to four years for both males and females (Serena and Abella 1999, Bono <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species is egg laying, with 34 to 112 egg cases laid depending on individual size, and egg cases can reach 45 mm in length and 30 mm width (Bauchot 1987). Juveniles are about 8 cm TL when they emerge from the egg cases in January. The sex ratio is about 1:1 (Minervini <em>et al.</em> 1985, Abella <em>et al.</em> 1997). Juveniles move quickly into shallow waters from 5-7 m depth soon after birth and then move into deeper waters progressively as they grow (Abella and Serena 2002, Catalano <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>  <p>Recent preliminary tagging experiments (Catalano <em>et al.</em> 2003) suggest a faster growth rate than described in previous literature (Serena and Abella 1999). As this species reaches maturity relatively early (~3 years) and has a short lifespan (~10 years) it is considered to be relatively productive, even though it is only moderately fecund. </p>  <p>In the Central Tyrrhenian Sea, length at 50% maturity values estimated by Romanelli <em>et al.</em> (2007) were 56.5cm TL and 50.5cm TL for females and males, respectively. In the south Ligurian Sea, males mature by 45 cm TL and females may mature by 53 cm TL (Barone <em>et al.</em> 2007). Total length at 50% maturity was estimated to be 51.7 cm and 56.1 cm TL for males and females respectively. In the Catalan Sea, the size at first maturity for females was assessed to be around 48.1 cm TL, while males showed a maturing phase from 45 to 51 cm TL (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2013). These estimates are lower than the ones reported in the Gulf of Tunisia (Capapé 1977). The annual rate of population increase is 0.247 year<sup>-1</sup>, and estimated generation time is 4.36 years; the time taken to double the population is 2.81 years (Abella <em>et al.</em> 2011). The estimated generation length is around 6 years.</p>","<p>The species is mainly caught by beam trawls, bottom trawls, trammel, and gill nets. Near the Corsican coast in particular, fishing pressure is low because only a few Corsican trawlers, as well as a few Italian vessels, operate in this area (Abella and Serena 2002). A reduced number of trawlers belonging to the La Spezia fleet operate on the same grounds northwards to Viareggio harbour (the most important fishing port of the north Tyrrhenian- south Ligurian Sea). The Livorno fleet operating in the same area is also relatively small. Trawlers concentrate their effort mainly on the grounds at depths between 100 and 400 m and therefore there is a little overlap with areas in which the Viareggio fleet operate. </p>  <p>Off Tuscany (Ligurian Sea), it is mainly landed as bycatch of beam trawlers, targeting common sole and turbots, however very few of these operate in this area (Abella and Serena 2002). Most small individuals caught near shore with trammel and gill nets by these artisanal fisheries are landed. However the ban on trawling within three miles of the coast in this area of the Mediterranean Sea affords protection for this species' shallow nursery areas. Moreover, a general reduction in fishing effort on the grounds traditionally exploited by the Viareggio fleet occurred during the last 15 years because the number of vessels in operation reduced from 107 in 1985, to 78 in 2000 (Abella and Serena 2002). </p>  <p>Little information is available on the probability of survival of discarded juveniles. Preliminary experiments performed with individuals caught and successively put into marine water pools have demonstrated high rates of survival for released individuals caught with bottom trawl nets (Catalano <em>et al.</em> 2003). </p>  <p>Although this skate is one of the more exploited species in the Ligurian Sea, it is apparently relatively resilient to fishing pressure as a result of its life history characteristics. It is relatively productive due to its early age of first maturity (about three years) and relatively short lifespan (about 10 years), even if it is only moderately fecund (Abella and Serena 2002).</p>  <p>Data available for Starry Skate in the North Sea and eastern English Channel are thought to be unreliable owing to confusion between this species and Blonde Skate (<em>R. brachyura</em>) (ICES 2012). </p>  <p>Fishing mortality calculated from the model in 1978 was assessed to be 74% of total mortality, much higher than the mortality of this group due to predation (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>In the northwest Mediterranean Sea, bottom-trawling operations capture large amounts of juvenile fish due to their low selectivity (Sardà <em>et al.</em> 2004) and Starry Skate is sensitive to the type of non-selective commercial trawling operating throughout the Mediterranean Sea from hatchling to adult sizes (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2013). Results from Coll <em>et al.</em> (2013) confirmed that the species has been and still is highly affected by fishing in the Catalan Sea, particularly trawling, and is very sensitive to increasing fishing effects. Under the current situation and under situations of increasing fishing effort in the future, this skate may disappear from the Catalan Sea, as it has already happened with other rays and skates in highly exploited areas of the North Atlantic (Brander 1981; Casey and Myers 1998, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000). Fishing effects in the Mediterranean Sea are high, and it is likely populations are at low levels. </p>  <p>Continental shelves and coastal areas of the whole Mediterranean Sea are currently subjected to a high fishing pressure from a highly diversified fishing fleet (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2010), therefore posing high threat to populations of Mediterranean endemic rays and skates (Aldebert 1997, Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2010).<em> </em>Starry Skate primarily occupies these areas, and frequently occurs at smaller depths than the depth benchmark of 63 metres for White Skate (<em>Rostroraja alba</em>), which is now locally extinct in parts of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea owing to overfishing (Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Additionally, Starry Skate has a smaller latitudinal range than White Skate and a restricted geographic range, thus making it perceivably more sensitive to fishing (Notarbartolo Di Sciara 1998; Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Finally, strong declines have been documented in regions where immediate deeper refuges are not available, such as in the Gulf of Lions and the Adriatic Sea (Aldebert 1997, Jukić-Peladić <em>et al.</em> 2001). </p>  <p>A recent regional analysis of human effects in the Mediterranean Sea illustrated that fishing intensity is currently high in most coastal and continental shelf systems where this skate is distributed (Coll <em>et al.</em> 2010), therefore fishing effects may be higher than previously evaluated. However, Coll <em>et al.</em> (2013) showed that Starry Skate may respond well under decreasing trawl fishing effort and could substantially recover in the Mediterranean Sea if this were to occur.</p>","<p>  Genetic analysis suggests at least two distinct clusters: Western and Eastern Mediterranean basin, and Sicilian coast and Algeria, and possibly other countries in North Africa (Gerotto 2013).  This species was captured in both the GRUND (Italian waters) and MEDITS (northern Mediterranean basin) trawl surveys (Relini 1998, Bertrand <em>et al.</em> 2000), which began in 1985 and 1994 respectively. In the south Ligurian and north Tyrrhenian Sea it was captured over muddy bottoms, in restricted coastal areas from nine to 190 m depth, but mainly concentrated at 100 to 150 m depth. From 1999 to 2004 the difference between the Biomass Index and Density Index decreased, which may indicate a change in the population structure with a predominance of smaller specimens (Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has a higher relative abundance on the Italian and Corsican continental shelves (Baino and Serena 2000, Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nursery areas are located very close to the coast at two to 15 m depth (Abella and Serena 2005).</p>  <p>Landings of Starry Skate in the southwest North Sea and eastern English Channel, as reported by France, are likely the result of misidentification or incorrect use of species codes (ICES 2012).</p>  <p>Catches in the Aegean Sea MEDITS bottom trawl surveys, from 1998 to 2008, ranged from 24 specimens (9.85kg) in 1998, to nine (2.01kg) in 2003, to 34 (13.91kg) in 2008. Inter-annual variability was high, but there was no overall trend for the time series (Tserpes <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>There have been estimated declines in the MEDITS program in the Adriatic Sea (Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2013), and landings declined over 25 years (1969-1994) in the Gulf of Lions despite no apparent decrease in fishing effort, and in this region the species disappeared entirely from catches in waters &gt;150 m between 1957 and 1995. In waters &lt;150 m deep, it declined by approximately 20%. The same negative trend is reported for the Spanish Mediterranean area. It is suspected that these trends are likely to be representative throughout the species’ range, and thus the species is inferred to have undergone a decline of 20% throughout its distribution during the three-generation period (19 years).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Starry Skate (<em>Raja asterias</em>) can probably be considered endemic in the Mediterranean Sea, but may also occur in the Atlantic, near the southern coast of Portugal (Serena 2005). It has been reported for the northern and southern areas of the Balearic Islands of the western Mediterranean Sea (Massutì and Moranta 2003), in the Tyrrhenian Sea of the northern Mediterranean (Romanelli <em>et al.</em> 2007), as well as along the Tunisian coasts (Capapé 1977), and in the central Tyrrhenian Sea (Minervini <em>et al.</em> 1985).</p>",There is no information available on the use and trade of this species.,Marine,"<p>The development and implementation of management plans (national and/or regional e.g., under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks: IPOA-Sharks) are required to facilitate the conservation and sustainable management of all chondrichthyan species in the region. </p>  <p>The Portuguese Administration adopted a national legislation in October 2011 (Portaria no 315/2011) that prohibits, along the whole continental Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone, during the whole month of May, the catch, the maintenance on board and the landing of any skate species belonging to the genera <em>Raja </em>or <em>Leucoraja </em>(ICES 2012).

It is taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries, but little information is available on landings. This is one of the largest European skates (up to 230 cm total length), and as such, it has low productivity and high catchability, similar to other large skates that have been heavily affected by even moderate levels of bycatch. Skates with a similar range are known to sustain some level of bycatch. Given the status of other <em>Dipturus</em> species in European waters, the low catch levels in surveys and fisheries, and the slow life history of the species, it is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three-generation period). Therefore, the Norwegian Skate is assessed as Near Threatened in the European region as it is close to meet the threshold for threatened under Criterion A2. Further research is required to understand the taxonomy and population status of this species.

This is one of the largest European skates with a maximum total length of at least 230 cm (Ebert and Stehman 2013). Like other skates, it is an egg-laying species.

It is usually discarded when caught incidentally, therefore landings data are limited and of variable quality (ICES 2012). It accounted for 1% of skates recorded in biological sampling in Irish ports between 2001 and 2007 (ICES 2007). This is a large skate with low productivity and high catchability, similar to other large skates that have been significantly affected by even moderate levels of bycatch (Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Deepwater fisheries, including crustacean trawl fisheries, are known to operate within its range.

The status of the population west and southwest of England and Ireland is also uncertain (ICES 2012). There are however suspected declines in areas of the shelf margin that are heavily fished. Despite a lack of species-specific population information, it is possible to infer from the statuses of similar large-bodied skate species and suspicion of trends that the population is likely decreasing, especially because it is larger than its congeners and likely to have a low intrinsic rate of population increase. Considering this and the low catch levels in surveys and fisheries, Norwegian Skate is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past 30 years (three generation period).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Northeast Atlantic in the fjords of central and southern Norway, along the slopes off southern Iceland, western Scotland (including Rockall Trough) and west of Ireland as well as along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Iceland-Faroe Ridge.

It is taken in mixed-species fisheries throughout its range, and is directly targeted in parts of its range for its swim bladder, which can fetch a very high price in international markets. It can live to 15 years of age and forms large spawning aggregations, which are targeted by commercial and artisanal fishers. Overfishing has been documented in the South China Sea, Arabian Sea, Northern Territory waters (Australia), and local declines reported from West Papua. The documented declines (average = ~94% decline) only occur in about a quarter of its range, therefore, total decline is estimated to be about 24% but likely to be higher given suspected declines elsewhere. Given that this species is highly valued (especially for its swim bladder) in international markets, intense fishing pressure has not ceased and is expected to continue, that it is rarely monitored at the species level, and, hence, that declines are likely to continue, this species is listed as Near Threatened under criteria A2b. Research on the impacts of fisheries and management of this species is needed and its catches and trade (domestic and international) should be monitored.","This species is found in coastal waters over mud bottoms to depths of 60 m (Lal Mohan 1984) and is also known to ascend into tidal rivers and estuaries on occasion (Sasaki 2001). This is&#160;a long-lived, predatory species (Phelan <em>et al. </em>2008) and feeds mainly on crustaceans and small fishes. The maximum recorded total length is 150 cm (Sasaki 2001).&#160;The reproduction season is from May to October (Shen<em> et al.</em> 2007) with spawning grounds in western Taiwan (Waisanding Sand Bar) associated with adjacent waters to rivers in the southwestern coast (H.K. Mok pers. comm. 2016). There are limited data regarding longevity and reproductive period for this species in Thailand but biologists from India report that it matures at 85 cm SL at around 3-4 years of age (J. Sommai pers. comm. 2009). Size at first maturity is 92 cm TL (McPherson 1997) and age at first maturity around 4 years (Bray 2019). This species may undertake seasonal migrations dependent on food availability (Thomas and Kunja 1981) or may be related to reproduction (Dhawan 1971); however, inshore aggregations observed in Phelan <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008), were comprised of mostly of individuals below the mature size-classes. This could be an indication that aggregations are not specific to spawning or that larger breeding individuals have been fished down (Phelan <em>et al.</em> 2008). This species can live to at least 15 years of age (Phelan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is about 9.5 years. This was calculated using the following equation: Age at first maturity + (max age - age at first maturity ) / 2","This species is threatened by overexploitation in parts of its range. This species forms spawning aggregations which are targeted by subsistence, recreational and commercial fisheries. In the northern Arabian Sea and&#160;Bay of Bengal, it was previously taken incidentally in mixed-species fisheries, but direct targeting of this species occurred in response to the high price of the swimbladder (Dutta <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is a high juvenile exploitation for the species in northern Arabian Sea and the mean size in the fishery was 373 mm (CMFRI 2015). There are now widespread concerns that the resource is being overexploited (Phelan <em>et al. </em>2008)&#160;but data are limited. There is anecdotal evidence that the annual aggregations of this species along the east coast of Queensland have been reduced as a result of intense fishing activities (Bowtell 1995, 1998). This species is tarted by local fisherman in West Papua where localized declines have been reported as a result of overfishing (USAID 2019).","This species is overfished in Northern Territory waters (Australia). Recent biomass and egg production were estimated at 28% of unfished levels (Northern Territory Government 2016), down from the 62% biomass and 38% egg production of unfished levels reported in the 2011 stock assessment (Northern Territory Government 2015, Grubert <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). This yields an estimated 98% decline in biomass over three generations (28.5 years). The minimum size at first maturity for females in Phelan <em>et al.</em> (2008) (79 cm TL)&#160;was much smaller than the 92 cm TL reported previously in Queensland waters. Mature individuals<em>&#160;</em>comprised only a small component of fished species in a 1999-2000 sampling program (Phelan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). In the Northern Peninsula Area (Australia), 96% of the catch in 1999 taken between April and August and 89% of the catch in 2000 taken between May and September was comprised of this species. Catch numbers in 1999 and 2000 exceeded 50 individuals&#160;per boat with CPUE peaking at 224.5 kg boat per hour (Phelan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). Total annual catch of this species in Northern Territory waters peaked at about 600 t in 2004/2005 and decreased to just over 200 t by 2010 (estimated 99% decline over three generations). While spatially averaged CPUE for the same time period has fluctuated, the long term trend is decline (Grubert <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Based on its capture volumes, the species was probably abundant in India and Australia. In northwest coast off Saurasshtra, India, the total catch of&#160;this species<em>&#160;</em>in February, 2003 was about 315.2 kg, contributing 8.6% of all marine fish harvested in the month (Vijayan <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003).  In Palk Bay, India, the annual catch of&#160;this species&#160;by trawlers contributed to about 20% of all croaker catches from 1988 to 1992 (Jayasankar 1997).&#160;In the trawl fishery of Gujarat this species<em>&#160;</em>formed 3 % of sciaenid composition during 2016 (CMFRI 2017).&#160;Off Vanakbara, India, annual catch of this species increased in the early 2000s to 1,342.8 t in 2005 and subsequently decreased to 788 t in 2007 (estimated 95% decline over three generations). CPUE was highest in 2005 at 3.1 kg/h<sup>-1&#160;</sup>(Ghosh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). This species contributed 5% (8,600 t) to the sciaenids during 1999 - 2007 in India (M. Gurusaranam pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/>Cheung and Pitcher (2008) showed the CPUE of this species had declined over 90% from mid-1970s to late 80s in the northern South China Sea, which is probably due to over fishing. According to Thailand Fisheries Statistics, the catching rate might be stable; however, this species is not a large catch and more data on biology are needed (J. Sommai pers. comm. 2016). Anecdotal evidence also suggests declines in Saudi Arabia (Abdulrahman Ben-Hasan pers. comm. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The documented declines (average = ~94% decline) only occur in about a quarter of its range, although declines are strongly suspected elsewhere, therefore, total decline over the past three generations is estimated to be about 24%.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs from the Persian Gulf to southern China and western Taiwan, south through the Philippines and Borneo to New Guinea and northern Australia (Sasaki 2001).

This species is also targeted in Bintuni Bay, West Papua by local fisherman and can fetch high market price (USAID 2019). The species forms annual  spawning aggregations in inshore northern Australian waters where it is targeted by subsistence and recreational  fishers (Phelan 2008). Indigenous fishers of the Cape York  Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) reported that large adult individuals made up the majority of the catch from the  aggregations until about 1994.

Surveys at aggregation sites in 2002  and 2003 established that much larger fish (mean size 103.5 cm TL) were  again present on the aggregation grounds, albeit in very low numbers.  These preliminary results highlight the critical need for continued  monitoring and management of this fishery in the NPA.

An international system is needed to improve management of the species, and more information is needed on trends in fishing effort. Over ten years from 2005 – 2015, FAO landings statistics for this species, comprising catches from Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China, show a 27% decline in catch for this species. The majority of the data is considered to represent Chinese catches and Chinese fishing effort is deemed to have remained constant or increasing. A 27% decline is close to meeting the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A2bd and as such this species is listed as Near Threatened.

In the southern East China Sea, sea surface temperature has been increasing significantly since the 1980's, particularly in winter due to climate change (Liu and Zhang 2013).

Survival from the larval to juvenile stages varies inter-annually depending on environmental conditions in the Kuroshio Current system, which can impact recruitment success (Sassa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). According to annual FAO landings statistics for 'Japanese jack mackerel' reported by Taiwan, Korea, Japan and China, catch peaked between 1960-1965 and steeply declined afterwards. Catch has been on a generally increasing trend since 1980, but has not reached historical peak catches (FAO FishStatJ database accessed June 2017). Over the past three generation lengths, which is estimated as nine years and a time period from 2006-2015, total catch reported to FAO declined by 27%, from 324,975 tons in 2006 to 236,716 in 2015. This catch decline appears to be largely driven by Chinese catch. Although trends in Chinese effort are not known, it is suspected that effort is stable or increasing.&#160;During the early to mid 1960's, Japanese catches were at 450,000 to 550,000 metric tons, but declined sharply starting in 1967 to 50,000 thousand metric tons in 1980 due to to over-exploitation (Song <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, the fishery has gradually recovered since the late 1980's, with catch during 1990–2001 reaching 210,000 to 330,000 metric tons in southern Japan (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). From 1980–2013, catches in Japanese fisheries fluctuated widely between 50,000 to 319,000 metric tons (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and in general experience decadal shifts in catch (Sassa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Korean catch also declined in the 1960's to below 10,000 metric tons and then increased in the early 1980's to 23,000 metric tons (Zhang and Lee 2001).&#160;<br/> This species occurred in 77% of the hauls and comprised 5% of the catch in a trawl survey conducted from 2006 to 2013&#160;in the Common Fishing Zone between Vietnam and China in the Gulf of Tonkin (Nguyen 2015). This species is abundant, and typically accounts for approximately 80% of the entire fish community from February to December off Geumo Island, South Korea (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2016). In 2012, the total allowable catch limit for Korea was 21,000 metric tons (Zhang&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Catch and effort has increased in Taiwanese waters over the past decade, and in 2010-2011, the catch contained a high proportion of immature fish (Lu<em> et al. </em>2013).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the northwestern Pacific the East China Sea from Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan to the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam (Sassa <em>et al. </em>2016).

Management is needed to reduce the capture of immature and spawning individuals in the Taiwanese fishery (Lu<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013).

It occurs on the continental slope at depths of 200–2,080 m, and mostly at depths &gt;500 m.&#160;The species is&#160;caught as both targeted and incidental catch in&#160;midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries&#160;operating across most of its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There have been a number of management measures implemented in recent years, both species-specific and more generally for deep-water sharks. Still, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. Population declines have been reported in part of its range but increasing trends in others. The&#160;Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish&#160;is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (111 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","<p>The Longnose Velvet Dogfish is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 200–2,080 m, and mostly at depths &gt;500 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–9 pups and size-at-birth is 28–35 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). Female age at maturity is 20 years and maximum age is 54 (Irvine<em> et al.</em> 2006), resulting in a generation length of 37 years.</p>","<p>The Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. The species is likely to have refuge at depth; the species has been found to be most abundant at depths &gt;900 m (e.g. Gordon 1999, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1998) and its peak distribution in the Northeast Atlantic was between 750–1,050&#160;m (Neat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of this species have likely been recorded in mixed categories, including ""siki sharks"" (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured occasionally in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but could be high; at vessel mortality for the congener, Owston's Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus owstoni</em>), was found to be 80% (Ellis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the East Central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region. Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). <br/><br/>The species is occasionally reported as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries operating off Chile&#160;targeting Chilean Hake (<em>Merluccinus gayi gayi</em>) (SUBPESCA 2017), as well as demersal&#160;crustacean fisheries (Acuña<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005) and demersal&#160;longline Patagonian Toothfish fisheries (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>) (Lamilla 2008).&#160;It is also occasionally reported from deep-water longline and shrimp trawl fisheries off southwest India&#160;(Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Longnose Velvet Dogfish to have extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and longline, and gillnets and high vulnerability to midwater trawl in Southern Indian Ocean, and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). <br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, the Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish is regularly reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Francis <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson<em> et al. </em>2018). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from industrial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford<em>&#160;et al. </em>2018), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).</p>","<p>Population genetics have indicated separate populations in the Pacific and Atlantic (Keggin 2017). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic (F. Neat unpubl. data), and (2) relative abundance in the Southwest Pacific (Francis&#160;<a><em>et</em></a><em>&#160;al</em><em>. </em>2016, Stevens&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018). The trend data from each source&#160;were analyzed over three generation lengths (111 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, nominal CPUE from Scottish trawl surveys have fluctuated since 1998 (F. Neat, unpubl. data, ICES-WGEF 2018). The trend analysis of that data from 2009 to 2019 revealed an annual rate of increase of 3.8% consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;161.2% over three generation lengths (111 years), with the highest probability of&#160;no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. Industrial landings of all deep-water dogfishes in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~11,000 t in 2003, before rapidly declining to 220 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES 2015).<br/><br/>Second, the trend analysis of combined relative biomass estimates from fisheries independent research trawl surveys from New Zealand revealed an annual rate of increase of 0.43%, consistent with an estimated increase of 46.2% over the three generation lengths (111 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. <br/><br/>In Australia,&#160;significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of dogfishes (mainly <em>Centrophorus</em> spp and&#160;<em>Squalus </em>spp) from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).&#160;Catches of Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;were regularly reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean annual catch estimate of 56 t between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007). In New Zealand,&#160;the Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;is considered to have a relatively large sized population (Ford&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Longnose Velvet Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish population is estimated to have increased in the Northeast Atlantic&#160;and Southwest Pacific and is suspected to have declined off West Africa. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest Pacific were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 10.7%, with the highest probability of no major reduction over three generation lengths (111 years). Trends were estimated to be reflective of ~50% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 20–29% is estimated over the last three generation lengths, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Longnose Velvet Dogfish has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the east Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;</p>",The species has been utilised for its flesh and liver oil.&#160;The liver has low oil content and the species is likely discarded in India&#160;(Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011).,Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Longnose Velvet Dogfish, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa and western South America.

The species is considered a ""key species of concern"" within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>In Australia, deep-water sharks, including the Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish, are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, divided into eastern and western zone fisheries&#160;(Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).

In particular, it is one of the most common species found in fish markets across Thailand, where overall catch landings of sharks have declined by &gt;90% from 10,000 tons to 1,000 tons in less than a decade (2004–2011). It is susceptible to capture in a range of fishing gear, and given its coastal preference, the distribution for this species largely overlaps with artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries. Within Australia, the species is afforded protection through marine park zones throughout several parts of its distribution; it is not targeted for any fishery and as bycatch it is largely released with likely high survival rates given its general hardiness. There may be some level of take for the aquarium trade. <br/><br/>There is some taxonomic uncertainty for this species with evidence suggesting that the Australian form may be a cryptic sister-species to the Southeast Asian form. This taxonomic uncertainty has implications for the conservation of this species as this may limit the replenishment of exploited populations if they do not receive recruitment from largely unexploited populations. Based on the ongoing threats to this species from fishing pressure, habitat destruction and suspected population declines based on declines in aggregate Thai shark landings, the Grey Carpetshark is assessed globally as Near Threatened. In Southeast Asia where the fishing pressure is greatest and increasing, it may meet Vulnerable in the near future as it is likely to be close to meeting the thresholds for criterion A2bd. A key priority is to clarify population reduction and population substructure.<br/><br/>In Australia, where mortality from fisheries is limited, and the species is common in some marine protected areas, the species is assessed as Least Concern.","The&#160;Grey Carpetshark&#160;is found in a variety of habitats including nearshore intertidal and subtidal habitats, over sandy and muddy substrates, seagrass beds and rocky and coral reef habitat to depths of 85 m (White and Potter 2004, Last and Stevens 2009, Chin <em>et al. </em>2012). The species is extremely hardy and physiologically adapted to inhabiting environments that undergo cyclical hypoxic conditions (e.g., coral reef flats; Chapman and Renshaw 2011). Small individuals hide in crevices and among coral and are well camouflaged with their broad banding pattern.<br/><br/>The&#160;Grey Carpetshark&#160;is an oviparous species. Sperm storage occurs with one captive female shark storing sperm for 45 months before producing offspring (Bernal <em>et al.</em> 2015). Captive aquaria females lay large numbers of eggs with 466 eggs laid during one year for 3 females (Phuket, Thailand; Yano <em>et al.</em> 2005) and 692 eggs laid in one year between six females (Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia; Harahush <em>et al.</em> 2007). The number of eggs per year varies markedly demonstrating potential variation in fecundity due to external conditions with only 21.4% of eggs producing hatchlings (Harahush <em>et al.</em> 2007). The&#160;Grey Carpetshark&#160;has demonstrated a clear seasonal mating and egg laying period in captivity in Queensland, Australia (Harahush <em>et al.</em> 2007). Incubation periods differed between aquaria with hatching occurring after 92 days (Phuket, Thailand; Yano <em>et al. </em>2005) and 153 days (Mooloolaba, Queensland, Australia; Harahush <em>et al.</em> 2007). The differences may be due to higher ambient water temperatures in the Thai aquaria or may also reflect population level differences (Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Eggs hatch between 13 and 18 cm total length (TL; Last and Stevens 2009).&#160;Compagno (2001) reports size at maturity for males at 68 to 76 cm TL, and females at about 63 cm TL. Similar male sizes at maturity were reported from Malaysia (68-76 cm TL; Yano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) and Indonesia (65–66 cm TL; Dharmadi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Last and Stevens (2009) report male size of maturity at 82 cm TL for Grey Carpetshark from Australia.&#160;This shark attains a maximum adult size of at least 132 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009). Species-specific age and growth information is not available for the&#160;Grey Carpetshark. A congeneric, the Whitespotted Bambooshark (<em>C. plagiosum</em>), demonstrates an age at maturity of 4.5 years and maximum known age in the wild of 12.5 years (but captive age of 25 years; Chen <em>et al.</em> 2007), resulting in a generation length of 8.55 years. Captive&#160;Grey Carpetshark&#160;are known to at least 16 years of age (Harahush <em>et al. </em>2007), and using the age at maturity of&#160;Whitespotted Bambooshark, a generation length of 9.5 years is estimated for the Grey Carpetshark.","The Grey Carpetshark is widely fished across most of its range outside of northern Australia. It comprises one of the most commonly landed shark species at Thai fishing ports where capture is primarily through otter trawls and also pair trawls. Aggregate shark landings have decreased from ~10,000 tons in 2004 to ~1,000 tons in 2011 (Krajandara 2014). Assuming these declining landings are indicative of overfishing-induced declines and are indicative of population reduction of this species they represent a &gt;90% population reduction within a three generation span (~28.5 years). Declines are likely to have also occurred elsewhere. This species was the most common of all the orectolobiform sharks (comprising 77.9%) landed in Indonesia during surveys from April 2001-March 2006. Landings were recorded from Jakarta, Bali and Lombok fish markets from trawl, handline, longline and gillnet fisheries (Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015). Genetic analyses (DNA barcoding) of shark fins collected during market surveys conducted across Indonesia from mid 2012 to mid 2014 found the vast majority of landed species were pelagic sharks with common reef and carpet sharks extremely rare. Given the extensive shallow coastal habitat around Indonesia that would support the reef and carpet shark species, the authors conclude that this is a strong indication of the collapse of reef shark populations in Indonesia, most likely due to overfishing (Semibiring <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive trawling in the Arafura Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2005) and in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009) is likely to impact the Grey Carpetshark in these regions. Documented large declines in shark and ray catches associated with corresponding increases in fishing effort in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009) is likely to have a large impact on the Grey Carpetshark in Indonesian waters and may be representative of fishing impacts across the region.<br/><br/>A prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea and the Grey Carpetshark is caught in the Gulf of Papua in moderate numbers (W. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Within Australia, small numbers of the Grey Carpetshark are captured in the Pilbara Trawl (Western Australian Department of Fisheries 2010), the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fisheries (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011), the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (Kyne 2010), the Northern Prawn Fishery (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002) and most certainly other fisheries in northern Australia. Carpetsharks are generally discarded in Australian fisheries.","Little is known of Grey Carpetshark population structure or trends in the wild. It has been reported in large numbers at fish markets in Thailand (Compagno 2001, Krajangdara 2014), although is less frequently observed by SCUBA divers as reported from Thailand (1% sighting rate based on &gt;4,400 dives; Thailand eShark Project 2015) and Indonesia (Erdmann, pers. comm. 2015). <br/><br/>In Australia, it is commonly encountered at various locations, such as reef flats in the Capricorn-Bunker group, Great Barrier Reef and in Moreton Bay, Queensland. It can been seen in groups of up to a dozen individuals at specific locations that provide protection/cover in otherwise open environments.",Decreasing,"The Grey Carpetshark is widely distributed within the Indo-West Pacific in tropical and warm-temperate waters occurring in a variety of habitats throughout its range. It is known from India, Southeast Asia, Japan, southern New Guinea and northern Australia (Last and Stevens 2009, Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). It is uncertain whether the&#160;Grey Carpetshark&#160;occurs in the Western  Indian Ocean where it has been reported as bycatch from fish markets  from the Persian Gulf (Paighambari and Daliri 2012).&#160;There is taxonomic uncertainty for this species with evidence suggesting that the Australian form may be a cryptic sister-species to the Southeast Asian form (Naylor <em>et al.</em> 2012).",<p>This species is a commonly caught inshore species for meat and other products and is also displayed and bred in aquaria (Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>,Marine,"The species is protected in a significant proportion of its Australian range on the east coast of Australia in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Moreton Bay Marine Park. While fishing is still allowed in most areas of the parks, the species is not targeted and is likely to survive capture as bycatch due to its general hardiness.<br/><br/>Re-stocking of wild populations from captive bred aquaria stock (Phuket Marine Biological Centre) has occurred on one occasion in Phuket, Thailand which comprised the release of 99 captive bred sharks between 6-12 months old on 02 December 2004, marking the birthday of HM King Bhumibol Adulyedej (Phuket Gazette 2004).<br/><br/>The Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery is managed under national Papua New Guinean laws and regulations, and there are some seasonal closures in place; although bycatch reduction devices are not currently in place, there are plans to implement in the near future (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm. 2015).",Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
68618306,41797,Hemitrygon fluviorum,Near Threatened,A2cd,2021,2021-02-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Estuary Stingray (<em>Hemitrygon fluviorum</em>) is endemic to northern and eastern Australia where it ranges from Darwin, Northern Territory to Wagonga Inlet, southern New South Wales. It is demersal in freshwater, mangrove-fringed rivers, estuaries, and shallow inshore waters at depths &lt;40 m. It appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence and probably limited habitat.<br/><br/>This species is a very minor bycatch of prawn trawl fisheries on the Queensland east coast but is not at risk from trawl fisheries across northern Australia as they do not trawl in its shallow inshore habitats. It is both discarded from some commercial fisheries and killed when captured in others. The species is bycatch of recreational fisheries and mostly is destroyed when captured and is persecuted by oyster fishers. <br/><br/>It was reportedly once common in parts of New South Wales, but is now uncommon along the New South Wales coast. There is anecdotal evidence of a historic and more recent decline in abundance and area of occupancy due to nearshore development across ~25% of its range, i.e. across the southern portion of its range. Across the remainder of its range, it is either unfished or lightly fished, and habitat degradation is less of a threat. Taking a precautionary approach which considers the historic and more recent declines in abundance and area of occupancy in part of its range, and that is appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence, it is suspected that the Estuary Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (52 years) due to a decline levels of exploitation and habitat degradation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2cd).","The Estuary Stingray is demersal in shallow inshore waters, mangrove-fringed rivers, and estuaries at depths &lt;40 m (Pogonsoki <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019). It is also known to ascend rivers to beyond the tidal limit (Whitley 1940). It appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence and probably limited habitat. It reaches a maximum size of 93 cm disc width (DW) and possibly up to 160 cm DW, males mature at 41 cm DW and females mature at 63 cm DW (Pierce and Bennett 2010b, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Reproduction is viviparous with litter size unknown, an annual reproductive cycle and a size-at-birth of ~11 cm DW (Pierce and Bennett 2010b). Female age-at-maturity is 13.4 years and maximum age is 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 17.2 years (Pierce and Bennett 2010b).","The species is taken as a minor part of the bycatch in inshore commercial fisheries, including demersal prawn trawl fisheries in New South Wales and Queensland, and by commercial tunnel net in Queensland (Courtney <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jacobsen et al. 2018, P. Kyne unpubl. data 2015). The species has not been recorded in the elasmobranch bycatch of the Northern Prawn Fishery and the Torres Strait Prawn Fishery that operate across northern Australia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2000), likely because of its close inshore shallow water habitat that is not trawled by these two fisheries. It has been reported as a very minor component of all bycatch (&lt;0.1%) in the Queensland East Coast Banana Prawn Trawl Fishery (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2000). It is not utilized commercially with regulations preventing retention in Queensland, and it is discarded. At-vessel mortality (AVM) and post-release mortality for this species is unknown, although AVM it is suspected to be moderate; Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. (2002) found an at-vessel mortality of 53–59% for two species of stingrays captured in the Northern Prawn Fishery. In some inshore commercial fisheries, there is the practice of 'spiking' incidentally caught stingrays (using a metal bar or stick with a sharpened point attached to pierce the animal's chondrocranium and remove it from nets, sorting trays, etc.) that is source of mortality.<br/><br/>The species is a bycatch of inshore recreational line fishing as it readily takes cut fish baits and is thus prone to capture. Incidental capture by recreational fishers is likely a significant threat to the species as fishers often destroy any stingray catches (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002, P. Kyne unpubl. data 2015). The Estuary Stingray has been reported to feed voraciously on farmed oysters (Whitley 1940, Last and Stevens 2009), and is persecuted by commercial shellfish farmers in New South Wales and southern Queensland estuaries.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation and loss are also a threat to this species due to its occurrence in shallow inshore, riverine, and estuarine habitats. There has been significant habitat loss and alteration along parts of the Australian east coast as a result of the reclamation of large areas of shallow muddy tidal bays and mangroves for the development of urban areas, canal estates, marinas, and large-scale developments such as the Port of Brisbane and Brisbane Airport expansions. For example, over 20% of the original mangrove habitat of Moreton Bay in southern Queensland has been lost to such development since European settlement (Greenwood 1993).","This species was once considered common, but there is anecdotal evidence of a decline in abundance and area of occupancy for this species in parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2003). Historic accounts report that the Estuary Stingray was an extremely common species in the bays and estuaries of New South Wales and southern Queensland. It has not been reported from Port Jackson and Botany Bay, New South Wales, where it was once common, since the 1880s. In more recent years, i.e., since 2000, it has been reported on the central New South Wales coast (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). Records and occurrence appear to be very patchy, with most records from rivers, estuaries, bays and harbours (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). The species is still locally common in some southern Queensland estuaries and bays (i.e., Hervey Bay, parts of Moreton Bay) (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). It also has been reported to persist in highly modified habitats for long periods of time (&gt;100 years) (Pierce and Bennett 2010a). It is a very minor component of commercial prawn trawl fisheries in Queensland where an ecological risk assessment of the southern Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery assessed this species as at intermediate risk based on its level of resilience to fisheries and the fishing pressure on the species (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is not at risk from prawn trawl fisheries across northern Australia as it is not encountered by those fisheries, likely as they do not trawl in shallow inshore habitats. However, there is no information on population trends across the northern part of its range.<br/><br/>Overall, historic and more recent anecdotal declines in abundance and area of occupancy have occurred in ~25% of its range (the southern part of its range) due to the combined threats of bycatch in commercial fisheries, destruction of incidental catches by recreational fishers and during some commercial fishing activities, persecution by shellfish farmers, and habitat degradation and loss due to nearshore coastal development. Across the rest of its range, bycatch mitigation measures have been in place since 2000, it is either unfished or lightly fished, and habitat degradation is less of a threat. Taking a precautionary approach and considering the historic and more recent declines in abundance and area of occupancy in the southern part of its range and that is appears to be an ecological specialist with a very patchy occurrence, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (52 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in area of occupancy due to habitat degradation.",Decreasing,"The Estuary Stingray is endemic to northern and eastern Australia in the Western Central and Southwest Pacific where it ranges from Darwin, Northern Territory to Wagonga Inlet, southern New South Wales (Pierce and Bennet 2010a, Gladstone <em>et al</em>. 2012, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). It was previously considered to also occur across southern Papua New Guinea and Indonesian West Papua, however these records represent another species, the Merauke Stingay (<em>Hemitrygon longicauda</em>) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><em></em><em></em>",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"There are no specific conservation actions for the Estuary Stingray. Elasmobranchs cannot be retained in the Queensland prawn trawl fishery or the Northern Prawn Fishery and so incidental captures are discarded. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) is mandated in all Australian prawn trawl fisheries and has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large rays in prawn trawls (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2020); large individual Estuary Stingrays may be excluded from capture. There is a possession limit of one shark or ray for recreational fishers in Queensland. The species likely occurs in a number of marine protected areas in New South Wales and Queensland waters, although zoning plans for these parks and reserves restrict fishing activities in only small areas and do not generally protect sufficient areas of the habitat of this species. The zoning plan for the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland includes closed areas representing 16% of the area of the Park. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><strong></strong>","",,false,false,Global
68619155,41798,Deania calcea,Near Threatened,A2bd,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) deep-water shark known from a&#160;widespread yet patchy global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans.&#160;It occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopes&#160;at depths of 60–1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths &gt;400 m.&#160;The species is&#160;caught as both targeted and incidental catch in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries&#160;operating across most its known range, but the species may find some refuge at depth. There has been a number of management measures implemented in recent years, both species-specific and more generally for deep-water sharks.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but increasing trends in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. The Birdbeak Dogfish is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (90 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Birdbeak Dogfish occurs on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 60–1,600 m, with most individuals recorded at depths &gt;400 m (Neat <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 73–94 cm TL and females mature at 94–106 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter size of 6–12 pups and&#160;size-at-birth is&#160;28–34 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al</em>. 2013).&#160;There are slight regional differences in age parameters. In the Northeast Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 25 years and maximum age is 35 years; resulting in a generation length of 30 years (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2002). In the Southwest Pacific, female age-at-maturity is 21.5 years and maximum age is 37 years; resulting in a generation length of 29.25 years (Irvine<em> et al. </em>2012).","<p>The Birdbeak Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries.<br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Trawl survey records indicate peak depth distribution of the species is also at depths &gt;800 m (Neat&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). At vessel mortality is high, and post release mortality is likely to be high as well (Rodríguez-Cabello&#160;and Sanchez&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the East Central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), and in hake fisheries operating off Chile (SUBPESCA 2017).<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Birdbeak Dogfish to have extreme vulnerability to midwater trawl and demersal longline fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean, and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, the&#160;Birdbeak Dogfish is one of the most deep-water shark species reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Francis 2015), with trawl survey records indicating peak depth distribution at depths &gt;800 m (Anderson <em>et al. </em>1998). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from industrial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018), and <a>a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker, unpubl. data 2019). Any <em>Deania </em>spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013).</a></p>","<p>Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. Population genetics have indicated some genetic variability between populations (Keggin 2017). Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of dogfishes, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp). Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019), and (2) relative abundance in the Southwest Pacific (Walker and Gason 2007,&#160;Francis<em> et al.</em> 2016, Stevens<em> et al. </em>2017, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018, O’Driscoll <em>et al. </em>2018). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths (90 years for the Northeast Atlantic and 87.8 years for the Southwest) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, in the Northeast Atlantic, relative abundance estimates of <em>Deania </em>spp (Birdbeak Dogfish and Arrowhead Dogfish, <em>Deania profundorum</em>) from Spanish and Scottish trawl survey series suggest fluctuating trends since 1983 and 1998, respectively, with some indication of increasing CPUE since 2009 (F. Neat, unpubl. data 2019, ICES-WGEF 2018). Trend analysis of Scottish trawl survey data from 1998 to 2019 revealed an annual rate of increase of 12%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;100% over the past three generation lengths (90 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. Industrial landings of the Birdbeak Dogfish in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~195 t in 2004–05, before rapidly declining to 3 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018). <em>Deania </em>spp were often the most abundant deep-water shark in research surveys (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Second, relative biomass were combined from southeast Australia and surveys from New Zealand Chatham Rise and Sub-Antarctic (Walker and Gason 2007,&#160;Francis<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Stevens<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017, Stevens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, O’Driscoll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The combined relative abundance data indicated declines from 1991 to 2003 followed by an increase in abundance. This increase likely follows the implementation of management measures, including improved reporting. The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 0.07%, consistent with an estimated increase of 7.2% over the three generation lengths (87.8 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. In Australia,&#160;significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of dogfishes (mainly&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp and&#160;<em>Squalus&#160;</em>spp)&#160;from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;Catches of&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp were reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean annual catch estimate of 257 t between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007). In New Zealand,&#160;the Birdbeak Dogfish is considered to have a relatively large sized population (Ford&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s (Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 65% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (87.8 years) for the Birdbeak Dogfish, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/><br/>The Birdbeak Dogfish population is estimated to have increased in the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest Pacific and is suspected to have declined in the Northwest Pacific and West Africa. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median increase was 62.7%, with the highest probability of no major reduction over three generation lengths (90 years). Trends were estimated to be reflective of ~80% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 20–29% is estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Birdbeak Dogfish&#160;has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The species has historically been utilized for its flesh and liver oil (sold as ""pearl shark"" or ""deepsea flake"" in Australia). Fins from <em>Deania </em>spp have been reported&#160;in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Birdbeak Dogfish, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa and South America. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). The species is considered a ""key species of concern"" within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius</em>&#160;spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>In Australia, deep-water sharks, including the Birdbeak Dogfish, are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, divided into eastern and western zone fisheries&#160;(Patterson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). These fisheries are subject to a multi-species&#160;Total Allowable Catches (TACs).

68620350,161637,Dentiraja australis,Near Threatened,A2bd,2021,2021-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Sydney Skate (<em>Dentiraja australis</em>) is a small (to 55 cm total length) skate endemic to eastern Australia and has a relatively restricted distribution. It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 20–325 m. The species is a bycatch of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) where it is taken in several sectors, but mostly in the trawl sector. It used to be discarded due to its small size, but in recent years some larger individuals (adults) may be retained for local markets. When discarded it is suspected to have high survival rates. Trend analysis of relative abundance from catch monitoring in the SESSF indicate an increasing population with the highest probability of no major population reductions over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Previous to the past three generation lengths, fishery independent surveys revealed that catch rates for ""skates"" combined, including the Sydney Skate, declined by 83% between 1976–77 and 1996–97. This indicates dramatic historic declines and that the species is susceptible to fishing pressure. Although fishing pressure has declined over the past three generation lengths and the trend data indicate an increase in population, the data are from a relatively short time series, have a high level of uncertainty, and may not be fully representative of the population trends of this species. Given the species' restricted distribution and taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Sydney Skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).<br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The Sydney Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 20–325 m, but it mostly occurs at depths of 100–199 m (Walker and Gason 2007, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 55 cm total length (TL), males mature at 43–48 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Reproduction is oviparous, like other skates, but little else is known of its biology. Age parameters are inferred from a regional congener, the White-spotted Skate (<em>Dentiraja cerva</em>), that has a female age-at-maturity of 5 years and maximum age of 9 years, resulting in a generation length of 7 years (Treloar 2008).","The Sydney Skate is taken as bycatch in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) (Walker and Gason 2007). It is captured in several sectors, but mostly taken in the trawl sector, and was discarded rather than retained (Walker and Gason 2007) due to its small size. In recent years, some large individuals (adults) have been retained for the meat for local markets. At-vessel mortality and post-release mortality (PRM) is unknown for this species, but based on other skates, it is suspected that when discarded it has a high survival rates. At-vessel mortality for other species of trawled skates has been reported as &lt;1% and mostly &lt;10% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2018), and short-term PRM has been reported to be low with 37–97% of skates surviving for 2–5 days after trawling, though these studies have been with skates kept in tanks rather than released to the wild (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Commercial trawling on the upper slope off New South Wales began in 1968 and by the early 1980s more than 100 trawlers (15–25 m length) were operating off New South Wales in the SESSF, landing ~15,000 t of fish per year. Approximately 60 of these trawlers regularly fished on the upper slope. By the end of the 1990s, the number of trawlers regularly fishing the New South Wales slope grounds in the SESSF had reduced to about 40 (Graham et al. 2001). Since the mid-2000s there has been a further one-third decrease in trawl effort in the SESSF (Emery et al. 2020). Approximately 7.7% of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector within the SESSF is trawled annually (Pitcher <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Sydney Skate has refuge from regular trawling as it occupies large areas of lightly or non-trawled sea floor off central and northern New South Wales, and southern Queensland (Emery et al. 2020, K. Graham pers. comm. 10 October 2007).","The Sydney Skate was the most commonly caught skate on the continental shelf of central eastern Australia (Last and Stevens 2009). Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in southeast Australia (Walker and Gason 2007). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (21 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trawl data from the Integrated Scientific Monitoring Program (ISMP) and from fisher logbooks from 1998–2006 data indicate a rise-peak-decline in catch rates with a peak in 2003 followed by a decline, however overall there was no significant trend in catch (Walker and Gason 2007). The trend analysis of those same data revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.5%, consistent with an estimated increase of 33.3% over three generation lengths (21 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (21 years). The time series is relatively short, however, and there is a high level of uncertainty in the estimated change beyond the 9 years of the time series (Figure 1c, Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Prior to the past three generation lengths (21 years), fishery independent surveys off southern New South Wales indicated that catch rates for ""skates"" combined declined by 83% between 1976–77 and 1996–97 (Graham <em>et al</em>. 1997, Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). Eight species of skates were recorded during the survey, with Sydney Skate dominating catches at depths from 220–275 m (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). Although in the past three generation lengths (21 years) catch monitoring indicated a stable and/or increasing population, prior to that, the previous heavier fishing pressure had resulted in a dramatic decline in skates, including the Sydney Skate, indicating it is susceptible to fishing pressure. Although fishing pressure has since declined, the currently available data is from a short time series and may not be fully representative of the population trends of this species. An ecological risk assessment of the southern Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery assessed this species as at high risk based on its level of resilience to fisheries and the fishing pressure on the species (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Given its restricted distribution and taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (21 years)

Sydney Skate is endemic to eastern Australia between Moreton Bay (Queensland) and Tathra (New South Wales) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b).,"The Sydney Skate was until recently not utilized (Walker and Gason 2007) as it was previously considered too small to be of commercial value. However, there is now an increasing trend for the larger individuals (adults) to be retained for the local market (Last and Stevens 2009).",Marine,"There are currently no specific conservation actions for the Sydney Skate. However, trawl fisheries in its range are under quota management. Fisheries management in Australia now includes ecosystem management and all fisheries now have Bycatch Action Plans, must be assessed for ecological sustainability, and are required to meet certification standards to continue operating. It may receive some refuge in marine protected areas of the Temperate and Southeast Commonwealth Marine Parks Network. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global
68620560,161329,Dentiraja cerva,Near Threatened,A2d,2021,2021-02-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The White-spotted Skate (<em>Dentiraja cerva</em>) is a small (to 66 cm total length) skate endemic to southern Australia. It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 60–470 m. The species is a bycatch of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) where it is taken mostly in the trawl sector. It used to be discarded due to its small size, but in recent years some larger individuals (adults) may be retained for local markets. When discarded it is suspected to have high survival rates. Fishery independent surveys off southern New South Wales revealed that catch rates for ""skates"" combined declined by 83% between 1976–77 and 1996–97. Although these declines do not apply directly to this species because its distribution begins at the southern extent of the survey area, trawling was intense and still occurs throughout the White-spotted Skate's deep-water range off southeast Australia, and it likely also underwent dramatic declines. Fishing pressure has since declined yet is still present and the species is likely highly susceptible to fishing pressure, as evidenced by historic declines in regional congeners with similar depth ranges and life history. The White-spotted Skate has refuge from fishing pressure in non-trawled parts of its southern range. It is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation, and the White-spotted Skate is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The White-spotted Skate is demersal on soft substrates on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 60–470 m, possibly shallower to 20 m (Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 66 cm total length (TL), males mature at 47 cm TL and females mature at 49 cm TL (Treloar 2008). Reproduction is oviparous with a continual reproductive cycle and a size-at-birth of 11 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Female age-at-maturity is 5 years and maximum age is 9 years, resulting in a generation length of 7 years (Treloar 2008).","The White-spotted Skate is taken as bycatch of trawl fisheries operating off southern Australia, particularly in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). The estimated annual catch of the White-spotted Skate in the SESSF between 2000–2006 was ~37 t with &lt;1% retained (Walker and Gason 2007). In recent years some large individuals (adults) have been retained for the meat for local markets. At-vessel mortality and post-release mortality (PRM) is unknown for this species, but based on other skates, it is suspected that it has a high survival rates. At-vessel mortality for other species of trawled skates has been reported as &lt;1% and mostly &lt;10% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2018), and short-term PRM has been reported to be low with 37–97% of skates surviving for 2–5 days after trawling, though these studies have been with skates kept in tanks rather than released to the wild (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The SESSF has operated since the 1900s and targets a number of teleost species that are under quota management, but sustainable catch levels for this skate will be much lower than for the more productive teleost species. Since the mid-2000s there has been a one-third decrease in trawl effort in the SESSF (Emery <em>et al</em>. 2020). Approximately 7.7% of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector within the SESSF is trawled annually (Pitcher <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector, across southern Australia, approximately 50% of the White-spotted Skate's range was not trawled in 2019-2020, providing refuge from fishing pressure in that area (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The species is common in the western part of its range; it is the most abundant skate on the continental shelf in the Great Australian Bight (Last and Stevens 2009). Fishery independent surveys off southern New South Wales indicated that catch rates for ""skates"" combined declined by 83% between 1976–77 and 1996–97 (Graham <em>et al</em>. 1997, Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). These declines do not apply directly to this species because its distribution begins at the southern extent of the survey area (Eden and Gabo). However, trawling was intense and still occurs throughout this species' deep-water range off southeast Australia and there is no reason to suspect that it has not also suffered dramatic declines in this area.<br/><br/>Overall, the species is subject to fishing pressure in the southeast part of its range and although fishing pressure has declined over the past three generation lengths (21 years), the fishing pressure is still present, and the species is likely highly susceptible to fishing pressure, as evidenced by historic declines in regional congeners with similar depth ranges and life history. However, it also has refuge from fishing pressure in non-trawled parts of its more western range. It is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation.<strong></strong>",Decreasing,"The White-spotted Skate is endemic to southern Australia from Gabo Island (Victoria) to the<br/>Recherche Archipelago (Western Australia), including Tasmania (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b).","This species has high quality meat but only a very small percentage was retained during observed catches in 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007, Last and Stevens 2009).

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 110–370 m. The species is taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries across its entire spatial range and depth range in Queensland (Qld), and most of its depth range in New South Wales (NSW). It is discarded due to its small size and regulations preventing retention in Qld. It was reported as common across its range in 1994 but since then, there is no information on the population trend. In Qld, it represents a high proportion of the elasmobranch bycatch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery and although the actual catch rates were low it had high at-vessel mortality. In both Qld and NSW, the trawl fisheries are seasonal and only fish for a few months of the year, providing significant temporal refuge for this species. Despite this temporal refuge, it has a relatively restricted range and when captured appears to have high at-vessel mortality. Taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Endeavour Skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Endeavour Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 110–370 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 37 cm total length (TL), males mature at 30 cm TL and females mature at 32 cm TL (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2008, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Reproduction is oviparous and size-at-birth is 10–11 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Age parameters are inferred from its similar sized sister species, the Argus Skate (<em>Dipturus polyommata</em>), that has a female age-at-maturity of 5.1 years and maximum age of 10 years, resulting in a generation length of 7.6 years (Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2016).","The Endeavour Skate is taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries across its range and is discarded due to its small size and regulations preventing retention in Queensland. In Queensland, the Eastern King Prawn (<em>Melicertus plebejus</em>) sector (deep-water component) of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery operates on the outer continental shelf and upper slope to depths of 300–350 m off southern Queensland (Courtney <em>et al</em>. 2007). In surveys of the fishery on the outer continental shelf, the Endeavour Skate was the most common elasmobranch bycatch species comprising 36% of the elasmobranch catch by number (Kyne 2008, Kyne 2010). While the overall catch rate was low (0.029±0.007 individuals ha-1), at-vessel mortality was high (79% of individuals landed on deck were dead). It should be noted that these observations were made with fishery-independent sampling employing short trawl shots of about one hour trawl time, whereas regular commercial trawls last far longer (Kyne 2008). This fishery operates over much of the Queensland geographic range of the species but is highly seasonal, with the vast majority of effort generally occurring during the months of May to August. Outside these months, vessels fish in shallower waters where this species does not occur.<br/><br/>Similarly, in northern New South Wales, outer shelf depths (~100–200 m) are trawled only for a short season targeting Eastern King Prawns, and generally on fairly restricted fishing grounds (K. Graham pers. comm. 10 October 2010). Information on the bycatch of skates is lacking, but it is most probable that this species is a component of bycatch since its range overlaps with that of the fishery. Northern New South Wales receives little trawling effort in the extent of occurrence of this species on the upper continental slope (K. Graham pers. comm. 10 October 2010), and as such, it may have some refuge there at the deeper extent of its bathymetric range.","The Endeavour Skate was reported as common throughout its range (Last and Stevens 1994), but since 1994 there is no new information on its population trend. Trawl fisheries operate across its entire spatial range and depth range in Queensland, and most of its depth range in New South Wales. This species represents a high proportion of the elasmobranch bycatch, at least in Queensland, and though the overall catch rate was low, the at-vessel mortality was high. Both fisheries are seasonal and only fish for a few months of the year, providing significant temporal refuge for this species. An ecological risk assessment of the southern Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery assessed this species as at high risk based on its level of resilience to fisheries and the fishing pressure on the species (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Given its relatively restricted range and taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Endeavour Skate is endemic to eastern Australia in the Western Central and Southwest Pacific Ocean with a relatively restricted range from off Fraser Island, Queensland (25°27’S) south to near Crowdy Head, New South Wales (32°20’S) (Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b).",This skate is not traded as it is too small to be of commercial value.,Marine,"No species-specific conservation actions are currently in place.

It occurs on a narrow band of the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope at depths of 117-330 m (based on Australian records). The deeper water nature of this species is unique amongst <em>Myliobatis</em> species, which are generally inshore species.&#160;The small number of records of this species throughout much of its range suggests that this is a naturally rare species (or not regularly exposed to fishing gear).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is high in some areas of its range, e.g. eastern Australia, and Taiwan (possibly also the Philippines), but overall the level of exploitation is not thought to be excessive throughout its known range. However, given that this species is likely naturally rare, its common occurrence in Taiwanese trawl landings may suggest that the catch of this species is unsustainable in this country and this requires investigation. The Purple Eagle Ray is assessed as Near Threatened globally based on an inferred population reduction of &lt;30% over the last 47 years (three generations) due to locally high mortality for a naturally rare species in Taiwan and eastern Australia, nested within a larger geographic range where there are lower levels of mortality.","The Purple Eagle Ray is benthic on the outer continental shelf and upper slope, recorded from depths of 117-330 m in Australian waters (museum records and K. Graham, pers. comm., 2006) with information on depth ranges lacking from outside of Australia. This species attains at least 114 cm disc width (DW) (White <em>et al</em>. 2015). Two males of 48 cm DW were adolescent, and males between 56 and 80 cm DW were mature (White <em>et al</em>. 2015). Female size at maturity, size at birth and litter size unknown.","The Purple Eagle Ray is considered to be a naturally rare species (as indicated by the low catches throughout most of its range), and despite many decades of survey work along the east coast of Australia, it is rarely observed there. The Cape Moreton area (where the holotype is from) receives relatively significant levels of trawling for eastern king prawn by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF). The Swain Reefs (Coral Sea) specimen was collected from champagne lobster trawl bycatch; this area is subject to only low fishing pressure. Its area of occurrence off New South Wales has been  subject to heavy trawling activity for a considerable number of years (Graham <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;Fishing pressure is very low at the locations and habitat where the Purple Eagle Ray has been recorded from in Western Australia (Marton and Mazur 2014a, 2014b).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, the distribution of this species is mainly on the the outer shelf or upper slope (based on species composition of catches). No trawling occurs at those depths in these areas so although fishing pressure is very high in Indonesia in general, fishing pressure specifically on the Purple Eagle Ray appears to be relatively low. In the Philippines, seven juvenile and adult specimens were recorded from several fish markets in 1999 and 2000 (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005), but information on the fishing gear, habitats fished and ongoing threats in not known. In Taiwan, there is intensive trawling on the outer shelf and upper slope which represents a threat to this species in those waters and it is regularly seen in the landings (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).","There is no information on the population size of the Purple Eagle Ray, but it has a patchy distribution and appears to be naturally rare where it occurs. It has a deeper water habit compared to its congeners and there are no records of it forming aggregations as in some other species of eagle rays.<br/><br/>Given the historical high levels of fishing on the New South Wales outer shelf and upper slope  and off southern Queensland,&#160;it is possible that this species was  affected early on by fishing activities and now we are seeing only a  depleted population in eastern Australia. However, this is speculation and given it appears to be rare throughout   its patchy distribution, it is more likely that it is just a naturally   rare species. Of 13 specimens taken by the New South Wales &#160;Fisheries research vessel <em>Kapala</em>, nine were collected at the  beginning of surveying (1976 to 1979) while four were collected in the  later years of surveying (up until 1997) (K.

68636040,60150,Neotrygon annotata,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Plain Maskray (<em>Neotrygon annotata</em>) is found in northern Australia from the Gulf of Carpentaria through to Western Australia, and in the Gulf of Papua (New Guinea). Its occurrence in the Torres Strait has yet to be confirmed and further investigations are required into the presence of this species in Indonesian waters. It has a limited depth range on the continental shelf of Australia (12-62 m) and is more prominent in deeper waters.<br/><br/>This maskray is a small batoid (attains 45 cm disc width) with a low fecundity (1-3 pups per litter). The Plain Maskray is considered to be a less abundant species when compared to the Bluespotted Maskray (<em>N. kuhlii</em> species-complex) and the Peppered Maskray (<em>N. picta</em>). Its centre of abundance is the Northwest Shelf off Western Australia, which is an area that has historically been under intensive fishing pressure, particularly from foreign demersal trawlers operating in the area from 1959 until the early 1990s. These activities more than likely had a detrimental effect on regional benthic batoid populations, although no data exist to substantiate this claim. Animals captured during a trawl event are susceptible to injury (internal and external) and post-release survival rates for this species are expected to be low.<br/><br/>The species continues to be caught as bycatch in Australian demersal trawl fisheries (particularly for prawns) and more information is required on current catch and mortality rates. Additional information is also required on the catch of this species in New Guinea and the effect of commercial fisheries there. This is considered to be of particular importance given that this species has a small distribution when compared to other batoids. Given this batoid's low fecundity, small depth and geographic range, and historical and current (mostly unmonitored) fishing pressures, the Plain Maskray is assessed as Near Threatened (suspected to be close to meeting the 30% threshold for Vulnerable A2d). Any increase in fishing pressure in the region could further affect the species and this situation should be monitored.","The Plain Maskray inhabits continental shelf waters between 12 and 62 m (Last and Stevens 2009), although the species is more prominent in deeper water environments. While the species can reach up to 45 cm disc width (DW), it is more commonly encountered at smaller sizes. It is typically found in environments with sandy or soft substrates (Jacobsen and Bennett 2012).<br/><br/>This species likely has an annual reproductive cycle (Jacobsen 2007), producing 1-3 embryos (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). Size at birth is 12-14 cm DW (Last and Stevens 2009) with the smallest recorded free-living animal measured at 13.7 cm DW (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). Age and size at 50% maturity is estimated to be four years and 20.4 cm DW in males and 3-4 years and 19.1 cm DW for females (Jacobson and Bennett 2010). Size at first sexual maturity is 19.2 cm DW in males and 18.4 cm DW in females (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). Males are estimated to live to at least 9 years and females to at least 13 years, both with an estimated maximum size of 45.2 cm DW (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002). Generation length is calculated as 8.5 years based on the above female age at maturity and maximum age figures.","The geographic range of the Plain Maskray incorporates areas that have a long history of demersal trawl fishing activities. For example, the Northwest Shelf and the Timor Sea (centre of abundance of this species) has been the focus of demersal trawl fisheries since 1959 which on occasion included Japanese, Taiwanese and Chinese fishing fleets. The Northwest Shelf in particular has been the subject of intensive trawl fishing activities, namely from Taiwanese pair trawlers that operated in the area from the 1970s until the early 1990s. While no data on batoid catch and mortality rates is available for this period, it is highly likely these fishing activities had a negative effect on regional portions of the Plain Maskray population.<br/><br/>With regards to the capture of this species, the bottom-dwelling nature of the Plain Maskray (as with a number of batoids) makes it highly susceptible to demersal trawl fishing activities. Furthermore, the Plain Maskray is a relatively small species whose body frame is less robust when compared to the Bluespotted Maskray species-complex. As a consequence, the effectiveness of bycatch reduction devices including turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) will be limited as this species can pass more easily through the bars of a TED and into the codend of a trawl net. Once captured within the net the species will be at risk of incurring both internal and external injuries during the trawl event and during the net recovery phase. Given this, post-release survival rates for this species are expected to be low.<br/><br/>The geographic distribution of the Brown Stingray overlaps with a large proportion of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) where it is caught and subsequently discarded as bycatch. Bycatch estimates for the fishery (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tonks <em>et al</em>. 2007) identified the Plain Maskray as the most abundant species of elasmobranch caught in the western region of the NPF (Joseph Bonaparte Gulf) where it comprised between 40% and 67% of the total elasmobranch catch. At a whole-of fishery level, NPF effort is focused principally on areas of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the northern coasts of Bathurst Island/Tiwi Islands (Northern Territory) and the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. Of which, the western region of the Gulf of Carpentaria has the highest concentration of effort (Larcombe and Skirton 2014).<br/><br/>In addition to the above, the Plain Maskray would more than likely interact with the 'Demersal Fishery' in northern Australia; a multi-faceted commercial fishery that incorporates a range of fishing methods such as traps, lines and finfish trawl. Of these apparatuses used, the Plain Maskray would most likely interact with the finfish trawl fishery. This component of the fishery has eight licenses and effort is restricted to two defined areas; a relatively small area southwest of Bathurst Island (Northern Territory) and a larger area starting east of Darwin and extending southeast into the Gulf of Carpentaria. When compared, effort in the demersal finfish trawl fishery (980 boat days) is much smaller than the NPF suggesting the effect of this fishery on the Plain Maskray population is less. Despite this, the cumulative impact of these fisheries (NPF and the finfish trawl fishery) in the western Gulf of Carpentaria may be a factor of regional significance. However, this risk will be difficult to quantify as there is limited information on elasmobranch bycatch compositions and distributions in the demersal finfish trawl fishery.<br/><br/>Further west, there is potential for the Plain Maskray to be caught in the North Coast Prawn Fisheries and the Pilbara Fish Trawl Fishery which operates in the southwest margins of this species' known distribution. Again, there is limited information on elasmobranch bycatch in these (comparatively small) fisheries with the Plain Maskray yet to be reported from bycatch surveys in the area (Western Australian Government 2010). The effect of these fisheries is anticipated to be less than the NPF.<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, a prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea. The Plain Maskray is caught in low numbers as bycatch in this fishery (W. White, pers. comm., 2015).",Currently there is no information available on population size or trend. However population reduction is suspected to have occurred over the last three generations (see the Rationale section for more details).,Unknown,"The Plain Maskray is found in Australia and Papua New Guinea including the Arafura Sea and Timor Sea. The Australian distribution extends from the Gulf of Carpentaria (Queensland) through the Northern Territory to at least the Bonaparte Archipelago, Western Australia (Last and Stevens 2009). Specimens from New Guinea have also been reported from bycatch surveys in the Gulf of Papua (W. White, pers. comm. 2015). This species has yet to be recorded in the Torres Strait (Pitcher <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jacobsen and Bennett 2010), although the presence of this maskray in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Gulf of Papua suggests it may inhabit these areas, albeit more sparingly. While a single Plain Maskray specimen was observed in East Java (Indonesia), the original catch location was not known (W. White, pers. comm., 2015). As such, further investigations are required into the presence of this species in Indonesia.<br/><br/>When compared to other maskray species, the distribution of this maskray overlaps with the Bluespotted Maskray (<em>N. kuhlii</em> species-complex), the Painted Maskray (<em>N. leylandi</em>) and the Peppered Maskray (<em>N. picta</em>). There appears to be no obvious depth partitioning between these species, although the Plain Maskray is rarely taken in the coastal zone and generally occurs further offshore. The extent of any overlap between the distributions of the Plain Maskray and the Ningaloo Maskray (<em>N. ningalooensis</em>) is currently unknown and requires further investigation.",This species is not known to be utilized.,Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for the Plain Maskray. The species will derive some benefit from broader management initiatives including fisheries-based spatial and temporal closures and the use of bycatch reduction devices. However, research has shown that bycatch reduction devices including turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) are less effective for smaller species (Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the effectiveness of fisheries closures (spatial and temporal) will be dependent on their location and the proportion of the Plain Maskray population protected from fishing effort. However, this cannot be quantified from the data currently available.<br/><br/>The Gulf of Papua trawl the fishery is managed under national laws and regulations (PNG), and there are some seasonal closures in place; although bycatch reduction devices are not currently in place, there are plans to implement in the near future (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm. 2015). Detailed species composition data for the bycatch is not currently available, but this is currently being investigated (L.

There are well documented collapses of upper slope deepwater sharks off southeastern Australia, with a high likelihood that the Prickly Dogfish has declined due to long histories of trawling where it occurs. This species is susceptible to capture, and mortality of discards is unknown but are considered high. <em>Oxynotus</em>&#160;spp are highly susceptible to population decline from fishing,&#160;and populations of other species in the Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic&#160;have declined by an estimated 80% over three generations, or disappeared altogether, in areas with high fishing effort. There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for Prickly Dogfish, and it is unknown what effect, if any, current fisheries and closed area management strategies have for this species.<br/><br/>Based on its low productivity, susceptibility to capture, high fishing overlap through much of its range with documented upper slope shark declines in some areas, a population decline of 20-30% is inferred over the last three generations (60 years) based on actual levels of exploitation. The Prickly Dogfish is therefore listed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","<p>The Prickly Dogfish has been recorded on the upper continental slope and plateaus at depths of 45-1,067 m, but most commonly occurs at 300-650 m (Francis 2003, Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of ~76 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~55 cm TL; females mature at 64 cm TL; size at birth 25-27 cm TL (Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous and is likely asynchronous; litter size is eight, but annual fecundity is unknown (Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016). Productivity is assumed to be low (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008, Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016), and like other <em>Oxynotus </em>spp, the generation length is estimated to be 20 years (Soldo and Guallart 2015).<br/></p>","The Prickly Dogfish is taken incidentally in deepwater benthic trawl fisheries in both Australia (Walker and Gason 2007) and New Zealand (Francis 2015). In Australia, this species is recorded from the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery (GABTF) and South East Trawl Fishery (SETF) (Walker and Gason 2007), which were amalgamated into the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark fishery (SESSF) in 2003. In volume, the SESSF is the largest Commonwealth fishery, and fishing overlaps heavily with the depth range of Prickly Dogfish (Georgeson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Its unique body morphology may increase its susceptibility to capture (Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016, Soldo and Guallart 2016), and while mortality from capture is unknown, it is considered high (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>Most records of Prickly Dogfish in New Zealand are from Chatham Rise (Francis 2003), an area of major commercial importance (O’Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011). From 1989/90 to 2010/11, approximately 85% of trawl effort within New Zealand waters occurred at depths of 0-800 m (Black and Tilney 2015), which overlaps with the core depth range of Prickly Dogfish in New Zealand waters. It was estimated that this species is susceptible to fishing across 45-60% of its New Zealand range most of the year (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The Prickly Dogfish has a highly specialized diet of chondrichthyan eggs, and modification of the habitat of its prey species by deepwater fishing or mining may heighten its threat level (Leduc <em>et al</em>. 2015, Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species at moderate risk (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the Australian SESSF ranked this species with moderate risk from commercial fishing (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008).","Accurate population size and trends are unknown for this species. In New Zealand, Prickly Dogfish is considered to have a moderate population size (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). Biomass estimates from trawl survey indices in New Zealand are poorly estimated, show no clear trends, and catch rates are low (O'Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bagley <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Australia, this species is considered to be of moderate relative abundance (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, catch rates of this species have been, and continued to be, low despite complete depth distribution overlap with the main trawl grounds of the Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) (K. Graham, pers. comm., Knuckey <em>et al</em>. 2015). Biomass data from fisheries-independent surveys in the SESSF indicate that only a few individuals are caught in each survey, and these cannot be used to show any trends (data provided by Australian Fisheries Management Authority 18/08/2017). Over a 20 year period (1976/77-1996/97), substantial declines (in some cases &gt;90%) of relative abundance of deepwater chondrichthyans on the upper slope of southeast Australia have been previously reported (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). Species-specific trends for Prickly Dogfish during this time are not available, but it is inferred that this species has declined off southeast Australia.<br/><br/><em>Oxynotus </em>spp are highly susceptible to population decline from fishing, and populations in the Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic have declined by an estimated 80% over three generations (60 years), or disappeared altogether, in areas with high fishing effort (Soldo and Guallart 2015, Soldo and Guallart 2016). With the core depth distribution of Prickly Dogfish subject to trawling across most of its range, the extent of decline is inferred to be 20-30% over the last three generations (60 years) based on actual levels of exploitation, and documented declines in a variety of upper slope species.",Unknown,"<p>The Prickly Dogfish is known from southern Australia and New Zealand waters in the Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian. In Australia, it has been recorded from Newcastle in New South Wales to the western Great Australian Bight (Last and Stevens 2009). In New Zealand, it is widespread throughout mainland New Zealand and Stewart Island-Snares Island Shelf, Chatham Rise, Challenger Plateau, and Campbell Plateau (Roberts <em>et al</em>. 2015). One specimen was filmed from the summit of the Rumble V Submarine Volcano, southern Kermadec Ridge (Gordon 2013).<span lang=""EN-AU""><br/></p><p></p>","<p>This species is not likely to be utilized, and has historically been discarded (Walker and Gason 2007, Ministry of Fisheries 2008).<br/></p>",Marine,"Further information is required on the life history, population, and fisheries interactions of Prickly Dogfish. Although no species-specific management is in place, some management arrangements in New Zealand and Australia are relevant to this species.<br/><br/>New Zealand has had a Quota Management System (QMS) in place since 1986 to provide for the sustainable management of its fisheries. Prickly Dogfish is a non-QMS species, meaning that there is no species-specific management in place for the species (MPI 2013). New Zealand has a system of Benthic Protected Areas (BPAs), however they are unlikely to provide any major refuge for this species given the spatial occurrence of the BPAs (see Black and Tilney 2015). This species has been recorded from the Kermadec Ridge where no benthic trawling occurs (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In Australia, trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2016) may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region. However, this is beyond the core depth range of the species.

The species is possibly taken as bycatch in the Queensland Deepwater Fin Fish Fishery that uses droplines and trotlines, where dogfishes have been recorded but not identified to species (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013). In southern Queensland, a developmental deepwater trawl fishery at 250-800 m may take the Eastern Longnose Spurdog as bycatch (Department of Environment 2016). In northern Queensland and in the Commonwealth-managed Coral Sea Fishery, there is minimal deepwater trawling with no trawl operations reported in the Coral Sea Fishery since the 2006/07 fishing season (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","Over a 20 year period (1976/77 to 1996/97), fisheries-independent surveys reported documented declines of ~97% of ""greeneye dogsharks"" (comprising the Shortspine Spurdog<em> </em>(<em>Squalus mitsukurii</em>),&#160;and the Eastern Longnose Spurdog between the Sydney (central New South Wales, NSW) and Eden-Gabo Island area (southern NSW/northern Victoria) (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001).&#160;This area represents ~20% of the known range of the Eastern Longnose Spurdog. Based on actual levels of exploitation and documented declines, it is estimated and suspected that the species has been subject to ~20% population decline over the last three generations (66 years).<br/><br/>Total catches of ""greeneye dogsharks"" in these survey areas at depths of 220-605 m (much of the known depth range of the two species) declined from a mean of 44.8 kg/h in 1976/77 to a mean of 1.2 kg/h in 1996/97 (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). In 1976/77, the two species were caught in approximately equal numbers off Sydney and Ulladulla, thus, it is a fair assumption that the decline was roughly equal for both species in these areas. The 1976/77 Eden data suggested 75% or more of the ""greeneye dogshark"" catch in the southern area comprised of the Shortspine Spurdog&#160;and thus, a relatively small proportion of the Eastern Longnose Spurdog. However, in 1996/97, no Eastern Longnose Spurdog were caught off Eden-Gabo Island, suggesting that trawling to the north may have prevented recruitment of the species into southern NSW.",Decreasing,"<p>The Eastern Longnose Spurdog is endemic to eastern Australia in the Western Central and Southwest Pacific Ocean, where it has been recorded from off Bermagui (New South Wales) to Cape York (Queensland) (Last <em>et al.</em> 2007, Last and Stevens 2009).</p>",The species has historically been discarded due to its small size (Graham 2005).,Marine,"There are currently no species-specific conservation measures in place for the Eastern Longnose Spurdog.

The Common Stingaree is a regular discarded bycatch of otter trawlers and Danish seiners in the southern part of its range in the Commonwealth-managed Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) (Walker and Gason 2007). In southern Queensland, the northern extent of the species' range, it is taken as bycatch in the Eastern King Prawn (EKP) sector of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF). This is one of the most common elasmobranch bycatch species in this sector of the fishery and catch data indicates that the species aggregates with nursery areas overlapping with trawling grounds (Kyne <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, 2016, P. Kyne unpublished data).&#160;In New South Wales, the species is a bycatch of the Ocean Prawn Trawl  Fishery, as well as in inshore and estuarine trawl fisheries, estuarine prawn seine fisheries, and beach seine fisheries (Gray <em>et al</em>. 1990, Gray and Kennelly 2003, Gray <em>et al</em>.  2003). Given its inshore occurrence, this species is occasionally taken by recreational beach anglers (P. Kyne pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Where the species is taken as bycatch, a concern is the demonstrated low post-release survivorship of trawl caught individuals (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2018), and the fact that urolophids frequently abort pups upon capture and handling; even if gravid females survived capture, their reproductive output can be lost (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Trinnie&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Adams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;<br/><br/><br/>The effects of inshore and coastal habitat degradation on this species  are unknown but it may be less affected through habitat modification  than other species (for example, the Estuary Stingray <em>Hemitrygon</em>&#160;<em style="""">fluviorum</em>) as it is still common in relatively degraded areas (i.e., areas around Sydney).","No data are available on population size and structure of the Common Stingaree, but this species is considered abundant across its range. Trend from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) between 2001 and 2006 was indeterminable (Walker and Gason 2007). Fishery-independent trawl surveys comparing chondrichthyan bycatch between 1976/77 and 1996/97 off the upper slope of New South Wales documented an overall decline in the catch rate of urolophids of ~66%, and up to ~90% on one survey ground (Graham&#160;<em>et al. </em>2001).

When applying an age at first reproduction of 1 year and longevity of 5 years, its estimated generation length is 3 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","This species is overfished in several parts of its range, including Pakistan, western India, Bangladesh and China&#160;(Kalhoro <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sarker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Liang and Pauly 2017). It is also impacted by estuarine degradation (i.e., pollution and coastal development), which occurs throughout its range (Sun&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Hasin 2016). It has been found with high concentrations of heavy metals in Digha, India (Kumar<em> et al.</em> 2012).","This species can be common and abundant in estuaries through much of its range (Nugroho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Landings data for 'Bombay Duck' have been reported to the FAO by Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Indonesia, with India reporting the large majority overall. From 1950-2016, landings have generally been on an increasing trend over the entire time period; however, landings declined by 24% in the most recent years available from 277,119 tons in 2013 to 211,004 t in 2016. Over the entire time series, landings reached a peak in 2008 at 280,396 t and declined over the three subsequent years until peaking again in 2013, which may indicate that landings fluctuate somewhat, but may continue on an overall increasing trend into the near future given that effort is also known to be increasing, or may maintain a declining trend as several stocks are now considered overfished. Landings from China are apparently reported to FAO lumped with other lizardfish species, which peaked in 1992 at 20,010 t and declined thereafter to 5,280 in 2016, which is a 74% decline over a 24-year period.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean: </strong>In Pakistan, this species has been heavily exploited along the Sindh coast by commercial trawl fisheries since at least 1985, and since the 1960s by subsistence fishers (Krishnaya 1968). It is currently considered overfished in Pakistan, where from 1995-2009 (a 14-year period), catch peaked at 101 tons in 1996 and declined to 44 t in 2009, which represents a 56% decline. Catch per unit effort during that same time period declined by 65%, from 0.0091&#160;in 1996 to 0.00.32 in 2009&#160;(Kalhoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). This species can be common and abundant in the Sundarbans (Mukherjee <em>et al. </em>2013), and is very important to fisheries along the northwest and northeast coasts of India. The stock on the west coast is thought to be separate from the east, where there are two stocks (Pazhayamadom <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2013, overall catch of this species in India was 124,509 tons, which comprised 4-5% of the annual marine landings across the country (Behera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). It has been exploited by commercial fisheries in the Saurashtra region of India since at least 1947 (Fernandez and Devaraj 1996), where it comprised 24% of total fisheries catches from 1980-1984 and 13% from 2002-2006 (Ghosh 2014). It is currently considered overfished in the Saurashtra region of India, where from 1997-2011 (a 15-year period), catch peaked at 78,000 tons in 1998 and declined to 25,000 t in 2009, which represents a 68% decline. Catch per unit effort during that same time period declined by 73%, from 45 kg/h<sup>-1</sup> in 1997 to 12 kg/h<sup>-1</sup> in 2009 (Ghosh<em> et al</em>. 2009, Mohammed Koya <em>et al.</em> 2017). Fishing effort in Saurashtra expanded to deeper waters over time as the inshore areas were overfished (Ghosh 2014). It is also considered overfished in the Kakdwip region of West Bengal (Behera&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). By comparison, the fishery for this species in east India developed later than that on the west coast, and catch has been increasing with effort from at least 1960 to 2006 with no indications of decline as of yet (Vivekanandan and Krishnakumar 2010). According to stock assessments, this species has been overfished in Bangladesh since at least the early 1990s (Mustafa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994, Islam 1995, Mustafa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998), or over about the past three decades (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The large quantities of juveniles captured in the fishery also contributes to overfishing (Sarker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Mohammed Koya<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017). For example, in the Sunderbans, 59% of the catch of this species comprised immature individuals (Sharma 2014). Fishing effort has increased considerably in recent years (Hasin 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Western Pacific Ocean:</strong> Growth overfishing is also occurring for this species in China's coastal seas (Liang and Pauly 2017), where catches are now dominated by 0-1 year old fish (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is common and abundant off the coast of Zhejiang, China in the East China Sea (Shan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sambou <em>et al</em>. 2016) and in the Pearl River Estuary of South China (Sun <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual national catch of this species in Indonesia has been recorded since 1976, and catch peaked in 1983 at about 17,000 tons and declined thereafter by about 79% to 3,500 t in 2012, which is a period of 29 years (Nugroho <em>et al.</em> 2015). In North Kalimantan, Indonesia, this species has been heavily exploited since the 1990s, and there are anecdotal reports from the fishing industry that landings and body size of individuals in the catch has been declining since the early 2000s (Prasetyo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, the stock is considered fully exploited in that area, and further increases in fishing effort would likely lead to overfishing (Nugroho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/>When calculated over a three generation period (10 years), data represent a decline in global landings of c.30%. Given that effort is either increasing or stable across much of the fished range, there is evidence of growth overfishing, and data shows severe historic declines, the actual decline in global population of this species highly likely to be close to Vulnerable thresholds under Criterion A2.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is known from scattered localities in the Indo-Pacific from the Arabian Sea (Pakistan) to the Bay of Bengal to Indonesia, the South and East China Seas and the Yellow Sea.

Catch from India is also exported in dried form (Hasin 2016). It is also taken in the commercial trawl fisheries that operate in the coastal areas of China (Liang and Pauly 2017). Subsistence and small-scale commercial trawl fisheries also exploit this species in Riau East Sumatra, East Kalimantan and West Papua, Indonesia (Nugroho <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Traditionally, the Queen Triggerfish has been underutilized by fisheries off the southeastern continental U.S.A., but it is more abundant in the Caribbean and comprises a considerable portion of reef fish landings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Since a large part of its range occurs off northeastern North America, where fishing pressure is suspected to be lower, we infer that global population declines are less than, but likely approaching, what was recently observed for <em>B. capriscus</em> (31-32% over three generation lengths).

It is also found on shallow sandy or grassy areas (Randall 1967) to the upper slope of the deep reef (100 m) (Aiken 1975). It forms schools but may also be observed solitary over sandy and grassy habitats. The Queen Triggerfish is found in depths from 2-275 m, however it is more commonly seen at 10-98 feet (3-30 m). It displays marked movement from the shallows to deeper water with increasing size (Aiken 1975). <em>Diadema antillarum </em>has been reported to be the primary prey item for this species, after mass mortality of the sea urchin in the Caribbean, crabs and chitons were recorded to replace the sea urchin (Reinthal <em>et al</em>. 1984). Prey items include macroalgae, bivalves, crabs, starfish, sea cucumbers, shrimp, and polychaetes. Male Queen Triggerfish establish territories of approximately 10 m in diameter, attracting several females. Nests are built in the sand by moving fins rapidly or creating a current by blowing water with the mouth near the bottom to create sand bowls. The eggs are released into these bowls after a courtship ritual. The nest is defended by the mating pair, reproduction occurs year-round, peaking in the fall and again in the winter. In Jamaica, fishes with ripe gonads were reported in February and May (Munro <em>et al</em>. 1973). Ripe fishes were collected all through the year except in April and June. Maxima of spawning were found between January and February and the period August to October. Most of the species specimens were small maturing individuals, suggesting movement into deeper water in maturation (Aiken 1975). There is indirect evidence of this species forming spawning aggregations from the Netherlands Antilles, St. Croix, and Puerto Rico (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The maximum length: 60.0 cm (TL), (Randall 1968); mean length at 1st maturity: 23-27 cm (FL) (Aiken 1975); maximum age: 7 years (Manooch and Drennon 1987); 16 years in Central Brazil (Albuquerque <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Jamaica (Aiken 1975) size at 1st maturity (males): 17.5 cm (FL); size at 1st maturity (females): 16.5 cm (FL); size at full recruitment: 23-24 cm (FL).<br/><br/>In Brazil, growth parameters: L∞ = 50.4 cm, K = 0.76 (1/year). The natural mortality coefficient (M) = 1.15, while the fishery mortality coefficient (F) =1.49. The exploitation rate estimated (0.56) for this study indicate that this species was under fishery pressure since the fishery exploitation coefficient was superior to what this population can stand, in spite of the fact that the growth parameters were bigger now than in previous studies done in the central region of Brazil (Freitas Netto and Madeira di Beneditto 2010). Maximum age determined by marginal increment analysis of dorsal spines off the Central Coast of Brazil was 16 years, with maximum fork length of 460 mm (Albuquerque <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The generation length for this species was based on that of <em>Balistes capriscus</em>, which was estimated at 4-8 years. Thus, the time window for calculating population declines is 12-24 years.","The species is taken as bycatch in commercial long-line and vertical line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. There is evidence of population declines from fishing observed in Brazil (Freitas Netto and Madeira di Beneditto 2010).

It is taken in small numbers as bycatch in the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery; it most frequently is taken by long-line, but also by hand-line (Scott-Denton <em>et al</em>. 2011). In deep-reef surveys in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, this species co-occurred with the commercially important <em>B. capriscus</em> (which was among the top 25 most abundant species) at deep reefs with live coral cover ranging in depths from 45-85 meters (Weaver <em>et al</em>. 2006).

This species is not targeted by fisheries in this region (Kellison <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong><em>Caribbean Sea</em></strong><br/>Traditionally, the Queen Triggerfish has been underutilized by fisheries off the southeastern continental U.S.A., but it is more abundant in the Caribbean and comprises a considerable portion of reef fish landings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Although the species is taken by both traps and hook and line, 95% of all Queen Triggerfish landings from the U.S.Virgin Islands in 1983-1984 were taken in traps. The Queen Triggerfish comprises ~ 22% by weight of the total trap catch of the Islands and 10-15% of the total landings (Manooch and Drennon 1987). Traps in algal plains in the U.S. Virgin Islands contained the most fish, and 50% of censused <em>B. vetula</em> (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>In Jamaica, the highest catch rate was at the Pedro Cays between 11 to 20 m depth where it comprised nearly 60% of the total catch by number and 52.41% by weight. In general, this species comprised, by both number and weight, the most abundant of all species caught in traps at all parts of Pedro Bank. A very rough estimate of numerical CPUE in unexploited areas averaged in terms of depth zones amounts to 2,900 fishes/1,000 hexagonal trap-nights. If natural mortality rate is 2.6, the mean recruitment index, R, for Pedro Bank is about 7,500 fish (Aiken 1975).<br/><br/>Commercial catches from the U.S. Virgin Islands ranged from approximately 90,000 to 130,000 lbs from 2000 to 2008. In Puerto Rico, commercial catches ranged from approximately 33,000 lbs to 122,000 lbs from 1988 to 2009, averaging 70,000 since 2000. It is taken as by-catch in commercial long-line and vertical line fisheries, and is a component of small-scale fisheries (Heyman <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is also harvested in recreational fisheries.<br/><br/><strong><em>Brazil<br/></em></strong>In small villages of Brazil, parts of this fish are used in traditional medicine in the treatment of asthma, ear aches, and stroke victims. In Brazil, capture production for this species occurs in the states of Ceara and Espirito Santo, with the latter comprising the biggest national harvest at 4,225 tons/year. Fishery statistics report by IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency) indicate a decrease in the national production between the years 2001 (7,774 tons/year) and 2006 (732 tons/year) (IBAMA 2006). Despite the decrease in landings, effort has increased by 25% in Espirito Santo and by 16.5% in Bahia State (Santos 2005). The exploitation rate estimated (0.56) for this study indicates that this species was under fishery pressure since the fishery exploitation coefficient was superior to what this population can stand, in spite of the fact that the growth parameters were bigger now than in previous studies done in the central region of Brazil (Freitas Netto and Madeira di Beneditto 2010).<br/><br/><strong><em>Eastern Atlantic<br/></em></strong>Triggerfish catch drastically declined from 18,610 tonnes in 1986 to two tonnes in 1995 in Ghanaian waters, and recent reports from CECAF capture production (FAO 2008) show that the annual catches of triggerfishes show two separate peaks between 1972 and 2003. The first peak (12,563 tons) occurred in 1979, and the second peak (17,250 tons) in 1986/87. Between 1979 and 1986/87, triggerfish catch fell to ‘regular or stable’ annual levels (5,000-8,000 tons/year). Catch sharply declined in 1988 to 2,862 tons. The continued decline indicates that inshore triggerfish catch generally increased with inshore effort (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). The triggerfish biomass was highest in 1985 and decreased afterwards up to 1991. The biomass decrease was quite significant from 1987-89 at virtually the same effort; and 1989-91 there was virtually no biomass of the triggerfish resource in Ghanaian coastal waters (Koranteng 1998, Aggrey-Fynn 2007).",Decreasing,"<em>Balistes vetula</em> is widely distributed in the Atlantic.

It is widely distributed and occurs in estuaries, but more generally over rocky reef and soft substrate in marine habitats. Historically it has been heavily exploited through most of its range, including in the southern and eastern Mediterranean Sea and along the Atlantic coast of West Africa, and is highly valued as a food fish in both domestic and international markets. Stock assessments have concluded that overfishing has been and currently is occurring in Senegal and Mauritania. Based on quantified data (commercial and small-scale fishery landings, catch per unit effort, and research survey catches)&#160;estimated declines of between 79 to 99% have been recorded in Greece, Senegal and Western Sahara. Therefore,&#160;this species' global population is suspected to have declined by an average of at least 24% over the past 30 years. Other countries with known high fishing effort, but which lack reliable quantified data, include Mauritania, Turkey and Tunisia. It is also exploited in other countries, but effort and long-term catch data are not available there (e.g., for Portugal, Israel, Malta, Ivory Coast, and Ghana).&#160;Due to the high market value of this species and the lack of effective fishery management measures, effort has been increasing on the remaining viable populations. Total landings reported to FAO have increased significantly in recent years, though this may be reflective of past non-reporting by several countries. In addition, the&#160;capture of immature individuals in most fisheries is frequent, which contributes to growth overfishing.&#160;Based on these data, we suspect that global-level declines are approaching 30% over the past three generation lengths, which is estimated as 33 years (equivalent to the time period from about 1980 to 2015).

Seasonal latitudinal migrations take place along the entire Mauritanian coast, specifically among adults (Domain 1980, Bruslé 1985). These migrations can vary interannually depending on the upwelling intensity, with intense upwelling events leading to favourable conditions for reproductive success.&#160;Cury and Worms (1982) also suggested that a seasonal migration of this species occurs from Mauritania to Senegal.

In Iskenderun Bay, Turkey, it spawns from around the beginning of June until the end of August (Gökçe <em>et al.</em> 2003 in Özgür Özbek <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;The largest fish measured in a Tunisian study was 115 cm total length, 25 kg, and estimated to be 17 years old. In the same study, females reached maturity at five to seven years and sex change occurred at 10 to 13 years (Bouain <em>et al.</em> 1983). Based on a longevity of 19 years, age of first maturity of 5 years<span style="""">, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 11 years.<br/></span></p>  <p></p>","<p>Overfishing is a major threat to this species. Fishing effort across all fisheries sectors is excessive, frequently unrecorded, and often illegal in West Africa (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, in the Eastern Mediterranean, the high economic value of <em>E. aeneus</em>, has caused an increase in fishing pressure and even the rise of illegal fishing and a black market (Ünal <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>Glamuzina and Skaramuca (1999) described&#160;<em>E. aeneus</em>&#160;as frequently occurring in North African Mediterranean waters, significantly rare in central Mediterranean areas, and absent in the northern Mediterranean Sea. Much of the population&#160;information on this species is from north-west Africa and the Mediterranean, where it has been/is highly exploited. Species-specific landings for&#160;<em>E. aeneus </em>are reported to<em>&#160;</em>FAO by some&#160;countries, and other countries also exploit this species, but only report it in mixed grouper catches. Some of the data sets present conflicting evidence which is difficult to interpret. Global FAO landings ranged between ca. 1,000 and 2,000 mt from 1965 to 2008, and increased steeply thereafter to <em>ca</em> 7,500 mt in 2014<span style="""">.&#160;</span>This may represent a genuine increase in catch, but may also reflect improved reporting in some countries, greater fishing effort or countries reporting catches made in adjacent countries (see below). For example, Sierra Leone did not report catches of this species until 2014. That first report of <em>ca </em>3,000 mt constituted 40% of the global catch.<br/><br/>Grouper species have been fished for centuries along the north-west African coast. Since the 16th century, small-scale canoe fisheries have been targeting these resources in Senegal and Mauritania. During this time period, European fishers also started fishing off the north-west African coastline (Chauveau 1989 in Thiao<em> et al</em>. 2012). At the beginning of the 20th century,&#160;<em>E. aeneus</em>&#160;was described as a target species for artisanal fishers based in Saint-Louis, which was the main fishing centre in northern Senegal. Despite the fishing effort for this species, the resource was not considered to be overexploited until the Second World War (Postel 1950 in Thiao <em>et al</em>. 2012). Following Senegal’s independence in 1960, the catch reached 3,570 mt in 1964 (Lourdelet 1996 in Thiao <em>et al.</em> 2012) and represented almost 20% of the Senegalese fish catch taken by handlines. At the end of the 20th century, the fishery underwent dramatic changes. In 1994, the development of an export market for high-quality demersal species such as groupers was enhanced by the 50% devaluation of the local currency. At present, most of these high-value species are directly exported to European and Far Eastern markets (Swartz<em> et al.</em> 2010). During this period, the development of the Senegalese small-scale fisheries was strongly supported by external aid and public subsidies, which enabled the small-scale fleet to double in size from 1985 to 2005, and it is continuing to increase (Thiao<em> et al.</em> 2012). The situation appears similar in Mauritania, where there was an eight-fold increase in the numbers of artisanal fishing boats from the 1980s to <em>ca</em> 2010 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015), which is further evidenced by the increasing trend in FAO landings (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Effort probably substantially increased further since 2010. <span style="""">Given the data presented below, this species' global population is suspected to have declined by an average of at least 24% and likely approaching 30% over the past three generation lengths, which is estimated as 33 years.</span><br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean:&#160;</strong><em>Epinephelus aeneus</em>&#160;was apparently previously a relatively abundant species in the Mediterranean Sea, but has declined significantly in many parts.<br/><br/><strong>Greece: </strong>Previously, the catches reported by Greece to FAO made it the greatest global contributor – in fact, Greece was the only country that reported catches until 1984, when Mauritania commenced reporting (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Greece began reporting in 1958, reached a peak catch of 2,100 mt in 1968, and subsequently generally declined significantly until the early 1980s. By 1984, the catch was only 593 mt and it continued a steady decline until 2011 when a zero catch was reported. Zero catch was also reported from 2012 to 2014, which represented <span style="""">a decline in the Greek catch of over 99% since 1968 (a 47 year period). Relatively lower catches of an average of 9 mt were reported in recent years by Portugal (from 1995 to 2013), Israel (from 2009 to 2014) and Malta (from 2010 to 2013). Portuguese catch peaked at 34 mt in 2005, and declined to 1 mt in 2014 (Table 1 in the Supplementary Information), but catches by Israel and Malta showed no particular trends.</span><br/><br/><strong>Italy:</strong><span style="""">&#160;A study by Bianchini&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style="""">.

In 2006, the total catch of groupers (</span><em>Epinephelus</em><span style="""">&#160;spp.) in Turkey was 481 mt, and the most common species caught was&#160;</span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style="""">. In 2006, the&#160;</span><em>E. aeneus&#160;</em><span style="""">total catch from Gökova Bay was 2,905 kg, and comprised 11% of total fish landings there. About&#160;13.3% of groupers in the Turkish fishery were immature, and 85% of those captured in Gökova Bay were immature (Ünal&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2009). The high catchability rate of this species in Cyprus and Turkey shows that trawling is a risk for populations of this species (Özgür Özbek</span><em> et al</em><span style="""">. 2013).</span><br/><br/><strong>Tunisia:</strong><span style="""">&#160;Bouain&#160;</span><em>et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">(1983) reported that&#160;</span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style="""">&#160;comprised 90% of the landings of fish at the port of Sfax.

Cote d’Ivoire reported zero catches from 1970 to 1988, followed by catches mostly between zero and 10 mt until 2009, and an increase to an average of 900 mt from 2010 to 2014. Ghana reported for relatively brief periods (from 2005 to 2009), and catch was at relatively low levels (average of 52 mt). Meissa&#160;<em style="""">et al</em>. (2013) reported that the lack of reliable stock assessments for numerous exploited fish stocks in West Africa was due to poor-quality data, high multi-specificity of captures and the heterogeneity of exploitation methods.</span><br/><br/><strong>Mauritania: </strong><span style="""">FAO landings reported by Mauritania for this species commenced in 1984, and peaked at <em>ca</em> 1,800 mt in 1988, followed by catches of around 500 mt from 1989 to 2007 (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). From 2008 onwards, catches increased significantly to <em>ca </em>1,600 mt in 2014. This increase could be ascribed to increasing effort in both the artisanal and industrial fishing sectors (Labrosse </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""> 2010 in Meissa and Gascuel 2015). In Mauritania, the probability of catching this species declined from 60% in 1995 to 10% in the late 2000s (Meissa 2008 in Thiao </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""> 2012). On the adjacent Western Saharan Bank, </span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style=""""> accounted for 5.3% of the mean total abundance of fish during research trawl surveys in 1942, but declined to only 0.001% by 1974 (&gt; 99% decline over a 33 year period); </span><em>E. aeneus</em><span style=""""> was not recorded during a fisheries research cruise there in 1990 (Balguerías </span><em>et al.</em><span style=""""> 2000).&#160;</span><em>Epinephelus aeneus</em><span style="""">&#160;is a flagship species in West Africa that is exploited by industrial and small-scale fisheries in Mauritania, and the stock is highly overexploited (Meissa&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style="""">. 2013). Subsequently, Meissa and Gascuel (2015) estimated MSY at 1,025 mt and fMSY as a very low 0.07 yr</span><sup>-1</sup><span style="""">, based on a <em>ca</em> 25 year time series of data up to 2010. Note that the FAO landings for 2014 (<em>ca</em> 1,600 mt) exceed this MSY by 56%, although it is not inconceivable that Mauritanian fishers also fish in adjacent countries, but report catches in Mauritania, as noted for Senegalese fishers.<br/><br/><strong style="""">Senegal:</strong> Of the countries in north-west Africa, Senegal reports the highest landings for this species to FAO. Senegal began to report catches to FAO in 2003, when it recorded a catch of 685 mt (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Information). Catch increased steadily to 2,142 mt in 2014, and the annual average catch from 2003 to 2014 was 1,383 mt. Although these relatively recent catch data could be indicative of a developing fishery, other longer-term indicators (see below) indicate that this species has long been overfished in Senegalese waters. For example, the Senegalese small-scale fishery landed 3,570 mt in 1964 (Lourdelet 1996 in Thiao <em style="""">et al</em>. 2012) and total catch of&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;across small-scale and industrial fisheries was 1,851 mt in 1991 (Gascuel and Ménar 1997). Overall Senegalese landings of this species reported by Ndiaye <em style="""">et al</em>. (2013) were ca. 2,200 mt in 1981, peaked at ca. 4,900 mt in 1983 and declined to ca. 850 mt in 2008, which constitutes a 79% decline over a 26 year period. As reported earlier, FAO landings contrast with these data (see Supplementary Material). Contributing to this discrepancy may be Senegalese fishers buying licenses to fish&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Guinea and Sierra Leone where the stock is more abundant&#160;(Thiao <em style="""">et al</em>. 2012), but presumably reporting their catches in Senegal, thereby reflecting an apparent increase in FAO landings for Senegal. Catch data collected from three artisanal fishing sites in northern Senegal also recorded a precipitous decline of about 95% from a peak of ca. 1,300 mt in 1975 to 64 mt in 2006&#160;(i.e., over a 32 year period) (Thiao <em style="""">et al</em>. 2012). The catch per unit effort (CPUE; kg/trip) also declined by 95% over this period. CPUE in research trawls also declined by about 20% from 1987 to 2004 (an 18 year period).&#160;FAO working groups (FAO 2006, 2012 in Thiao <em style="""">et al.</em> 2012) recommended a moratorium on catches of&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Senegal and Mauritania due to the expected extirpation of the species otherwise. Gascuel and Ménar (1997) classified&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;in Senegal as an overexploited species based on&#160;fishing effort in 1991, this being 2.7 times greater than the fMSY and MSY was estimated as ca. 3,000 mt a year, which was exceeded by the artisanal fishery alone between 1984 and 1986 (Gascuel and Ménar 1997). As a result, catch declined and reached a low at 1,135 mt in 1998 (Martial&#160;<em style="""">et al</em>. 2002). A range of stock assessment approaches showed a decline in biomass in Senegal of 80 to 90% from 1971 to 1999 (over 29 years) due to excessive fishing effort (Laurens&#160;<em style="""">et al</em>. 2002, 2003). According to Froese (2004), the Senegalese stock of<em style="""">&#160;E. aeneus</em>&#160;was overfished based on a decline in the percentage of mature&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em>&#160;individuals in the catch from about 80% in the early 1990s to about 38% in 1999. During the same period, percentages of&#160;<em style="""">E.&#160; aeneus</em>&#160;individuals at optimal length and of ‘mega-spawners’ (i.e. fish &gt;100 cm TL) had decreased from about 35% to less than 20%. Ndiaye <em style="""">et al.</em> (2013) repeated the approach of Froese <em style="""">et al. </em>(2004) and reiterated that the stock was overexploited; however, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the age and growth parameters used to determine optimal length. A 40% decline of the mean length of individuals in the catch has also occurred: from 68 cm in 1974 to 42 cm in 2010. The optimal length of capture to maintain fishery sustainability was 96 cm, but only 0.03% of captured individuals&#160;were of this length, and most of the catch consisted of juveniles. Thiao<em style=""""> et al</em>. (2012) suggested that the collapse of the&#160;<em style="""">E. aeneus</em> fishery in Senegal is linked to the booming small-scale fishery sector benefiting from increasing foreign demand in a globalised market, and a favourable economic context for fishers who benefit from public subsidies to purchase fishing gear, etc.</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species&#160;is distributed in the southern and eastern waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the southern Atlantic coasts of Portugal and Spain, and southwards along the Atlantic coast of West Africa as far as southern Angola, including the islands of the Gulf of Guinea. It has been considered to be absent north of 44°N in the Adriatic Sea before 1992&#160;(Dulcic <em>et al.</em> 2006, Dulcic and Grbec 2000), but Glamuzina<em> et al</em>. (2000) suggested that&#160;this species&#160;was more recently beginning to colonize new areas in the northern Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. It was also considered to be absent from Spain to central Italy in the central Mediterranean, but two specimens were caught in July 2012 off Corsica, France <span style="""">(Ruit</span>ort 2012), and a third specimen was captured in January 2014 off Monaco (P. Gilles and P. Francour pers. comm. 2016). Records from the Canary Islands, Spain are unsubstantiated (Heemstra and Randall 1993), as are also those for Madeira (P. Francour pers. comm. 2016). Its depth range is 20 to 200 metres.</p>","<p>This species is highly esteemed and economically valued as a food fish throughout its range, and is typically caught with hook-and-line and in trawls (Maigret and Ly 1986, Heemstra and Randall 1993). In Senegal, it is mainly exploited by artisanal fishers, but also by localised industrial scale fisheries for export (Cury and Worms 1982). This is also an important species in European markets, with most of the marketed catch likely<strong>&#160;</strong>imported from elsewhere, such as Senegal. It is also valued in Turkey (Ünal <em>et al.</em> 2009). Illegal spear-fishing for this species is also reported in the eastern Mediterranean by professional divers using lights at night (Ünal <em>et al</em>. 2009, Özgür Özbek <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>",Marine,"<p>In north-west Africa, attempts to reduce fishing pressure on this species by implementing seasonal closures and marine protected areas have been ineffective due to a lack of enforcement (Thiao<em> et al</em>. 2012). It is critical to address and mitigate pressure from small-scale fisheries in west Africa, especially Mauritania and Senegal, to prevent further declines (Thiao<em> et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Turkey, prior to 2016, the legal size of groupers (<em>Epinephelus aeneus</em> included) was 30 cm, longline grouper fishing using hooks smaller than No. 9 was prohibited between 15th June and 31st July, and targeting groupers with longline hooks smaller than No. 14, spearguns, fish traps and fyke nets was strictly prohibited. The recent 2016-2020 Amateur and Commercial Fisheries Circular adopted a prohibition on fishing, collecting, transferring and selling&#160;<em>E. aeneus </em>and also&#160;<em>E. marginatus</em>&#160;in Turkey.<br/><br/>In Tunisia, all grouper individuals below 35 cm standard length must be released and spearfishing for&#160;groupers is totally prohibited (Journal officiel de la République Tunisienne 1994, 1995). However, these prohibitions are generally ineffective due to insufficient enforcement (E. Ben Lamine pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>This species has been reported from three small marine protected areas in Spain (Planes <em>et al</em>. 2006). Attempts to grow this species in aquaculture are complicated by problems in broodstock management and larval culture (Gorshkova <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, some positive results for aquaculture of&#160;<em>E. aeneus</em>&#160;have been achieved in Israel (Hassin <em>et al</em>. 1997, Cnaani <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>","",,false,false,Global

Its highest natural abundance occurs in KwaZulu Natal Province, and spawning only occurs north of Durban (KwaZulu-Natal to southern Mozambique), which constitutes less than half of its full range. It is generally a minor component of reef fish fisheries throughout its range, but can comprise up to 60% of the aggregated grouper landings in the commercial skiboat fishery of KwaZulu-Natal. Catch per unit effort in the KwaZulu-Natal shore-based recreational fishery declined by 67% over approximately 34 years (1975-2009), and may have declined in the boat-based recreational and commercial skiboat fishery by 38 to 50% over an approximately 15-year interval (1994-1996 to 2008-2009). Catch per unit effort in the southern&#160;Mozambique semi-industrial linefishery declined by 75% over approximately five years (2009-2014). Its aggregating behaviour during spawning season can cause this species to be particularly susceptible to high fishing pressure. Therefore, it is suspected that global-level population declines of nearly 30% have occurred over the past three generation lengths (22.5 years; 1993-2016). There have been some conservation measures implemented to reduce fishing effort, including bag and size limits and a limit on numbers of commercial fishing licenses in South Africa; however, compliance with some regulations has been in decline. There are also at least two large, relatively well-managed marine protected areas in KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique that provide some protection to the population in offshore areas of the protected areas (i.e., beyond the reach of subsistence shorefishers). However, it is unlikely that fishing effort has been reduced over the entire range of this species to allow recovery.&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">This species is listed as Near Threatened since it nearly meets the threshold for Vulnerable A2bd. Further research should be directed to refine life history parameters and compile population data such as catch, effort and biomass. Conservation measures that reduce fishing effort and improve enforcement are imperative to prevent further population decline.</span></p>","<p>This species is closely associated with shallow rocky reefs, and is rarely recorded on coral reefs (Chater <em>et al</em>. 1993, Chater <em>et al</em>. 1995). Adults undertake pioneering behaviour or small migrations, likely in search of available habitat that has been vacated by other predatory fishes and adults of this species are often among the first species to arrive on newly-created artificial reefs or shipwrecks (Maggs 2012, S. Chater pers. comm. 2016). Juveniles migrate from nursery habitat on surf-zone reefs to deeper offshore reef habitats with increasing size and age (Mann<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015). Results from tagging studies indicates the species exhibits a high degree of site fidelity, and generally do not undergo substantial migrations as adults, although some pre-adults undertake movements greater than 400 km (Maggs 2012, Maggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b, Mann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Mann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a, Mann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b); of 2,320 individuals tagged in South Africa in 30 years, 22% have been recaptured, and moved an average distance of 5 km (Oceanographic Research Institute unpublished data). There is likely northward movement of pre-adults from southern to northern KwaZulu-Natal, as no spawning occurs south of Durban; although considerable numbers of reproductively inactive fish are caught there (Mann<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015). Spawning only occurs north of 30°, and not all mature individuals spawn every year (Fennessy 2000). There is some evidence for spawning-related localised increases in abundance (i.e., aggregations) during summer (January to March, and large catches have been recorded (S. Fennessy unpublished data). The species is a relatively slow-growing, diandric protogynous hermaphrodite (i.e., some males are derived from functional females, but some develop from the juvenile phase), so the sex ratio is not female-biased as in monandric protogynous hermaphrodites. Size and age at first maturity are slightly greater for females (49 cm, 3.9 years) and males (43 cm, 2.7 years) and it has been aged to at least 11 years (Fennessy 2000, Fennessy and Sadovy 2002).

Longevity may be longer than is currently understood. Its maximum length is 90 cm.</p>","<p>Overfishing is a major threat to this species over most of its range (excluding the offshore portions of marine protected areas in KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique). In addition, a species distribution modelling study by Coppinger (2013) that applied sea surface temperature projections under climate change forecasts predicted a 16% decline in habitable waters for this species by 2030&#160;due to a contraction in the northern part of its range due to higher temperatures, and in the south due to lower temperatures.</p>","<p>This species is relatively common in South Africa, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal province. It is relatively abundant only between Folokwe in Eastern Cape Province north to Quissico Province (32°15'S and 24°50'S). A genetics study reported some evidence for subpopulations, albeit with conflicting findings from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Coppinger 2013), but for the purposes of this assessment, it is considered to be comprised of a single population across South Africa and Mozambique. Based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) data, this species is suspected to have declined by nearly 30% over the past three generation lengths (22.5 years; 1993-2016).<strong><br/><br/>South Africa:&#160;</strong>According to observations during underwater surveys conducted on deeper (~15 m) coral reefs in the iSimangaliso marine protected area (MPA), this species is not common (Floros 2010). It was the sixth most commonly caught species (~5% of total catch by number) in research shore angling catches in iSimangaliso from 2001 to 2013 (Mann 2016).&#160;This species comprises a relatively low portion (~3% by weight) of the offshore skiboat fishery catch in South Africa (Dunlop 2011). It also only contributed about 1% to spearfishing catches in the mid-1990s (Mann <em>et al.</em> 1997a) and more recently contributes about 0.3% to recreational shorefishing catches (Dunlop 2011). Catch per unit effort of this species in the KwaZulu-Natal recreational boat fishery declined by 50% over a 15 year interval from 0.54 in 1994-1996 to 0.27 fish per boat day in 2008-2009, and by 38% in the commercial sector of this fishery from 3.23 to 2.01 fish per boat day during the same time period (Mann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997b, Dunlop 2011); however, these declines are not based on a continuous time series<span style="""">&#160;(i.e., it is based on two individual snapshot surveys).&#160;</span>Though this species is a relatively minor component of shore catches, catch per unit effort in the Kwa-Zulu Natal shore-based recreational fishery declined by 67% over about 34 years from 0.003 fish/angler/day in 1975-1977 (Joubert 1981) to 0.001 in 2008-2009 (Dunlop 2011, Dunlop and Mann 2012, Dunlop and Mann 2013). The only continuous South African long-term catch&#160;data available is from mostly unverified compulsory commercial catch records from KwaZulu-Natal submitted by skippers to the national fisheries department. This species comprises about 60% of the aggregated grouper landings in the KwaZulu-Natal commercial skiboat fishery, and from 1987 to 2013, catch declined by 53% from 1993 to 2013 (from about 75 to 35 tons). However, fishing effort was reduced by about 50% in 2003 due to a reduction in numbers of commercial fishing licenses. Standardized catch per unit effort for aggregated grouper catches from 1987 to 2013 remained stable at about 8 kg/boat/day (H. Winker unpub. data 2016<span style="""">).</span>&#160;In contrast, the co-occurring seabreams (Sparidae), which are the main target of this fishery (~80% of catch weight versus 5% for groupers), have shown an increase in catch per unit effort after the 2003 effort reduction. There is some conflict between the information from the two independent snapshot surveys (1994-1996 and 2008-2009), which suggest declines over this period, versus that from the continuous information submitted by the commercial fishery, which suggests stability (albeit for aggregated grouper landings). Based on spawner biomass per recruit analyses of data from the mid 1990s for this species, the exploitation rate was assessed as optimal (~40% of pristine spawning biomass per recruit; Fennessy 2000), but this assessment is considerably outdated.<strong><br/><br/>Mozambique:</strong> This species was not commonly observed during underwater surveys in the Ponta do Ouro marine protected area in southern Mozambique (Pereira and Fernandes 2014). It comprised less than 1% by number and less than 2% by weight of the overall catches of the southern Mozambique semi-industrial linefishery from 2002 to 2014. Catch per unit effort in this fishery declined by 75%&#160;from about 6 kg/boat/day in 2009 to 1.5 in 2014 (R. Mutombene unpub. data 2016), although this trend may be distorted by changes in fleet spatial fishing effort. Similarly, the relative contribution of this species to overall catch appears to have declined since the mid-1990s when the fishery underwent rapid development, although there is some uncertainty about the relative contribution of groupers prior to 2002 due to sampling biases. Fleet dynamics could also affect the apparent contribution, as groupers are not the main target of the fishery.</p>",Decreasing,"This species is distributed from eastern South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces to 34°05'S) northwards to Quissico in southern Mozambique (24°50'S). It has recently been recorded further south in the De Hoop marine protected area (34°30’S, 20°40’E) in Western Cape, South Africa (C. Attwood pers. comm. 2016). Reports of this species occurring in Madagascar are dubious (McKenna and Allen 2003), and recent work suggests it is either rare or absent there (S. Fennessy unpublished data 2016). Its depth range is zero to 100 metres, but typically occurs shallower than 70 metres.<br/><br/>The area within the generalized distribution polygon clipped to the zero to 100 metre isobath, which is the best estimate of area of occupancy (AOO),&#160;is 27,310 km². This species is closely reef-associated, and this is therefore an overestimation of its AOO, but no spatial data are available to calculate a total area of rocky reef habitat in this region. The area within the minimum convex polygon drawn around the boundaries  of its AOO, which is the best estimate of extent of occurrence (EOO), is  248,463 km².","Apart from the offshore portions of the protected areas, this species is caught in local artisanal and small-scale commercial fisheries&#160;throughout its range.",Marine,"<p>This species occurs in several large, well-enforced marine protected areas in South Africa (e.g., the iSimangaliso World Heritage Site in northern&#160;KwaZulu-Natal), and in the adjacent Ponta do Ouro marine protected area (MPA) of southern Mozambique. The total area of these MPAs is ~1,400 km², although much of this extends beyond the depth range of this species; subsistence shore fishing (subject to recreational size and bag limits) occurs in these MPAs in South Africa. Additional MPAs in the range of this species in South Africa are to be promulgated shortly (as of 2018). Previously, there was fairly good compliance with bag and size limitation&#160;regulations owing to an active conservation agency in KwaZulu-Natal; however, as of July 2016, adherence to compliance measures has been considerably reduced with the removal of the agency’s mandate by the national department of fisheries. Mann (2016)&#160;found a larger mean size of individuals of this species&#160;in a previously exploited area compared to a no-take sanctuary area in the South African iSimangaliso MPA, and Maggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013a) found a greater abundance of this species in the adjacent exploited area compared to the no-take zone of the Pondoland MPA some 400 km to the south. This is suspected to be attributable to this species' pioneering behaviour. In South Africa, fishing regulations that apply to this species include a minimum size limit of 50 cm total length and a recreational and commercial bag limit of five fish per person per day.&#160;Commercial fishing effort in the South African skiboat fishery&#160;was substantially reduced in 2003 upon the withdrawal of <em>ca</em> 50% of fishing permits.&#160;A general recreational bag limit of four serranid fish applies in Mozambique, but is seldom enforced. In summary, about 30% of its Mozambican range (using coastline length) falls into a reasonably well-managed MPA (only pelagic fishing allowed) in southern Mozambique. In South Africa, around 30% of the range of reproductively active individuals is relatively well-protected in an MPA (adjacent to the southern Mozambique MPA). An additional large MPA occurs well to the south providing further protection for non-reproductively active individuals, but there is evidence that some individuals move from this MPA to join the reproductively active part of the population in the north. None of the MPAs provide full protection as they all have some subsistence fishing from the shore. The MPA in southern Mozambique and the adjacent one in northern South Africa are not ideal habitat for this species - the reefs there are mainly coral and this is not a coral reef species - but still offer some protection, at least from boat-based fishing (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2017).</p>","",,false,false,Global
100465433,61337,Epinephelus daemelii,Near Threatened,,2018,2016-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em style=""font-style: italic;"">Epinephelus daemelii</em> is a large grouper species that inhabits nearshore rocky reef habitat. Its range is relatively small, extending mainly only from New South Wales in Australia, northern New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands. It is a very high quality eating fish, and its territorial and inquisitive nature causes it to be easily captured by recreational (spear and line)&#160;and commercial line-fishers. In addition, intrinsic biological characteristics cause it to be highly susceptible to rapid population decline. As a result of heavy fishing pressure throughout much of its range in the past, its populations, and most probably also fish size,&#160;declined severely throughout the greater part of its distribution since early in the 20th century. Anecdotal evidence from the 1950s through the 1970s also documented that overfishing by recreational line-fishers and spear-fishers had continued, as large specimens were by then considered to be rare in New South Wales.&#160;However, current population trends are difficult to determine from the data currently available, as there are no catch records available for it. A fishing ban that is relatively well-enforced has been in place throughout its range except for southern Queensland for at least the past 30 years (since the 1980s).&#160;It has, however, shown no signs of any population recovery since it has been protected. Its abundance still remains very low, except in a few very remote regions and in some isolated no-take marine protected areas.&#160;Given that its population is suspected to have remained at a very low level following very severe historical declines, and protective measures have not yet allowed for population recovery to occur, this species is listed as Near Threatened based on is high dependence on ongoing conservation actions being in place, particularly as it is considered that the removal of any of the existing conservation measures would quickly cause this species to qualify for a threatened category under criterion A (A3 or A4) within 10 years. In addition to population monitoring and the continuance of fishing bans, it is recommended that research on life history parameters and reproductive biology is conducted.<span style=""""><br/></span>","This species<strong>&#160;</strong>inhabits nearshore caves, ledges and rocky reefs to depths of over 50 metres. Sub-adults have been observed in estuaries (Hutchins and Swainston 1986, Harasti <em>et al. </em>2004), and recently settled juveniles are found in coastal rock pools along the southern New South Wales coastline (Hutchins and Swainston 1986, Griffiths 2003, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species exhibits aggressive territorial behavior: each adult individual generally has its own cave or 'hole' that it occupies for life (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2004). It has been observed sharing its cave with several other reef fishes, including the Red Moki in New Zealand (Doak 1978). High habitat complexity may be important to this species, as it may prefer a wide variety of structure that provides refuge and a suitable habitat in which to seek and ambush prey. Larger individuals generally occur further offshore and smaller fish appear to prefer shallower waters around inshore reefs and islands (Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species is most active at dusk and during the night (Kuiter 1993). Adults prey mainly on fishes and crustaceans (McCulloch 1922 cited in Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2004) and juveniles generally feed on smaller crabs and smaller fish species (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Spawning aggregations have not been observed in the North Island, New Zealand (Stewart 1999). Observations of small aggregations of up to twelve fish in New South Wales,&#160;could suggest it gathers at particular times of the year; however, it is not known whether these aggregations are for spawning purposes or not (Harasti&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Very little research has been conducted on its reproductive biology in Australian waters (Harasti<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004).The average age at first maturity is probably less than 20 years for females and more than 30 years for males and longevity is possibly up to 65 years, however, uncertainty in the data indicates that further investigation is needed (Francis <em>et al. </em>2015). This species has a maximum total length of 180 cm and weight of over 80 kg. Sizes in New Zealand are typically between 40 and 80 cm and reports of individuals up to 200 cm in length (e.g., Paulin and Roberts 1992) have been revised downward through work by Francis<em>&#160;et al</em>. (2015). This species initially grows rather rapidly, to ~75 cm total length in the first&#160;10 years, then growth slows &#160;~100 cm total length around 20 years of age and past 30 years, it may grow relatively little (Francis <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Further research is needed to confirm if this species is&#160;a protogynous hermaphrodite, and life history data remains highly uncertain<span style="""">&#160;(M. Craig pers. comm. 2017)</span>.",Overfishing was a major threat to this species in the past. It suffers mortality when captured as bycatch by commercial fishers in deeper (~50 to 100 m) waters off northern New South Wales due to severe barotrauma stress (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002). Degradation of estuarine nursery habitats may impact juvenile survivability (Fishnote 2002).,"Historically this species was targeted by recreational and commercial fishers, and experienced significant population declines (possibly greater than 90%) as a result. It has been largely protected from fishing since the early 1980s, but the lack of quantitative data prevents an understanding of population trends. Intrinsic biological characteristics&#160;(e.g., extended longevity, <span style="""">presumed&#160;</span>late age at maturity, <span style="""">suspected&#160;</span>protogynous hermaphroditism, etc.), together with the territoriality of this large and once highly sought after grouper species, causes it to be highly susceptible to rapid population decline due to fishing pressure. Despite fishing bans in place since the 1980s, its abundance still remains low with no indications of recovery, except in very remote regions and in some no-take marine protected areas (Francis <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is possibly still declining in some areas (e.g., at Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs), and certainly does not appear to be increasing from its long-term depleted and ongoing low baseline condition which prevails in most areas of its distribution. Population increases may be possible given a longer time period for recovery from fishing, especially if a fishing ban is enforced in remaining unprotected areas of its range.<span style=""""><br/></span><strong><br/></strong><strong>Australia:</strong> In Australia, this species is mainly found along the entire New South Wales coast and is most common (especially as adults) in waters off northern New South Wales. It is considered to be naturally uncommon in southern Queensland (Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2004). There is a single population in New South Wales: eggs and larvae of this species are transported southwards via the East Australian Current, and early stage juveniles recruit to intertidal rock pools mainly in the southern part of the state. Sub-adults and/or small adults later presumably migrate northwards to spawn in the northern half of the state, where the larger male fish (&gt;110 cm total length) occur (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2004, Francis<em> et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Juvenile specimens are also commonly found along the southern coastline of New South Wales in eastern Australia, and also around Lord Howe, Norfolk and the Kermadec Islands (Paulin and Roberts 1992). Roughley (1916) reported that&#160;<em>E. daemelii</em>&#160;was ""at one time ... fairly plentiful in the vicinity of Port Jackson"", but that it had already become very scarce due to fishing pressure there by the early 1900s; and McCulloch (1922) reported it was once quite common in New South Wales but had become very scarce in “recent years” (i.e., presumably prior to the early 1920s). It then continued to be depleted well into the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup>&#160;century due to commercial and recreational fishing pressures. Historical evidence (pre-1908) also indicated that a decline in abundance and possibly size had already occurred in New South Wales by around the turn of the 20th century, especially near large towns or cities. Anecdotal evidence from in various fishing and diving magazines published in the 1960s and 1970s documented that overfishing by New South Wales recreational line fishers and spear-fishers had occurred, as large specimens were then considered to be rare and a prized catch. Individuals captured during spearfishing competitions in New South Wales in 1976 averaged a weight of only 2.4 kg (Lincoln-Smith <em>et al. </em>1989), though this species can grow to over 80 kg. It has been protected in Australia since 1983.&#160;A formal population monitoring program has been in place since about 2012 (about five years) in northern New South Wales that includes regular underwater visual censuses conducted by NSW Fisheries staff (Harasti and Malcolm 2013). Given the short time period that this program has been in place, measurable changes in this species’ population are not yet know; however, initial evidence indicates that both the size and abundance of this species are greater in the more northerly parts of its New South Wales range (Francis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><strong><br/>New Zealand/Tasman Sea:</strong>&#160;This species is <span style="""">common </span>in the northern Tasman Sea, including the Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands and Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (Leadbitter 1992, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oxley <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pratchett <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is also <span style="""">common </span>in the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand, and also<span style=""""> relatively common i</span>n the Three Kings Islands, but generally naturally rare in North Island, New Zealand (Paulin and Roberts 1992, Francis 1993, Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2004). Fish in northern New Zealand may have their origins in source populations originating from Lord Howe, Norfolk or the Kermadec Islands, and thus, North Island probably represents a population sink (Francis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Small juveniles (down to about 5 cm) have been observed in tidepools in the Kermadec Islands, indicating that there could possibly be some self recruitment there (T. Trnski pers. comm. 2016).&#160;Underwater surveys conducted at Elizabeth Reef recorded the abundance of this species as four fish per hectare, with no significant change in abundance between surveys in 1987 and 2003; although mean size of fish increased slightly over this ~15 year period (maximum size in 2003 was 150 cm), possibly due to its full protection enforced since the late 1980s (Oxley <em>et al</em>. 2004). Surveys conducted in the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs in 2006 and 2011 recorded the average abundance of this species as 2.31 fish per hectare, and between the surveys, abundance declined significantly at four out of the eight sites surveyed, but the cause of the decline is not fully understood (Pratchett <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Unknown,"This species is distributed in warm temperate and subtropical waters of the south-western Pacific Ocean, mainly between ~ 28 to 35°S. It occurs in Australia from far southern Queensland (Flinders and Saumarez reefs) to just across the New South Wales-Victorian border (Harasti<em> et al. </em>2004).&#160;A specimen from Kangaroo Island, South Australia is suspected to be a misidentification or represent another species of <em>Epinephelus </em>(Gomon <em>et al</em>. 2008). It also occurs in the Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands, around the Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs (offshore reefs north of Lord Howe Island), in the northern Tasman Sea and the more northerly parts of North Island, New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands&#160;(Paulin and Roberts 1992, Oxley<em> et al.</em> 2004, Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2004). Juvenile specimens have been collected as far south as Hawkes Bay (near Napier) in New Zealand and also occasionally range as far south as Cook Strait (one has been recorded off Westland on the South Island), but they are rare south of East Cape in New Zealand. This species occurs from zero to about 50 metres depth, but at least one record has been taken at a depth of over 100 metres.","<p>Previously this species was heavily targeted by both recreational and commercial fisheries; however, a fishing ban for this species has been in place throughout its range for at least the past 30 years. There may be some unknown level of illegal fishing and unintentional bycatch during both commercial and recreational fishing activities (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002). Non-consumptive use includes its high value for ecotourism, especially to recreational diver underwater photography enthusiasts.</p>",Marine,"This species remains unprotected from fishing in southern Queensland, but is mostly not currently targeted elsewhere in its range due to fishing bans specifically for this species. Take of this species has been prohibited (considered 'totally protected') in New South Wales since 1983. It has also been listed as a Vulnerable Species under the New South Wales Fisheries Management Act since 1999, and its take by fishing operations other than by scientific permit has been illegal since 1991. A recovery plan was prepared for this species by New South Wales Fisheries (NSW Department of Primary Industries) in 2012, with the main emphasis of this plan concentrated on further research and population monitoring.&#160;A monitoring program is currently in place in northern New South Wales that includes regular underwater visual censuses conducted by NSW Fisheries staff (Harasti and Malcolm 2013). As this monitoring program has only been in place for a short period of time, no evidence has been obtained of any measurable changes in this species’ population status. These surveys have, however, shown that both the size and abundance of this species are greater in the more northerly parts of its range along the New South Wales coastline (see Francis<em> et al</em>. 2015). It is also a Totally Protected Species in New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands&#160;under the New Zealand Wildlife Act 1953.&#160;It also occurs in several marine reserves and protected areas throughout its range&#160;(Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;Enforcement of the fishing ban&#160;and no-take zones within protected areas is considered relatively effective since they are generally well-managed and policed. In some, however, such as those at Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs, this may not be the case. Outside strict fishing no-take (sanctuary) zones, which generally make up only a small proportion of many of these protected areaa, and in those areas of such reserves where some fishing is allowed, any black cod that may be caught incidentally as by-catch from deeper waters (i.e., those &gt;25 m) probably do not survive capture due to barotrauma, even if the fish may have been released.","",,false,false,Global

Data are very limited on its population, fisheries catch statistics and life history. It is taken by fisheries throughout its range and is a highly regarded food fish. Species-specific catch statistics available from Sierra Leone indicate a decline in annual landings over the past 18 years of 69% (1999-2017). Relatively higher catches, however, were reported from Senegal in recent years (2012-2015), though only three years of data are available. Considering that fishing pressure is known to be high and driving declines in grouper populations in most other West African countries (e.g., for&#160;<em>Epinephelus aeneus</em>), it is suspected that this latter species has experienced declines of nearly 30% over the past three generation lengths (about 30 years, or since the 1980s) due to continuing overfishing, and this species is listed as Near Threatened because it nearly meets the thresholds for criterion A2bd. Further research on <em>E. goreensis</em> is therefore strongly recommended to resolve data gaps in its life history and reproductive biology as well as harvest trends and population status. Improved fisheries monitoring and management is also needed.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","<p>This species inhabits a variety of demersal habitats including rock, mud and sand. Adults reside in relatively deeper waters than immature individuals (Maigret and Ly 1986). It primarily consumes fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (da Silva Monteiro 1998). Its maximum total length is 140 cm, but more commonly to 50 cm in fisheries catches. Its reproductive biology and life history are poorly known, but its longevity may be about 15 years or more considering what is known on other grouper species of similar size.

Despite the likelihood that this species is taken at some level in fisheries throughout its range, the only species-specific catch statistics reported to the FAO global fisheries database are from Sierra Leone, and more recently from Senegal. Potentially, this is due to catches of this species being reported by most countries as part of a more ""mixed-species"" grouper catches. Fishing pressures in most countries within its range, however, would probably be generally similar to that in Sierra Leone; therefore, declines on a global-level are suspected to be similar to those observed in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>Reports of catches of Dungat Grouper from Sierra Leone to FAO began in 1994 at 120 tonnes, increased to a peak of 290 t in 1999, and declined thereafter to 89 t in 2015 (FAO FishStatJ 2017; see Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). This represents a catch decline of 69% over a 16 year period, with some uncertainty associated with catches reported over the past 8 years. Catches of this species have only been reported to FAO by Senegal in recent years (289 t in 2012, 277 t in 2014 and 394 t in 2015), and these are comparably similar to catch levels in Sierra Leone during the peak of catch there which occurred in 1999 at 290 t (FAO FishStatJ 2017; see Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).&#160;<em>Epinephelus aeneus</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, which&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">is a generally similar-sized species caught by the same methods over roughly the same depths and throughout a similar geographical range from Mauritania southwards,</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;is a flagship species in West Africa that is exploited by industrial and small-scale fisheries, and the stock is highly overexploited (Froese 2004, Meissa&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2013).&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">A range of stock assessment approaches showed a decline in biomass in Senegal of 80 to 90% from 1971 to 1999 (over 29 years) due to excessive fishing effort (Laurens&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2002, 2003).&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Overall Senegalese landings of&#160;</span><em>E. aeneus&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">declined from ca. 4,900 mt in 1983 to ca. 850 mt in 2008, which constitutes a 79% decline over a 26 year period (</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Ndiaye&#160;</span><em>et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2013)</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">.

It is highly valued by both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, and is particularly susceptible to overexploitation due to its slow-growth, likelihood to form spawning aggregations and large body size. Catch data indicate that this species declined by 69% and 80% over recent 8 and 15 year periods in the two separate jurisdictions in which it is fished. Due to increasing fishing effort in deep waters, these declines are expected to continue in to the future. There are several fishery regulations implemented by New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland state fisheries authorities, but enforcement in the offshore grounds where these fisheries operate is not considered sufficient. In addition, uncertainty surrounding key data on life history parameters and catch and effort has prevented the development of a sustainable fishery management plan. Therefore, this species is suspected to have undergone global-level declines approaching 30% over most of the past generation length, which is estimated to be about 23 years, and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next two generation lengths. It is listed as Near Threatened since it nearly meets the thresholds for Vulnerable A4bd.

This species&#160;is a protogynous hermaphrodite, and females mature between 70 and 80 cm in length and 6 to 8 kg in weight (Rowling 1994). It may form spawning aggregations in deep water, but this requires further study (Pogonoski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013). The longevity and age at maturity of this species are poorly understood due to the lack of studies conducted on offshore species such as this, but the oldest aged individual to date was 28 years&#160;(Sumpton <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, its actual longevity is likely to be greater than this (M. Craig and D. Pollard pers. comm. 2018). According to Wakefield <em>et al</em>. (2015), <em>Hyporthodus octofasciatus</em>, which is similar to this species, has an estimated longevity of 47-56 years off Western Australia and an age at first sexual maturity of 6 years. Based on these data and general&#160;knowledge of deep-water grouper life history, we suspect an age at first maturity of around 6 years and a longevity of about 40 years for <em>H. ergastularius</em>, and&#160;one generation length is therefore estimated to be around 23 years (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2018).","This species is susceptible to overexploitation, especially considering its intrinsic biological and life history characteristics that include the probable formation of spawning aggregations, large body size, late maturity onset and long-life span (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The majority of the global population of this species is concentrated over only about 1,000 km of the south-eastern Australian coastline. The stock of this species is currently managed across two separate jurisdictions, and it is not known if this stock may represent genetically separate populations (Sumpton<em> et al</em>. 2013). Up to around 2000, about 95% of the overall catch of this species was taken by the New South Wales deepwater dropline fishery where it is the dominant species in that fishery (Yearsley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). The species began to be targeted more intensively from around 1990, and for the first decade (1990-2000) catches in the dropline fishery fluctuated between 12 and 28 metric tonnes per year, before attaining a peak of around 34 mt between 2001 and 2003. Annual catches then declined rapidly over the following four years to a low of around 8 mt by 2006-2007, and have remained at an average of only about 10.5 mt over the eight year period since then and up to 2014. This represents an estimated decline of 69% over the 15 years up to 2014. The species is considered to be very susceptible to hook and line fishing, and ""reasonable"" catch rates were only maintained by fishing previously unexploited grounds or grounds which had been “rested” from fishing for some time, which possibly explains the fluctuations in catches prior to 2001-2003 (Rowling 1996). In addition, the New South Wales stock may experience fluctuations in recruitment strength from year to year (Rowling 1995) and the high proportion of immature individuals in the overall catch of this species is cause for concern (Rowling 1996).&#160;For example, female sexual maturity is estimated to occur at lengths of between 70-80 cm, but the majority of the landed individuals were between only 40-70 cm in length, with most of the smallest individuals likely being taken as trap and trawl by-catch&#160;(Rowling 1994). Recreational catches in New South Wales were estimated to have totalled less than ~10 mt in the past, though catch and effort may be increasing.&#160;<br/><br/>This species is also the main target of&#160;the southern Queensland deepwater linefishery, where it is considered to be the species “most at risk of overexploitation”&#160;(Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Concerns about the sustainability of Queensland’s deepwater&#160;fisheries have been highlighted for many years&#160;and both commercial and recreational fishery sectors are believed to have increased&#160;fishing effort in deeper water.&#160;From 1992-1999, annual landings in the Queensland deepwater line fishery ranged from 0 mt to about 16 mt (Pogonoski<em> et al</em>. 2002, Sumpton and Ryan 2004), continued to fluctuate between 2 and 15 mt up to 2007, peaked at about 50 mt in 2008 and then rapidly and continuously declined to about 10 mt by 2011 (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013), and this decline may likely be continuing to the present day. This represents a decline of about 80% over the 8 years up to 2011. Catch per unit effort appears to follow the same trends as the catch, although much uncertainty is associated with the reporting of these data, and there is evidence that spawning aggregations may be or have been targeted at least in the southern Queensland fishery. This species is known to be significantly under-reported in commercial logbooks (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Overall, this species is therefore estimated to have undergone 69% and 80% declines over recent 8 and 15 years periods in New South Wales and Queensland, respectively, due to overexploitation.&#160;Since effort is known to be increasing, it is likely that this decline will continue into the future. Considering the uncertainty in the data, it is suspected that this species has declined globally by nearly 30% or more over&#160;most of the past generation length, which is estimated to be about 23 years, and without significant improvements to fisheries management&#160;this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next two generation lengths.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southeastern Australia from Lady Musgrave Island, southern Queensland, south to Eden, southern New South Wales (OZCAM database accessed February 2018). There are outlying records to the south from Bass Strait off Victoria and to the north from Dunk Island off northern Queensland (though see taxonomic notes re <em>H. octofasciatus </em>for further comments on the unlikelihood of its presence in the latter area). Specimens reported from the Lord Howe and Norfolk Ridges in the Tasman Sea (Bray 2018) are also more likely to be <em>H. octofasciatus</em>.&#160;Reports of two large specimens from a fish market in Western Samoa require verification, but are also likely to be misidentifications of <em>Hyporthodus octofasciatus</em>&#160;(Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002). Its generally accepted depth range is 15-370 metres, though a small juvenile was recently photographed in Nelson Bay, Port Stephens (NSW) at a depth of 7 metres (Bray 2018).","This is a highly-valued species in both commercial (mainly deep water line) and to a lesser extent recreational fisheries throughout its range (Sumpton <em>et al</em>. 2013, D. Pollard pers. comm. 2016). Smaller individuals can be taken as by-catch in fish traps and prawn trawls in shallower waters. Some of the catch from south-eastern Queensland is reportedly now being exported to Asia (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2016).",Marine,"This species is a component of managed fisheries in both New South Wales and southern Queensland, which includes limited commercial entry, total allowable catch limits, gear restrictions and closed areas where fishing is not permitted (Sumpton <em>et al. </em>2013). There is a recreational bag limit of fivefish in possession in New South Wales, but there is no minimum legal size. In southern Queensland, there is a bag limit of five groupers (of any species), and a size limit of 35 cm for all grouper species. However, compliance with fishing regulations is an issue as these fishing grounds are relatively remote, which causes enforcement to be more difficult to implement (Sumpton <em>et al</em>. 2013). Rowling (1995) suggested that reducing the catches of smaller fish would be beneficial to the stock. If spawning aggregations are located, then they should be protected from fishing (Pogonoski <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is recommended that catch trends be carefully monitored over coming years, and especially to improve estimates of catch per unit effort. There seem to be few or no marine protected areas which include the adult populations of this species, particularly as it occurs in deep water. More research is urgently needed on its biology and ecology, and especially on its age and growth (Sumpton<em> et al</em>. 2013, D. Pollard pers. comm. 2018).","",,false,false,Global
103110667,39399,Raja clavata,Near Threatened,,2016,2005-10-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This is an amended version of the 2005 assessment. The assessment has been amended to reflect newly available information which places this species in the genus Raja (formally Malacoraja).&#160;<br/>This assessment is based on the information published in the 2005 shark status survey (Fowler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>This demersal batoid is one of the most abundant elasmobranchs in the Northeastern Atlantic. The Thornback Skate (<em>Raja clavata</em>) is widespread, although the taxonomy of specimens from South Africa requires additional study. There is some limited evidence of a decline in landings in the northern part of the East Atlantic range of this species and management of the fishery is required. However, declines have not been as serious as reported for other large rajids.","The Thornback Skate is a demersal coastal species which inhabits a variety of substrates, including mud, sand, shingle, gravel and rocky areas, in water down to 300 m, although it is most abundant in 10-60 m of water off coastal areas (Wheeler 1969, Stehmann and Buerkel 1984). Rousset (1990a) studied the elasmobranch assemblage off the coast of Brittany and found that <em>R. clavata</em> was the most abundant rajid due to the fact that it was able to inhabit this range of benthic habitats. Thornback Skate is the second most important species, after the Smallspotted Catshark (<em>Scyliorhinus canicula</em>), in the demersal elasmobranch assemblage in the northern Bristol Channel and constitutes between 7.4-8.8% of the elasmobranch biomass (Ellis unpubl.). The age and growth of this species have been studied by examining the vertebrae of fish caught in the Bristol Channel (Ryland and Ajayi 1984), although Brander and Palmer (1985), using length-frequency analysis, have indicated inconsistencies for the smaller sized fish used in this work. Ryland and Ajayi (1984) gave maximum age and length of 12 years and 1,047 mm (k = 0.090). Vertebral growth rings have been shown to be annual (Holden and Vince 1973). Growth has also been estimated from tagging studies (Holden 1972). Validated age studies of specimens from the southern North Sea have shown thornback skates to have a maximum length of 118 cm for females and 98cm for males (Walker 1998). The size at maturity for females and males have been estimated at 45-50 cm disc width (DW) and 38-44 cm DW (Fitzmaurice 1974); 85 cm total length (TL) (54 cm DW) and 75 cm TL (48 cm DW) (Capapé 1976); 45 cm DW and 42 cm DW (Nottage and Perkins 1983) and 59 cm TL and 60 cm TL (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Walker (1998) estimated length at 50% maturity to be 77 cm TL for males and 68 cm TL for females. The corresponding ages at 50% maturity were eight and seven years. It has been reported that <em>R. clavata</em> first spawn in their fifth year (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Eggs are laid during a protracted breeding season from February to September (Holden 1975), with a peak in May and June. However, this is for the population as a whole and the egg-laying period for individual fish may be shorter. Ellis and Shackley (1995) maintained one female in captivity and reported that egg laying lasted six weeks, with a mean egg-laying rate of 1.07 eggs per day, a pair of eggs being laid on alternate days. These data concur with the observations of Holden (1971). Development lasts 16-20.5 weeks (Ellis and Shackley 1995), although this period may vary with temperature. The young hatch at a length of 10-13 cm. The nursery areas used are coastal, estuarine and tidal flat areas (e.g., the Wash and Thames estuary in the UK). The fecundity of <em>R. clavata</em> in British waters has been estimated at 150 eggs per year (Holden 1971), 140 eggs per year (Holden 1975) and 100 eggs per year (minimum of 62-74) (Ryland and Ajayi 1984). Capapé (1976, 1977a) estimated a fecundity of 70-167 eggs per year in Tunisian waters, although it may be as low as 48 (Ellis and Shackley 1995). The feeding habits have been well documented from many areas over its geographical range, including British waters (Holden and Tucker 1974, Ajayi 1982, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1996), Ireland (Fitzmaurice 1974), France (Du Buit 1968, 1978-79, Quiniou and Andriamirado 1979), Portugal (Marques and Re 1978, Cunha <em>et al.</em> 1986), the Mediterranean (Capapé 1975, 1977; Abdel-Aziz 1986), the Southeast Atlantic waters off Namibia (Macpherson 1986) and southern Africa (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 1991). Young and juvenile <em>R. clavata</em> predominantly eat small crustaceans, such as shrimps, mysids, amphipods and small crabs. Larger specimens prey on larger crustaceans, including prawns and crabs and will also consume fish. The migratory habits have been studied by Steven (1936) who found that very little movement occurred, especially in young fish, with 71% of tagged fish moving less than five miles. Fish tagged in the southern North Sea also showed a sedentary pattern, with 80% being recaptured within 40 nautical miles of their release position (Walker <em>et al.</em> 1997). The recapture percentage was nearly 30%. Fitzmaurice (1974) studied the populations within two bays in Ireland and reported a sex ratio of 1:1 and, of 71 tagged, eight (11.3%) recaptures. Rousset (1990b) observed that mature females were more common in exposed areas and juveniles and mature males were more common in more sheltered areas.","Thornback Skate is a very important component of demersal fisheries in most European waters and is taken by trawl and gillnet, particularly as bycatch. There is or has been limited directed longlining and netting for the species. Landings of this species are not known, as landings of all rajids are combined in the records (ICES 1958-1987). Holden (1963) looked at the species composition of rajids landed by commercial trawlers at Milford Haven and Fleetwood, UK, during 1961 and 1962 and <em>R. clavata</em> accounted for 34.9% and 12.72% respectively. There is no evidence of severe population depletion, as has been documented for the Common Skate (<em>Dipturus batis</em>), although landings are considered to be in decline and a management strategy is required. Thornback Skates are also regularly caught by recreational anglers, although mortality from this source of fishing pressure will be of little impact for the population as a whole, particularly in areas where catch and release is practised.",,Decreasing,"The Thornback Skate, or roker, is one of the most abundant rajids in north European coastal waters and can be the dominant rajid in commercial landings and research vessel catches (Rousset 1990a, Ellis unpubl.). It is widely distributed from Iceland and Norway (south of the Arctic Circle), to the North Sea (where it is now less abundant in south-eastern areas (Walker 1998), the Mediterranean, the western Black Sea, Madeira, the Atlantic coasts of Africa, and as far south as South Africa and the south-western Indian Ocean (Stehmann 1995). The status of this species in West and South African waters, and its relationship with <em>Raja (Raja) cf. clavata</em>, which is reported from the waters off Namibia and southern Africa (Macpherson 1986, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 1991, Smale and Cowley 1992) needs further research.",,Marine,"Several of the UK's local Sea Fisheries Committees have by-laws for a minimum landing size (e.g., 40 cm DW in the Southern and the Kent and Essex Sea Fisheries Districts). Such localised management initiatives will not, however, be of significant effect in conserving regional populations. Due to European rajid fisheries being a component of multispecies fisheries, which also target several species of flatfish and gadoid, gear restriction using mesh size is not a viable management measure. Minimum landing sizes have been implemented in some areas of the UK by Sea Fisheries Committees.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Survey work has failed to locate other individuals in and around Zanzibar, the adjacent Tanzanian coast and the wider East African region. Coastal rhinobatids are susceptible to capture in a variety of fishing gear including trawl, gillnet, line and seine net and their occurrence along inshore areas of the continental shelf makes these rays an easy target for such fisheries. Target fisheries for guitarfish currently exist in several countries particularly in the Indo-West Pacific and declines in some species have been documented. When taken, flesh is utilized and the fins of larger species (possibly including <em>A. zanzibarensis</em>) enter the international fin trade for the Asian market. Coastal waters of Zanzibar are consistently fished by artisanal fishers mostly using traditional vessels. A wide variety of gear is employed including drag nets, spear, handline, seine nets and fish traps. Rays are known to be caught and retained and shark fin is marketed. If <em>A. zanzibarensis</em> is restricted to the inshore continental shelf around Zanzibar, the majority of its available habitat would be fished by a variety of gear.

When taken flesh is utilized and the fins of larger species enter the international fin trade for the Asian market. It is probable that the fins of <em>A. zanzibarensis</em> enter the international market, as the large wedgefish <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em> is commercially exploited for its fins in Tanzanian waters in bottom-set gillnets, when taken in prawn trawls and possibly also by spearfishermen (Barnett 1997), suggesting that <em>R. zanzibarensis</em>, as a large guitarfish, is also a desirable catch. <br/> <br/>Coastal waters of Zanzibar are consistently fished by artisanal fishers mostly using traditional vessels (Jiddawi and Öhman 2002).

This species is typically found at depths &lt;12 m, but has been recorded to 91.5 m. This guitarfish has a generation length of 9 years and exhibits an annual reproductive cycle with litters of 1-16 pups.<br/><br/>In Mexican waters, this species is taken in directed artisanal elasmobranch fisheries in both the Gulf of California and on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is also retained as bycatch by demersal trawls and gillnets.

This species also occurs commonly in intertidal waters (&lt;1 m depth) to feed (J. Bizzarro, pers. comm. 2016). In Baja California, gravid females come during the spring and summer to give birth in shallow bays and estuaries (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Márquez-Farías 2007). Based on fisheries landings, males arrive in late summer to mate and then all individuals depart in the fall (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Considerable information on reproductive biology and age-growth has been gathered for this species from both the west coast of Baja California Sur (BCS) in Mexico (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, González-García 1998, Downton-Hoffmann 2001, Márquez-Farías 2007) and from Californian waters in the USA (Miller and Lea 1972, Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983, Timmons and Bray 1997). Life history parameters of Shovelnose Guitarfish can be quite different based on the location that the samples were taken, and the method of measuring the parameters.<br/><br/>This species is aplacental viviparous (bears live young nourished from a yolk sac) and has a continuous reproductive cycle. Gestation takes 4 to 5 months (Márquez-Farías 2007). Pregnant females may contain uterine capsules and large ripe ova in both ovaries at the same time, but the reproductive cycle is annual with a single litter per year (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Márquez-Farías 2007). Fecundity has been reported as 1 to 10 pups/litter (average five; Márquez-Farías 2007) and 6 to 16 pups/litter (Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993), with a 1:1 sex ratio at birth (Márquez-Farías 2007). Size at birth ranges from 20 to 24 cm TL (in San Quintin Bay, Baja California, Mexico; Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993), 15 cm TL (in Almejas Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico; Eschmeyer et al. 1983), and 17.5 cm TL (in Sonora, Mexico; Márquez-Farías 2007). Multiple estimates also exist for size at maturity ranging from 57–99 cm TL for females (Timmons and Bray 1997, Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Downton-Hoffman 1996, Márquez-Farías 2007) and &lt;63–110 cm TL for males (Timmons and Bray 1997, Villavicencio-Garayzar 1993, Downton-Hoffman 1996, Dubois 1981, Talent 1985, Márquez-Farías 2007). Age at maturity is estimated at 7 years for females and 7 to 8.4 years for males (Timmons and Bray 1997). Maximum size is estimated at 156 cm TL for females (Baxter 1966) and 114 cm TL for males (Downton-Hoffman 1996). Longevity is estimated at 11 years (Timmons and Bray 1997). Generation length is estimated to be 9 years (Timmons and Bray 1997).","The primary threat to the Shovelnose Guitarfish is most likely the directed artisanal fisheries in Mexico (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007). Pregnant females are frequently caught in the artisanal gillnet fishery on the west coast of Baja California (Salazar-Hermoso and Villavicencio 1999, Bizzarro 2005) and the coast of Sonora, Gulf of California, Mexico (Márquez-Farias 2002). Gillnet selectivity analysis revealed that mature individuals were most susceptible to capture in the fishery (Márquez-Farías 2005, Márquez-Farías 2011). Neonates and small juveniles are much less abundant in the directed fishery (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The Shovelnose Guitarfish is also taken as bycatch in demersal trawls (especially shrimp trawlers), and gillnets in Mexican waters. The high catches of mature individuals either by the directed artisanal fishery or in indirect landings most likely are having an effect on the population structure as well as the overall abundance of guitarfish (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007, Márquez-Farías 2011). In the Bahía Almejas summer batoid fishery, this species is the most abundant in June landings (<em>ca</em>. 51% of catch, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) = 21.8 individuals/vessel/day) landings and third most abundant in August landings (<em>ca</em>. 13%, CPUE=2.8 individuals/vessel/day). Catches of the fishery in Bahía Almejas, Baja California has steeply declined after greatly increased effort in the mid to late 1990s and its abundance has almost surely declined in this region as a result of fishing pressure. In Sonora, Mexico, the Shovelnose Guitarfish is the most abundant batoid landed in the artisanal elasmobranch fishery (Márquez-Farías 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition, the fishing derbies of Elkhorn Slough seem to have similarly drastically reduced the abundance of Shovelnose Guitarfish (Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>In the United States, this species is taken by recreational anglers to a limited extent and occasionally sold in local Asian markets in southern California.<br/><br/>The second largest threat to the Shovelnose Guitarfish is habitat modification. Many embayments and estuaries in the northwest Pacific region of Mexico are being modified for shrimp farming. Since this species uses these areas for feeding and reproduction, this could have a detrimental impact on its abundance in affected areas. In United States waters, many of the bays and estuaries have been modified, degraded or destroyed, restricting the coastal areas that can be used by the Shovelnose Guitarfish. It is unclear, however, whether this would significantly impact the survival, fecundity or population resilience of the species.","There is little information on the population status or trend for this species. Along the coast of northwest Mexico, including the Pacific coast of Baja California and around the Gulf of California, the Shovelnose Guitarfish is the most commonly landed elasmobranch species in the artisanal fisheries (Márquez-Farias 2002, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009, Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Bahía Almejas, Baja California elasmobranch fisheries reportedly targeted aggregations of this species. Despite this, researchers did not observe any negative effects on this species at the time of these surveys (1991-1995; Salazar-Hermoso and Villavicencio-Garayzar 1999). The Shovelnose Guitarfish was also the elasmobranch species most captured in the upper Gulf of California (Marquez-Farias 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009). It should be noted, however, that catch data reported as the Shovelnose Guitarfish may also include catches of Banded Guitarfish (<em>Zapteryx exasperata</em>). High fishing pressure recorded in this species could cause population declines, so this species should be monitored closely (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Mexican logbooks from fisheries targeting elasmobranchs group guitarfish under a general category, and these data show that reported guitarfish catches have ranged from &gt;1,000 metric tonnes (mt) live weight in 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2014; to between 846 and 937 mt in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2013 (CONAPESCA 2006-2014). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to detect, but effort is estimated to be relatively stable. Because all guitarfishes are grouped under a general category, population declines for this species may go undetected.<br/><br/>Landings of the Shovelnose Guitarfish are monitored in Californian waters, and have declined from 9.26-10.31 tonnes (t) in 2000-2002 to 0.13–1.05 t in 2012–2014 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000-2014). This is likely due to the reduction and redistribution of fishing pressure in the range of this species, and thus may not be correlated with a decline in abundance in Californian waters. In Elkhorn Slough, California, historical data from fishing derbies indicate that catches of the Shovelnose Guitarfish declined by 78% over three generations from the 1950s to the 1970s, and by the mid-1990s catches had undergone a 92% decline from 1950s levels (Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, these declines were recorded at the northern extent of this species range, and may be the result of changing environmental conditions, rather than a population decline driven by fishing. In southern California, the Shovelnose Guitarfish was found to be abundant in a small, restored coastal habitat (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2011) as well as in San Diego Bay (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002).",Decreasing,"This species is reported in coastal waters from San Francisco Bay, California to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico (Miller and Lea 1972, Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983).",This species is utilized for its meat and fins.,Marine,"There are currently no species-specific conservation measures in place in United States or Mexican waters.<br/><br/>In Mexico, a moratorium on the allocation of additional elasmobranch fishing permits was enacted in 1993, but no formal management plan has been implemented for the Shovelnose Guitarfish specifically. Mexico implemented a National Plan of Action (NPOA) in 2004, and began reporting some species-specific data to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). However, only 10% of catches were reported to species level in 2010, with most being grouped by order and above. The United States implemented a NPOA in 2001, with 25% of catches being reported to species level (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 2012). In 2007 Mexican officials approved Regulation NOM-029 which required fisheries targeting sharks to establish a logbook system, regulate fishing gear for small and medium sized fleets, and define areas where fishing is restricted. This species is recorded in these target fisheries, along with other guitarfish species, under the general category of ""pez guitarra"". In 2012 Mexico also developed a fishing ban on the Pacific Coast that takes place from May 31 to July 31. These efforts should help improve species-specific data, and provide an essential basis for detecting fishery trends and are needed throughout the species’ range.<br/><br/>In Californian waters, a network of 29 marine protected areas (MPAs) were implemented in 2007 under California's Marine Life Protection Act, representing approximately 204 square miles (~18%) of state waters in the central coast region (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000–2014). Due to these MPAs, most trawlers are restricted to operating in deeper waters, and only in central and northern California. As a result, fishing effort in the California trawl fishery has been reduced, and catches of this species have also likely been reduced (D. Ebert pers. obs. 2007). Finally, restoration of coastal habitats along the California coast provides areas for Shovelnose Guitarfish to feed, breed and escape predators, and there is evidence that these restored habitats are being used by this species (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2011).","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in shallow water, possibly to a depth of 40 m. It is taken as bycatch in subsistence, artisanal, and commercial fisheries with trawl, gillnet, and line gear and retained for human consumption. Moderate inshore fishing pressure is present throughout this species' range, although no adults are captured in the PNG trawl fishery, and it has some refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Merauke Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (32 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Merauke Stingray is benthic on soft substrate mainly nearshore in shallow water, possibly to a depth of 40 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b, Weigmann 2016, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). It reaches a maximum size of at least 37 cm disc width (DW), possibly larger as adults have not been recorded (Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is likely viviparous and size-at-birth is ~12 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). Little else is known about it's biology. Generation length is inferred from a similar sized ray that occurs in in similar latitude and habitats, that is, the Speckled Maskray (<em>Neotrygon picta</em>), that has a generation length of 10.8 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","The Merauke Stingray is captured in trawl, gillnet, and line fisheries and retained for human consumption.There is little unfished area within its distribution (M.I. Grant and A. Sianipar unpubl. data 2020). The Merauke Stingray's eastern distribution overlaps with the Gulf of Papua Prawn Trawl Fishery (GOPPTF) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). This species is caught incidentally in the GOPPTF, and elasmobranch bycatch survival in general for this fishery is reported as low, at ~4% (White <em>et al. </em>2019). This species is the 4th most common ray landed in the GOPPTF, with only immature individuals captured, including neonates (White <em>et al. </em>2019). In artisanal fisheries in the Western Province, there is heavy inshore gillnetting around Daru where this species is observed in local markets (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2020). In the Gulf Province, PNG, artisanal and subsistence fisheries mostly operate in low salinity waters of river estuaries, and very little interaction with this species is observed (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2020). This species may also be impacted by future proposed developments in the Gulf of Papua, PNG. There is presently inshore sand mining interest in the northeastern Gulf of Papua and intent to build a dam in the Wabo River within the Purari River basin (M.I.

It is demersal on the continental shelf from estuarine inshore waters to a depth of 100 m. The species is a target and bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, set net, gillnet, and longline and retained for human  consumption; it is an economically important species in Japan. It is common in Japan, abundant in South Korea, and commonly landed in Taiwan and China, although anecdotally there has been a slight decrease in landings in China in the past 10 years<strong>. </strong>Reconstructed catches of this species in Taiwan indicate a decline of 65% over the past three generation lengths (36 years), however, it is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches coincided with a decline in fishing effort. Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the species' entire range, yet it is still common and abundant. This species has a very high biological productivity, which would provide  resilience to fishing pressure and may account for its continued high  abundance in areas where it is commercially targeted.  Despite this abundance, there are some declines in landings of this species and the high levels of fishing pressure across its  entire range  and overfishing in parts of its range are a cause for concern. It is  suspected that the Red Stingray is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Red Stingray is demersal on the continental shelf on sandy habitats at depths of 0–100 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, A. Yamaguchi, and S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). It can tolerate fluctuating salinities in estuaries and migrates in winter to deeper waters of 50–100 m depth (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010, Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019, A. Yamaguchi, and S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 90 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 32 cm DW and females mature at 50 cm DW (Taniuchi and Shimizu 1993, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with lipid histotrophy, and it has litter sizes of 7–25 pups, an annual reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of<strong> </strong>11 cm DW; this fecundity is the highest reported for any batoid species with this reproductive strategy (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019). Ages are inferred from the related Kuhl's Maskray (<em>Neotrygon kuhlii</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 6.5 years and a maximum age of 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","The Red Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, set net, gillnet, and longline and is retained for human consumption. It is an economically important species in Japan where it is targeted in some Prefectures, such as Saga and Fukuoka, usually with longline and sometimes gillnet and mostly in shallow estuarine waters. Mature females are retained as they are valued meat and males, which are often smaller, are discarded (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019). Post-release survival may be high as the species is considered hardy, with species retained live for market densely packed in tanks (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In Ariake Bay, Japan, this species is the most commonly captured stingray taken by gillnet, demersal trawl, and longline (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019). It is also taken as part of a predator control program implemented in Ariake Bay in 2001 to protect shellfish. However, catch data are not available to assess the impact of the predator control program on this species (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019). Across Japan, demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since  the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries  during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly  2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from  ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an  increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the  catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased  and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less  valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture  (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s, the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ rose from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ peaked in 1989 at 15,900, and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans but remains steady for fishing rafts (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region.<a name=""_Hlk35497192""> In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of tidal flats since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al. </em>2014). </a>In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).","The Red Stingray is common in Japan and abundant in South Korea (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019, C-H Jeong unpubl. data 2019).

It inhabits estuaries and sand flats near seagrasses and coral reefs from the surface down to a depth of 100 m. This species has considerable value through ecotourism interactions with tourists in some Caribbean Islands which may have negative consequences on individual rays.&#160;This species is targeted and captured as bycatch in artisanal trammel nets, gillnets, beach seines, and longlines, and in commercial trawl and longline fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive with suspected high survivorship in US waters. It is caught as bycatch in the western Atlantic and is utilised, and even targeted, in artisanal fisheries across part of the southern portion of its range. In the Northwest Atlantic, the relative abundance time series based on Baited Remote Underwater Videos from 2009 to 2018 off Belize indicated that abundance increased over the time series at a rate of 9.6% per year. Landings data from Mexico from 2000 to 2014 suggests a general stable population (annual rate of change +0.5%). However, a trawl survey indicated a slight decline of 4.1% over one generation length (11 years). When all data sets are considered in the global analysis, the population was declining slightly (-0.1% per year). In Colombia, the Southern Stingray was nationally assessed as Near Threatened due to the level of exploitation and habitat degradation. Considering the relative area of habitat in Northwest Atlantic and  Atlantic South America, Southern Stingray is suspected to have undergone a  population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths  (32 years), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Southern Stingray inhabits sandflats near seagrasses and coral reefs to a depth of 100 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 51 cm DW and females mature at 75–80 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth annually to 2–7 pups, with a size-at-birth of17–19 cm DW (after 5–8 months of gestation when in captivity) (Ramírez-Mosqueda&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

Southern Stingray are harvested in parts of South America and fisheries exist in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. Despite these fisheries, this stingray has shown signs of stability in several areas, and is productive enough to withstand some fishing pressure, but has also shown to be more susceptible in other areas where fishing is most intense.</p>","<p>There are no data on the population size of Southern Stingray. In the Northwest Atlantic, the relative abundance of this species is considered stable throughout its range in the Caribbean region and it is present in 81% of all the surveyed reefs (D. Cardeñosa and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019). In the southern Gulf of Mexico off Mexico, landings from the artisanal gillnet and mainly longline fisheries are considered stable from 2006 to 2014 (Lara-Mendoza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In Honduras (Roatan Island), a reduction in the size of the population was reported from 2016 to 2017 but no further data on this decline is available (MarAllianz Honduras unpubl. data 2019). It is abundant in nearshore waters in the northeast Gulf of Mexico,  especially along the west coast of Florida and is common during summer  months in estuaries and coastal areas along the east coast of the U.S.  It is common throughout most of the Greater and Lesser Antilles.</p><p>Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) from Belize based on baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) (G.

Pérez-Jiménez pers. comm. 21/6/2019). These trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Sherley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;First, the relative abundance time series based on BRUVs from 2009 to 2018 (G. Clementi and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019) off Belize indicated that abundance increased over the time series at a rate of 9.6% per year. Second, data from a trawl survey (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) indicated a decline of 4.1% over one generation (15.8 years). Third, landings data from Mexico from 2000 to 2014 suggests a general stable population (annual rate of change +0.5%) (CONAPESCA 2019, J.C. Pérez-Jiménez pers. comm. 21/6/2019).&#160;When all data sets are considered in the global analysis, the annual rate of change over all data series was -0.1%. The corresponding probabilities were in Least Concern (51%), Endangered (20%) and Critically Endangered (16%).&#160;In the southwest Atlantic, there are no range-wide estimates of population size for this species.

Although there are no trend data from the Southwest Atlantic, there have been anecdotal declines in some areas, especially where these animals are targeted (for example in nursery areas off Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018). Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Colombia, this stingray has been exploited since the 1970s and has a high commercial value, and artisanal fisheries there are widespread and unmanaged. There is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery in Caribbean Colombia for which stocks have collapsed (P. Me<span class=""st"">j<span class=""st"">ía-Falla and A. Navia unpubl. data 2018). At the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery<span class=""st"">. There are small-scale demersal set longline fisheries there that capture this species and it is used for local consumption (D. Cardeñosa unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015), and this species has been noted in gillnet fisheries such as the one operating off Margarita Island (González‐González and Ehemann 2018). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks there were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In Cear<span class=""st"">á State, there has been a trawl ban implemented in one locality, and this species has shown signs of increased abundance there (V. Faria unpubl. data 2018). Longnose Stingrays are targeted heavily in artisanal beach seine fisheries in the northeast of Brazil. For example, suspected nursery grounds for this species are targeted and considered to be over-exploited in Rio Grande do Norte (F.M. Santana unpubl. data 2018).&#160;The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). This stingray has been recognized as a bycatch in these trawl fisheries, and even when discarded suffers substantial injury and may not survive (Rodrigues&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Due to the actual and potential levels of exploitation across its shallow inshore range, the fact that it has exhibited declines where it is targeted, and its large size, it is suspected that the Longnose Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation (32 years) in Atlantic South America. Taking together the relative area of habitat in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (32 years).&#160;<span style="""">Due to its similar habitat use and biology to Southern Stingray (<em>Hypanus americanus</em>), but more southerly distribution in areas of intense fishing pressure a status of Near Threatened was inferred.</span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Longnose Stingray occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from the Gulf of Campeche, Mexico, to Paraná, Barzil (Barletta and Correa 1989)&#160;including the Caribbean Islands (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","This stingray is utilised for subsistence food and is sold locally, and the white flesh is considered valuable.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to a depth of 90 m.&#160;Throughout its distribution, it is taken as target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries. In Indonesia, it is consumed fresh or salted and dried while it is discarded in Australia and from Papua New Guinea industrial fisheries. In Indonesia, the population is suspected to be stable or increasing  likely in part because of mesopredator release due to decreasing shark  populations. There is fishing pressure throughout this species' range, and although it is possibly increasing in Indonesia, this is a small portion of its range. Although the <em>Neotrygon</em> genus requires further taxonomic resolution, based on the current distribution and understanding of fishing pressure through the entire range of the <em>Neotrygon</em> genus, it is suspected that the Australian Bluespotted Maskray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Australian Bluespotted Maskray is demersal on shallow soft substrates in inshore brackish habitats and ranges from the surface to a depth of 90 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b, C.S. Sherman unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of ~38 cm disc width (DW) and males mature at ~28 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Reproduction is viviparous but little else is known of its biology. As there is no information on the age-at-maturity and maximum age of this species, generation length was inferred to be 8 years, which is scaled based on the slightly larger Coral Sea Maskray (<em>Neotrygon trigonoides</em>), which attains a maximum size of 47 cm DW (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","The Australian Bluespotted Maskray is taken as target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries throughout its range. The species is found on sandy substrates, hence, is susceptible to trawl fishing (C.S. Sherman unpubl. data 2020). There is a long history of demersal trawl fishing activities in northern Australia and the Gulf of Papua, starting in 1954 (White <em>et al</em>. 2019). In the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), Australia this species has been recorded as Kuhl's Maskray (<em>N. kuhlii</em>) and is commonly taken as bycatch which is discarded (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002, White <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Neotrygon </em>spp. comprise 40–67% of the total elasmobranch trawl catch in the NPF (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tonks et al. 2007). Turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) were introduced in the early 2000s in the NPF to reduce elasmobranch bycatch, however, TEDs are less effective at excluding smaller species, like the Australian Bluespotted Maskray (Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2006). Post-release survival is expected to be low as retention in the cod-end of trawls nets creates a risk of internal and external injury.<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, a prawn trawl fishery that began in 1969 operates year-round in the Gulf of Papua, and it operates across most of this species range in the country (White <em>et al</em>. 2019, M.I. Grant pers. comm. 10 October 2020). Despite being limited to 15 trawlers operating each season, this fishery contributes significantly to the economy of Papua New Guinea and is the second-largest export fishery after tuna (Unasi 2016). The fishery catches 2.8 individuals from the <em>Neotrygon </em>genus per 100 fishing hours with only some retention. For those discarded, post-release survival is low at ~4% (White <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>The Australian Bluespotted Maskray is targeted and taken as bycatch and retained in artisanal and industrial fisheries throughout the Indonesian portion of its range. Members of the <em>Neotrygon </em>genus are commonly caught by Bajau Laut in Indonesia using harpoons. Members of the <em>Neotrygon </em>genus comprise 8.2% of all rays landed in the markets of Singapore that are captured in Indonesian waters and are the second most commonly landed ray species (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 6 May 2020). <em>Neotrygon </em>spp. are the most commonly landed small rays observed in markets throughout Indonesia (C.S. Sherman unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There are no species-specific data on the population trend of Australian Bluespotted Maskray. In Indonesia, the population is possibly increasing due to mesopredator release as there is evidence of increases in ray abundance related to decrease in shark presence due to overfishing (Sherman <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, with continued fishing pressure on elasmobranchs in Indonesia, this species may experience population declines there in the future.<br/><br/>The Australian Bluespotted Maskray is small and likely productive, and thus it can withstand some higher levels of fishing pressure than many other elasmobranchs. However, it has little refuge from fishing pressure across its range and although it is possibly increasing in Indonesia due to mesopredator release, this is a small portion of its range. The low post-release mortality is of concern, and it is suspected that the Australian Bluespotted Maskray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% in the past three generation lengths (24 years).",Decreasing,"The Australian Bluespotted Maskray occurs in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans in eastern Indonesia, Timor-Leste, northern Australia, and southern Papua New Guinea (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). However, its true distribution is not entirely resolved due to taxonomic uncertainty (W.T. White pers. comm. 15 October 2020).",The Australian Bluespotted Maskray meat is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption in the Indonesian portion of its range (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). It is likely sold fresh for human consumption in local markets in Papua New Guinea (M.I. Grant pers. comm. 10 October 2020). It is not known to be used in Australia.,Marine,"There are no species-specific measures in place. In the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in Australia, Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) were introduced in the early 2000s and although effective at excluding large sharks and raays, they are less effective at excluding smaller species, like the Australian Bluespotted Maskray (Griffiths <em>et al.</em> 2006). The Gulf of Papua trawl fishery is managed by the National Fisheries Authority of Papua New Guinea and there are some seasonal closures in place and a limit of 15 vessels operating per season (Unasi 2016). In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future (Dharmadi pers. comm. 25 May 2020).&#160;Within Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas making up 239,428 km², which may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020).

107249015,245,Acipenser oxyrinchus,Near Threatened,,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida. Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> occurs in most major river systems from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River in Florida and in marine waters of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico south to Florida Bay. <br/> <br/>As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997, although Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River and in the Saint John River. The current number of mature individuals most likely numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy for this subspecies is very large (&gt;1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline). Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and re-colonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations. Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution.  Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. The subspecies is assessed as Near Threatened based on past population declines and because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery. <br/> <br/>Records for <em>A. o. desotoi</em> fisheries during the period 1887–1985 indicated that peak Florida harvest occurred in 1900–1902 (124 mt/year) followed by precipitous decline into the 1920s.  From 1923–1971 harvest was fairly stable at about 7 mt per year; declined to 2.3 mt through the 1970s; and fell further to only 0.3 mt until fisheries were closed in 1986 (Barkuloo 1988). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. With a relatively small and widely scattered population, continued habitat disturbances and contaminant threats, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>Overall, the Atlantic sturgeon <em>A. oxyrinchus</em> is considered Near Threatened based on the population declines suffered in the past and uncertainties about overall health of the population and the lengthy time required for recovery.","The Atlantic sturgeon is a large anadromous species. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> is recorded to live for up to 60 years and reach a size of 4.3 m and 368 kg (Vladykov and Greely 1963), though most mature fish are considerably smaller. Spawning occurs in fresh or slightly brackish water when water temperatures reached 13–18˚C. Migrations into coastal tidal rivers begin as early as February in the southern portion of the range and continue through June and July in northernmost waters. In the mid-Atlantic area, Atlantic sturgeon males mature at 6–10 years and females at 10–20 years (ASMFC 1990). Maturation occurs earlier in southern waters and later in Canada. Spawning periodicity ranges from 2–6 years. Based on tagging studies ocean migrations of up to 1,450 km have been recorded (Dovel and Berggren 1983).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. <br/> <br/>Competition, predation, diseases and parasites were evaluated in the 1998 status review by USFWS-NMFS and determined not to be limiting factors for Atlantic sturgeon stocks. Throughout the 20th century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution. Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. Continued application of existing U.S. laws (e.g., Clean Water Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, etc.) should result in improvements sturgeon breeding and nursery habitats. With management measures in place the current population trend for Atlantic sturgeon is increasing. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. Tissue and egg samples of Gulf sturgeon have shown elevated levels of pesticides and heavy metals. Organochlorines such as DDT and its derivatives DDD and/or DDE and toxaphene appear in most samples, sometime in concentrations exceeding U.S. Federal Drug Administration action levels for human consumption. High concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons (both from petroleum products) were detected in most Gulf sturgeon samples from numerous Florida rivers. Arsenic and mercury were detected in 92% and 87% of sturgeon samples and cadmium occurred in 42% of samples (Bateman and Brim 1994).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. The largest fishery was in the Delaware River and Bay which by 1890 supported over 1,000 fishermen and produced 2,300 metric tons of sturgeon product. Several dozen other rivers supported sturgeon fisheries and by the late 1890s, total Atlantic Coast U.S. landings reached 3,200 mt. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. Throughout the 1970s to mid-1980s, prior to declaration of fishing moratoria, annual U.S. harvest of Atlantic sturgeon ranged from 50–100 mt with most fish being taken from the Hudson River (NY), coastal New Jersey and the Carolinas (ASMFC 1990). <br/> <br/>In 1998, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a comprehensive ""Status Review of Atlantic Sturgeon"" in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The assessment found that, though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). The number of mature individuals in this range-wide population was not estimated but most likely it numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy is very large (&gt; 1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline).  Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and recolonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations.   <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> population estimates have been completed for the Apalachicola, Suwannee, Yellow and Choctawhatchee rivers in Florida, Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and the Pearl and Bogue Chitto rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Suwannee River supports the most viable subpopulation among coastal rivers of the Gulf of Mexico and was estimated at 7,650 individuals older than age two (Sulak and Clugston 1999). The subpopulation estimate for Gulf sturgeon older than age two in the Choctawhatchee River ranges from 1,700–3,000 fish, while subpopulation estimates  in the Apalachicola, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers range from 50–350 fish (Lorio 2000). The number of mature individuals in this range wide population were not estimated but most likely number less than 10,000. Eggs and larvae of Gulf sturgeon have been collected in the Bouie, Escambia/Conecuh, Choctawatchee, Apalachicola and Suwanee rivers (Critical Habitat Ruling). <br/> <br/>Stabile <em>et al</em>. (1996) analyzed <em>A. o. desotoi</em> subpopulations from eight drainages along the Gulf of Mexico for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences among Gulf sturgeon stocks and suggested they displayed region-specific affinities and may exhibit river-specific fidelity. These authors identified five regional or river-specific stocks: (1) Lake Ponchartrain and Pearl River; (2) Pascagoula River; (3) Escambia and Yellow rivers; (4) Choctawhatchee River; and (5) Apalachicola, Ochlockonee, and Suwannee rivers.",Increasing,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida.

Though the subspecies was previously listed as also occurring in Mexico, a review of the literature fails to support that contention. A single ""sturgeon"" was reported seen (but not captured) in the Rio Grande River which separates Texas and Mexico. The Gulf sturgeon’s current area of occupancy is spread over 2,500+ river km and 1,500+ km of coastline. However, construction of dams, sills and other water control structures throughout the 20th century severely restricted inland migrations of Gulf sturgeon in many waterways from St. Andrew Bay to the Bogue Chitto River. <br/> <br/>For more information see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997. Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec) for subadults of <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em>, and in the Saint John River (New Brunswick) for larger fish. Also, a single fisherman is licensed on the Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. The St. Lawrence fishery was limited in 1997 to a quota of 6,015 fish - about 60 tons (Caron and Trembly 1997). Other regulations here include a maximum size limit of 1.5 m during a season extending from 1 May to 30 September. <br/> <br/>Peak landings on the Saint John River were 44 metric tones (mt) in 1988 but have declined in recent years to 10–14 mt. Only nine licensed fishermen remained in the St. John fishery in 1997. They were authorized to fish no more than 2,800 m of gill net with minimum mesh size of 33 cm. Minimum allowable size of sturgeon on the St. John is 120 cm and the season is closed during 1–30 June to protect spawners. Canadian authorities have expressed to U.S. authorities that these harvest levels are sustainable and do not damage the stocks (USFWS and NMFS 1998). A private aquaculture activity also occurs in New Brunswick with eggs and progeny produced from wild-caught adult sturgeon. Except for a few hundred live juveniles, most international trade in <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> in the late 1990s has been meat (2–34 mt/year) from Canada to the U.S. (CITES data). <br/> <br/>No commercial or sport fishing for Atlantic sturgeon is allowed in territorial waters of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The management authority for this species is the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and their amendment to the 1990 Fishery Management Plan (ASMFC 1998) requires (1) no possession allowed in the 15 Atlantic states until at least 20 year-classes reach breeding age (30–40 years); (2) annual reporting of by-catch and by-catch mortality; (3) urges habitat monitoring and improvements as well as research and genetics analysis; and (4) places certain restrictions on sturgeon culture for market production and restocking.  In addition to the ASMFC action, the Secretary of Commerce has closed all U.S. Atlantic coastal EEZ waters to harvest of Atlantic sturgeon. <br/> <br/>The recent USFWS-NMFS joint status review for Atlantic sturgeon determined that listing this species as threatened or endangered under the U.S. ESA is not warranted at this time. Atlantic sturgeon are widespread and several subpopulations could be considered relatively abundant. However, because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery, USFWS has designated Atlantic sturgeon as a ""candidate species"" for possible future ESA listing and NMFS lists it as a ""species of concern"". <br/> <br/>In 1991, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then considerable work has been accomplished to better define life history and behavior and to determine habitats important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment and fish culture. A recovery and management plan for Gulf sturgeon was completed in 1995 (USFWS and GSMFC 1995). This plan identifies state and federal actions necessary to rebuild populations to levels that would allow de-listing of the subspecies. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service officially designated ""critical habitat"" for this species, including 2,783 river kilometers and 6,042 square km of estuarine and marine habitat. <br/> <br/>With federal protection under the ESA and intensive permitting and consultation requirements for all water-related projects and discharges - especially in areas designated to be critical habitat - it is believed that <em>A. o. desotoi</em> population declines will be halted and reversed.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Guitarfish are commonly caught in gillnet, trawl and line fisheries throughout the region, but specific threats to this species are poorly known due to the lack of information on distribution and fisheries data. Declines of several species of inshore guitarfish have been documented within the region and present levels of catches are of concern. Limited available information for this species makes assessment difficult, but it is suspected to have declined by &lt;30% across its range given the regular capture in Pakistan where fishing is intense. Furthermore, ongoing fishing is suspected to result in a future decline over the next three generation periods (2017-2032). The species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting VU A2d+3d). Further investigation of this species is required to accurately define its range, biology, extent of catches in local fisheries and levels of declines. This assessment should be revisited as soon as this is available.",The Salalah Guitarfish is known from depths of 10 to over 100 m. Presumably the species occurs over soft substrates. Males mature at about 62 cm total length (TL) and reach a maximum of at least 78 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Generation length is inferred to be 5 years from the Lesser Guitarfish (<em>Acroteriobatus annulatus</em>)&#160;from southern Africa (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 1989).,"Threats to this species are unknown because of the lack of information on distribution and fisheries data. However, coastal rhinobatids are susceptible to capture in a variety of fishing gear including trawl, gillnet, line and seine net and their occurrence along inshore areas of the continental shelf means that rhinobatids are commonly captured.&#160;In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).","This species has been caught in demersal trawls and longlines at depths ranging from 10 to over 100 m (Henderson and Reeve 2011) and yet the limited number of specimens recorded after intensive landing site surveys in Oman could indicate that it is generally uncommon or that it occurs offshore at depths (&gt;100 m) where artisanal fishermen do not operate. Small numbers of this species are reportedly landed regularly on the Pakistan coast.<br/><br/>To date there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for this species. Further research is needed in order to determine population size and trends in abundance. However, significant declines in wedgefish and guitarfish (including rhinobatids) landings have been documented in other parts of the region. For example, landings surveys in the UAE in recent years have demonstrated a rapid decline despite ongoing fishing effort of the Halavi Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus halavi</em>); 10-20 individuals were regularly observed during 2010-2012, while landings of 1-2 individuals were more common five years later (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data). Furthermore, data available from Maharashtra, India, although outside the area of occurrence of this species, further demonstrate the declines in inshore batoid landings in an area where there are also high trawler numbers (5,613 trawlers in that state; CMFRI 2010). There, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).

This small benthic shark is not targeted but appears to be a major bycatch element of trawl (and other) fisheries, although it is hardy to trawl capture and aerial exposure, and may have relatively high post-capture survival rates. Apparently it is little utilised in the Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') but probably is used in Pakistan and India.<br/><br/>The species is threatened by habitat loss and degradation throughout its range. It is known to have a close association with coral reef habitats, which are particularly prone to anthropogenic degradation and there is evidence that such habitats have been severely degraded or lost in some parts of the Gulf, in addition to stress placed on these systems by climate change. More generally, it is exposed to widespread habitat loss and modification, not least in the Gulf (e.g., modification of the Tigris/Euphrates system), coastal developments and effects to benthic communities from demersal trawling throughout much of its range. It is also known to accumulate organic pollutants such as PAHs.<br/><br/>The threats of fishing and habitat degradation are likely to continue into the future and increase in intensity and coverage (for example, fishing pressure continues to increase in India and elsewhere). As a result of these combined factors, this species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets A2cd) based on inferred continuing population declines approaching 30% in the last three generations (~27 years), particularly as a result of habitat loss. Given that this species is often discarded (in the Gulf at least) and a proportion of discards may have a relatively high survival rate, a threatened category is not yet warranted, but the species is suspected to meet Near Threatened (nearly meets VU 3cd) over the next three generation period (2017-2044). There is a need for quantitative distribution and abundance data.","<p>The Arabian Carpetshark occurs in coastal waters in coral reefs, lagoons, rocky shores, muddy bottoms and mangrove estuaries from 2-100 m. This shark is less than 10 cm total length (TL) at birth, but grows to a maximum length of 80 cm TL (Weigmann 2016). Females mature at 52 cm TL and males at about 55 cm TL (Moore and Peirce 2013). The species is oviparous, with single egg cases developing in each uterus. It appears to be closely associated with coral reefs. Age data are not available, but generation length is estimated as 9 years using data from the similar-sized White-spotted Bambooshark (<em>C. plagiosum</em>) (Chen <em>et al. </em>2007).</p>","This is a hardy species that is taken as bycatch mostly in trawls and stake nets; it is usually discarded at sea. The species has low market value. A shrimp bycatch study undertaken between 1987 and 1989 in Kuwait suggests that of the 34,750 to 55,500 tons of bycatch quantities, more than 98% were discarded with the discarded fish comprised of 14% carpet sharks (Ye <em>et al</em>. 2000, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is likely to be an important factor. The Arabian Carpetshark is known to have close association with coral reef habitats, which are particularly prone to anthropogenic degradation and the effects of climate change (Carpenter <em>et al</em>. 2008, Normile 2016). In the Gulf this includes changes due to the damming of the Tigris-Euphrates river system in Turkey and the drainage of the Iraqi marshes (Al-Yamani <em>et al</em>. 2007), chronic and acute (e.g., war-related) releases of oil, rapid large-scale coastal development (e.g., megastructures in the UAE), and changes to benthic communities from demersal trawling. Coastal land reclamation has accelerated in this area in recent years and, as a result, coastal reefs and other habitat have been destroyed. For example, this has resulted in the almost total loss of mangrove areas around Bahrain (Morgan 2006a).<br/><br/>High levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzo [a] pyrene reported from this species from Kuwait (Al-Hassan <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>In India, declines in general catch rates, biomass, recruitment and shifts in regular landing patterns in inshore fisheries have been linked to steep increases in the fisher population, number and efficiency of craft and gears, and associated fishing effort, as well as the degradation of coastal habitats (mangroves, coral reefs, etc.) caused by pollution of coastal waters, urbanization, coastal developments, etc. (Morgan 2006b). Although no specific data are available it is reasonable to assume that this species has been impacted.<br/><br/>The species is commonly used in aquaria, e.g., in Kuwait (Tony McEwan Kuwait Scientific Centre pers. comm. to A.B.

There are various forms across its range (Red Sea to India), but until taxonomy is resolved, the forms in the Arabian Seas region are treated as a single species for the current assessment. This species appears to be very common in waters less than 40 m deep, including in intertidal areas. Given its size it is likely to have a productive life history, but this needs to be confirmed with species-specific research. It is regularly caught in shallow water trawls and is normally discarded at sea in the western part of its range, but landed in considerable numbers in the eastern part (i.e., India). Overall, fishing pressure is increasing across its habitat, and declines in batoids have been documented in India. At one landing site, catches have been stable over a 15 year period after an initial increase. However, over that same time period, trawl effort doubled. Overall, declines of &lt; 30% are suspected over the last three generations (~33 years), and with ongoing fishing pressure, further population declines are suspected over the next three generations (2017-2050); the species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting VU A2d+3d). Uncertainty arising from unresolved taxonomy, the unknown fate of discards, and uncertainty about its life history, all support a precautionary approach. Indeed, it is possible that in the near future the intense trawling pressure in parts of its range could lead to further declines and make it eligible for listing as Vulnerable if not higher.</p>","This species is very common in shallow and intertidal waters mostly to 30 m, but occasionally 40 m (Akhilesh K.V. pers. comm. 05/02/2017), over soft substrates. It is a very small species, only growing to 32 cm disc width (DW). Data from the <em>H. imbricata</em> form show that males mature about 18 cm DW and females by at least 23 cm DW (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). Born at 7-10 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). No data on litter size is available, but given the small size it is likely to be low. Similarly, no data on frequency of breeding is available. No ageing data are available. Generation length is estimated from the similar-sized Speckled Maskray (<em>Neotrygon picta</em>) from Australia that matures at 3-4 years and reaches a maximum age of 18 years, yielding a generation length of ~11 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","<p>                   The Scaly Whipray is a small species of whipray that is regularly caught as bycatch in trawls within its range and the main threat to this species is shallow water trawl fisheries that can catch large numbers. The high level of increasing exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et </em>al. 2006). The Scaly Whipray is normally discarded at sea in the western part of the range, but retained and marketed in the eastern part. Post release survival is unknown and needs to be investigated.<br/><br/>Its occurrence in very shallow water also makes it susceptible to coastal development and habitat degradation. Marine habitats in the Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010) which is likely to impact this species.</p>","Gillnet and trawl surveys in northern Kuwait (near the Iraq border) in 2004-05 recorded the species (as <em>Himantura imbricata</em>) as the second most abundant elasmobranch (Bishop <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has been recorded (as <em>H. imbricata</em>) in small numbers in fish markets in Kuwait and Qatar (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species is very common bycatch in shallow trawls in Iran (7-8% of rays caught [by weight]), but it is normally discarded (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 05/02/2016). It appears to be more common in the northern Gulf than in the southern, although this could be due to its susceptibility to trawls. During recent research surveys using trawls in UAE waters, it constituted a significant proportion of ray catches (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 31/03/2017). It is rarely recorded in Oman (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007). The small size of this species means that it is often discarded at sea, thus making the collection of data from landing sites difficult. In the Red Sea, it appears uncommon due to the limited amounts of suitable habitats (Bonfil 2003, I. Elhassan unpub. data).<br/><br/>The population has declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same paper showed that landings of this species (as <em>Amphotistius imbricatus</em>) were stable, indicating that it is an abundant species in trawl catches, but still declining due to trawl effort doubling during this period. In Pakistan, it is regularly captured, and there is evidence that the abundance has declined since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). Overall, declines of &lt;30% are suspected over the last three generations (~33 years), and with ongoing fishing pressure, further population declines are suspected over the next three generations (2017-2050)",Decreasing,"The Scaly Whipray is endemic to the Arabian Seas region, although its true distribution is unclear due to significant taxonomic issues, and research is urgently required to resolve this. Forms apparently consistent with the illustration in Last <em>et al</em>. (2016) appear to be present in eastern Iran waters of the Sea of Oman (F. Owfi unpub. data). However, specimens from the northern Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') (Kuwait and Iran; previously reported as <em>Himantura imbricata</em>) appear notably different (A.B.M. Moore unpub. data) and more consistent with the Bengal Whipray (<em>Brevitrygon imbricata</em>), a species that Last <em>et al</em>. (2016) report only from the Bay of Bengal region. Additional variation is evident in India.

The species is taken as bycatch in mainly demersal trawl, and possibly set and gillnet, fisheries and retained. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data from Sabah of all sharks, rays, and skates combined and all whiprays, and from all rays combined from the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone can be used to infer declines of 60–95% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Although these are not species-specific, they are&#160;informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Fishing pressure is moderate across its range and it is only caught occasionally with most records from research surveys, that suggest limited interactions with fisheries.

It reaches a maximum size of at least 53 cm total length (TL), size-at-maturity is unknown but a male was mature by 40 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016a). Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the similar-sized Sharpspine Skate (<em>Okamejei acutispina</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 7.2 years and a maximum age of 13.2 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.2 years (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2011).","<p>The Sulu Ring Skate is likely taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with mainly trawl, and possibly set net and gillnet, and retained for human consumption. It is reported as caught occasionally by trawlers off eastern Borneo, Malaysia (Last <em>et al. </em>2010). Across Malaysia,  unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant  that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and  Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950  across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020).  The number of vessels across all sectors has tripled in Sarawak from  2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2014, with fishing effort in  Sabah also rising, particularly in artisanal fisheries (Teh <em>et al. </em>2009, Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). There has been, and still is, a currently  rising trend in fish  consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this  comes from within  the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A.

Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined  over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO  2020). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ  significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400  vessels) and mostly use trawls, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em>  2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500  vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size  has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine  power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels  (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the  location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data  2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high  with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to  34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><br/></span></p>","No data are available on the population trend of the Sulu Ring Skate.

This species is caught and retained as bycatch in several fisheries including industrial crustacean trawl and small-scale gillnet fisheries throughout most of its range. While the population trajectory is stable at the southern end of its range in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, it is suspected to be declining throughout the rest of its range as a result of largely unregulated&#160;trawl and gillnet fisheries. In Zanzibar, this species was reportedly the most common elasmobranch present in small-scale landings reported in 96% of fisher interviews in the mid-1990s. Later work including a recent year-long survey of 21 landings sites in Kenya, Zanzibar, and northern Madagascar did not record any individuals.&#160;Although the species may have some refuge at depth and in South Africa (where management exists and the population trajectory is suspected&#160;to be stable), a reported severe reduction in landings in Zanzibar, combined with the intensity and expanding nature of fisheries in other parts of its range, the overall susceptibility of angel sharks to population depletion due  to their life-history characteristics, and declines in many other angel  sharks globally in areas with similar fisheries, it is suspected that a population reduction in mature individuals of 20-30% has occurred over the past three generations (69 years) for this species. The African Angelshark is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d). Monitoring should be undertaken to ensure that this species does not become threatened in the near future.","The African Angelshark is a demersal species that is found on the continental shelf and upper slope on sand and mud substrates, from the surf line to 494 m depth, although most specimens have been taken from 60-300 m (Compagno 1984, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Individuals caught in the prawn trawl fishery over the Thukela Banks have been identified as juveniles and therefore there may be a nursery area nearby (Fennessy 1994). The occasional catch (25 per annum; G. Cliff unpubl. data 2018) of this species in the KZN shark nets (east coast of South Africa) comprised mainly mature individuals of both sexes and 44% of the mature females examined were pregnant (Shelmerdine and Cliff 2006). <br/><br/>The species is lecithotrophic viviparous and gives birth to live young that are 28-30 cm total length (TL) with a gestation length of approximately one year and litter sizes of around six (range 1-12) (Shelmerdine and Cliff 2006). Males mature at 77-95 cm TL and females at 82-107 cm TL. Maximum known size is 122 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Although the generation length of the African Angelshark is unknown, it is suspected to be similar to the congeneric Pacific Angelshark (<em>Squatina californica</em>), which has a generation length of 23 years (Cailliet <em>et al. </em>1992).","The African Angelshark is caught in subsistence, artisanal, and industrial&#160;fisheries. <br/><br/>In South Africa, demersal trawling for prawns off the Thukela Banks, KZN overlapped with a potential nursery ground of this species (Fennessy 1994). For economic reasons this trawling has not been operational since 2010. However, similar trawling for the same target prawn species at the same depth range (&lt;50 m) occurs in Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar, thus if these areas also serve as nurseries for African Angelshark, juveniles occurring there will be caught. Deep-water trawling effort off KZN has declined, with only two vessels regularly operating. The species has been recorded as being occasionally taken by recreational shore anglers (Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975, ORI unpubl. data 2018). In the KZN shark control program shark nets, the species is caught in low  numbers with a significant proportion released alive (although  post-release mortality is unknown).<br/><br/>There are no catch data for the species in either the shallow-water or deep-water prawn trawl fisheries in Mozambique; trawl fishing effort has declined slightly for the shallow-water sector but has increased considerably in the deep-water sector in recent years.<br/><br/>Catches recorded on the Saya-de-Malha Bank (northeast of Madagascar) were from research trawls; the (then) USSR did develop some commercial fisheries there but the rapid depletion of resources resulted in their closure, with no known commercial trawl ventures since the late 1970s (E. Romanov CAP RUN, La Réunion, pers. comm. July 2017).<br/><br/>The African Angelshark is taken in the shallow-water prawn trawl fishery in Tanzania and Kenya (Narriman Jiddawi, Institute of Marine Sciences, Zanzibar, pers. comm. 2003). Tanzania closed its shallow-water prawn trawl fishery in 2008 (Silas 2011), but it re-opened in 2018. The species is also caught in deep-set gillnet fisheries in Tanzania (N. Jiddawi pers. comm. 2003). Although the Tanzanian deep-water crustacean fishery closed soon after 2006 (Kizska and Van der Elst 2015), a deep-water crustacean trawl fishery has recently commenced in Kenya. Kenyan shallow-water trawling effort has varied, with several closures. Several individuals have been caught in experimental shallow and deep-water trawls in Malindi-Ungwana Bay in central Kenya (e.g. Kimani <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kiilu and Ndegwa 2013).<br/><br/>In Somalia, there has been very little survey effort, but it is likely  that this species is taken by international fleets operating in Somali  waters and by artisanal fishermen.","In South Africa, the population is low and stable as indicated by catches in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shark nets and catches in the commercial fishery. Catches in the KZN shark control nets have averaged 25 individuals per annum, with approximately 10 individuals released per year for the period 1978-2017 (G. Cliff unpublished data 2017). There was no trend in the catch of this species in these nets from 1980-2017 (N. Nakabi unpublished data 2018; see the attached Supplementary Information). In the KZN shallow water (&lt;50 m) prawn trawl fishery on the Thukela Bank, 11 individuals were caught in 169 observed trawls from May 1989 to June 1992 when fishing was year-round. The fishery was subsequently closed from September to February inclusive. From 2003 to 2009, 52 individuals were caught in 235 observed trawls. On the deep (300-500 m) crustacean trawl grounds from 2003 to 2012, the species was recorded in 42 of 749 observed trawls (94 individuals). Catch rates were variable (0.01-0.45 individuals/trawl) and an estimated 700 individuals were caught per year in 2004 based on fishing effort at the time.<br/><br/>In Mozambique, during research surveys on the Dr Fridjtof Nansen, only one individual was recorded in 308 trawls from 1977 to 1983, although elasmobranchs may have been inconsistently recorded as the focus was on commercially important species; in 1990, 31 individuals were recorded in 4 of 256 observed trawls, and from 2007 to 2014, 19 individuals were recorded in 51 of 219 observed trawls. Depth range of trawls in which this species occurred ranged from 84-323 m (IMR unpubl. data 2018). The species' absence from shallower research trawls is puzzling and concerning.<br/><br/>In Madagascar, there were five individuals caught in three research trawls in 2009 (Alvheim <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>African Angelsharks were commonly caught in commercial deepwater trawls off Tanzania between 2003 and 2006, although this fishery is now closed (Kizska and Van der Elst 2015). In 2012, a deep-sea (&gt;200 m) exploratory survey was conducted off Tanzania and no individuals were encountered (TAFIRI unpubl. data 2018). <br/><br/>In Zanzibar, this species was reportedly the most common species of elasmobranch present in small-scale landings reported in fisher interviews in the mid-1990s, reported by 96% of fishers (Shehe and Jiddawi 1997). Later work examining small-scale landings in Zanzibar has not reported any individuals (Schaeffer 2004, Barrowclift <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>The species occurs in the shallow water prawn trawl grounds and in deep water off Kenya (Kimani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Aura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Kiilu and Ndegwa 2013).&#160;<br/>A recent year-long survey of 21 landings sites in Kenya, Zanzibar, and northern Madagascar did not record any individuals of this species (A. Temple unpubl. data 2018). <br/><br/>Due to reported declines in Zanzibar and the intensity of unregulated small-scale fisheries that are likely to catch the African Angelshark as bycatch across most of its range, it is suspected that this species has undergone a decline of at least 20-30% over three generation lengths (69 years). Although it has probably declined more in some parts of its range, the species does not appear to be declining in South Africa where fisheries management measures are in place, and it likely has some refuge there.<br/><br/>Due to reported declines in Zanzibar and the intensity of unregulated small-scale fisheries that are likely to catch the African Angelshark as bycatch across most of its range, it is suspected that this species has undergone a decline of at least 20-30% over three generation lengths (69 years).

Unpublished Soviet trawl data indicate this species' presence in the Gulf of Aden, and from the Saya-de Malha Bank northeast of Madagascar and partially within the EEZ of Mauritius (E.

The provenance of a recent record from a fish landing site in India (Ambily<em> et al.</em> 2018) is unclear. While this paper states that the specimen was caught off Lakshadweep, Indian fishing fleets range widely in the Western Indian Ocean (south to the Chagos Archipelago and west to Africa), and hence it seems more plausible that the individual was captured outside of the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone.","This species is likely taken and retained in artisanal, subsistence, and industrial fisheries.&#160; <br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>",Marine,"<p>Currently there are no species-specific conservation measures in place for the African Angelshark.

It is a highly prized species in a variety of fisheries, and was historically exploited by native Hawaiians. There is evidence of localised depletion in some areas and of a clear trend between human population and fish size, a proxy for fishing mortality. Recreational and commercial landings reported by the state are variable; however, the catch per unit effort of two fisheries (gill net and spear) have declined by about 33% over the past 10 years in the main Hawaiian Islands. Although about two-thirds of its distribution overlaps with marine protected and managed areas, this is in the northern part of its range, where its density is naturally low.&#160;Therefore, we infer that the population decline is less than, but approaching, the 30% threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion A2b.&#160;Therefore, this species is conservatively assessed as Near Threatened. Monitoring of harvest and population trends is recommended.","This species inhabits lagoon and seaward reefs, and occurs in small groups under ledges or among corals by day, dispersing at night to feed among rocks and corals on benthic crustaceans. Spawning appears to be year-round with the peak from December to July; females may spawn more than once a year (Randall 2004). &#160;The maximum reported length is 51 cm TL (Randall 2004) and maximum age is 6 years (Moffit 1979).

Recreational landings (in numbers harvested) were variable, and the declining trend was driven primarily by the first year of reported data, 2003 (NOAA 2016).

Overall, due to the estimated population  reductions along with the  uncertainty in the estimates, combined with the potential that some of  the estimated reduction could be due to a shift away from fishing grounds, and considering that there has been a reduction in trawl effort in South Africa in  recent decades, it  is suspected that the Yellowspotted Catshark has  undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three  generations (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation (bycatch), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Yellowspotted Catshark is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope  on soft and rocky substrates at depths of 26–695 m, although  it is most typically found over rocky reefs at 200–400 m depth, and deeper in warmer waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 112 cm total length (TL), males mature at 60 cm TL and females mature at 72 cm TL (Compagno <em>et al. </em>2004, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is oviparous, with egg cases laid in pairs, reproductive periodicity is unknown, and size-at-birth is 16 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).   Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is smaller than the Yellowspotted Catshark (48 cm vs 112 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 25 years for the Yellowspotted Catshark.","The Yellowspotted Catshark is a bycatch of trawl and line fisheries (da Silva<em> et al</em>. 2015). Trawl fishing effort in South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). It is reportedly common on trawl grounds (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013), although its habitat preference for rocky reefs may provide the Yellowspotted Catshark with some refuge from trawling. The species was reported as a minor bycatch of hake trawl research surveys in 2010 in Namibia (Kainge<em> et al. </em>2010). Some parts of southern Namibia are remote and may offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). There would be less refuge from the South African commercial line fishery targeting hake that commenced in 1998, as it can operate in rocky habitat and fishes at depths of 100–600 m (Petersen 2008). The Yellowspotted Catshark is discarded, and the post-release mortality is likely low, based on generally very low at-vessel and post-release mortality for catsharks (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). The species has been shown to move deeper, by about 4 m/year, within South Africa and Namibia over the period 1985–2010, under the influence of climate change warming effects on the Benguela Current (Yemane <em style="""">et al.</em> 2014).  This may affect the overlap of fisheries and the depth distribution of the  species, likely by providing the species with more refuge, although it is unknown if this shift represents a loss of habitat to the  species.","There are no estimates of population size for the Yellowspotted Catshark. Population trend data of annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 27 years in fished areas of South Africa during summer along the west coast (1991–2017) and autumn and spring along the south coast (1991–2016) by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (75 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/> <br/> The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 1.3% over the trawl grounds, consistent with a median reduction of 57.6% over the past three generation lengths (75<strong> </strong>years), with the highest probability (33.4%) of  &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths but also with a high probability (29.7%) of a 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. The 27 years of abundance data fluctuated greatly and led to a high degree of uncertainty in the modeled abundance index, and also required extrapolation to a long period of three generations (75 years). This combined to produce a probability distribution with contrasting probabilities of extinction risk.&#160;<br/><br/>Further to the above trend analysis, a study of fisheries-independent  surveys of the demersal longline and trawl fisheries targeting hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp.) off South Africa  reported that from 2000 to 2007, the biomass of Yellowspotted Catshark  declined by 44% on the west coast and by 50% on the south coast  (Petersen 2008). The observed declines in biomass begin a few years after commencement of the commercial hake longline fishery, although there were also changes in the survey gear during 2000–2007 that may confound the biomass trends (Petersen 2008), reducing the certainty in the estimated declines. Some of the estimated population reduction in both of the surveys is possibly a result of an increase in the depth range of the Yellowspotted Catshark associated with climate change (Yemane <em>et al. </em>2014) that may have moved some of its distribution away from the fishing grounds. There is no information on population trends for this  species in   Namibia, however, fishing pressure is suspected to be minimal in the   Namibia portion of this species' range.&#160;<br/><br/> Overall, due to the estimated population  reductions along with the uncertainty in the estimates, combined with the potential that some of the estimated reduction could be due to a shift away fishing grounds, and a reduction in trawl effort in South Africa in recent decades, it  is suspected that the Yellowspotted Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generations (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation (bycatch).",Decreasing,"The Yellowspotted Catshark is a southern African endemic occurring from the Karas Region of southern Namibia to Waterloo Bay, Eastern Cape, South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean (Soares and de Carvalho 2019).","The Yellowspotted Catshark has not been recorded in trade, and is not known to be utilized.",Marine,"There are currently no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this species. Recreational anglers in South Africa are restricted to one shark per species per day (maximum of 10 individuals per day) (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015), although enforcement is an ongoing issue. A number of protected areas occur within its range, including the West Coast National Park, South Africa. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates.","",,false,false,Global

No information is currently available on subpopulation trends in the southern Mediterranean Sea and northwestern coasts of Africa, although&#160;the Starry Smoothhound&#160;is also caught and landed there in relatively intensive coastal fisheries.&#160;Taken together this species is estimated to be increasing in the Northeast Atlantic <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">and inferred to have undergone a population reduction  of ~70% % of the past three generation lengths (39 years) in the  Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea.

In the Northeast Atlantic, this species is&#160;caught seasonally as bycatch in trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries, some of which discard or land the species, depending on market demands (ICES 2012). ICES landing statistics combine dogfish and smoothhounds together, so  there are little accurate data on Northeast Atlantic landings, and  levels of bycatch are largely unknown. There are areas of local abundance of the Starry Smoothhound throughout its range. Preliminary analyses of bycatch data indicate that juveniles are typically discarded, but no evaluation of discard survival rate has been undertaken (ICES 2012). Fishing mortality was estimated from the catch ratio from surveys of the Northeast Atlantic across the sub-adult and adult age classes (5–13 years). Since 1992, the fishing mortality has been variable, but overall has declined from 0.25 to 0.15. Nonetheless, the current level may still be slightly above the fishing mortality that produces maximum sustainable yield (F<sub>MSY</sub>&#160;= 0.11; Dureuil 2013).</p><p>This species may be landed for human consumption, and is used as bait for the inshore whelk fishery in England and Ireland. It is also an important sport angling fish in some areas, where most fish are returned to the sea, and often tagged. These areas include the Bristol and English Channels, the United Kingdom, the eastern and western Irish Sea, and off the coast of the Netherlands (ICES 2012).</p><p>In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a high level of exploitation on the continental shelf and upper slope to about 800 m depth (Massuti and Moranta 2003, Ferretti&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Smoothhounds<em>&#160;</em>are captured by demersal trawls, trammel nets, gillnets and longlines in this region (Bauchot 1987). Semi-industrial fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, off Sicily, Spain, and Cyprus are known to take these species, and also artisanal fisheries elsewhere. Smoothhounds<em>&#160;</em>are retained and used in the Mediterranean Sea, where they are regularly sold for human consumption in many areas (Fischer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1987).</p>","<p>Although species-specific data are limited, data for all smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus</em>&#160;spp.) provides a good proxy for trends in landings and relative abundance of this species.<strong>&#160;</strong>The Starry Smoothhound occurs in three regions<a>: the&#160;</a>Northeast Atlantic,&#160;the Mediterranean Sea&#160;and Black Sea, and northwest Africa<strong>.</strong>&#160;The Mediterranean Sea is considered a separate stock from the Atlantic based on differences in reproductive biology, which limits potential for external recruitment in the event of population depletion.<strong></strong></p><p>First, in the Northeast Atlantic, the&#160;Starry Smoothhound is the most frequently encountered smoothhound species (ICES 2013). In the Bay of Biscay,&#160;landings have increased markedly from 151 to 499 t from 1996 to 2004, and have remained stable in Portuguese waters since an initial peak in 1999 (ICES 2007). Fishery independent surveys of the Celtic Seas, southern North Sea, English Channel, and Irish Sea all suggest increasing trends in nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) (ICES 2010, 2013). For example, a fishery independent survey in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea also found an increase in CPUE from about 0.1–0.3 individuals per hour in the early to mid-1990s to around 1.0–1.3 individuals per hour in 2009–2011. Martin&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the mean density of Starry Smoothhound more than doubled between 1988 and 2008 throughout the English Channel. Similar trends were reported from various trawl surveys in the Northeast Atlantic between 1992 and 2012, where the highest increase in abundance was observed in French surveys (Dureuil 2013).</p><p>A relative abundance survey conducted by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in the Celtic Sea recorded a peak in 2000 and again in 2004 over a 17-year time series, although the year 2000 peak was not found in a concurrent French survey (ICES 2007). Nonetheless, a United Kingdom beam trawl survey also found an increase in smoothhound relative abundance and frequency of occurrence (ICES 2011). The trend of the population in the Northeast Atlantic is therefore of an increase.&#160;Based on these increases in abundance the&#160;Starry Smoothhound&#160;is estimated to be increasing and of Least Concern in the Northeast Atlantic. <span lang=""EN-US"">However, there has been a corresponding increase in  reported landings from this region, and given the absence of effective  species-specific management for this subpopulation, abundance trends and  catch volumes must be carefully monitored.</p><p>Second, in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, the Starry Smoothhound&#160;is less common than&#160;the&#160;Common Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus mustelus</em>), although the potential for misidentification should be noted. In the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS)&#160;showed a very low&#160;frequency of occurrence, with this smoothhound recorded in only five of 6,336 hauls conducted from 1994 to 1999 at 10–800 m depth (Baino&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). The occurrence of this species also decreased in trawl surveys conducted in 1948 and 1998 in the Adriatic Sea (Jukic-Peladic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). Aldebert (1997) reported&#160;a clear decrease in abundance of smoothhounds&#160;(<em>Mustelus</em>&#160;sp.) in comparable surveys in the Gulf of Lions, southern France, from 1970 to 1995. In Hvar trawl surveys conducted in 1948 in the Adriatic Sea, occurrence of&#160;the Starry Smoothhound&#160;was about 1.0 (frequency log-transformed), compared to about 0.1 in comparable MEDITS surveys conducted in the same area in 1998, which shows a decline of 90% from 1948 to 1998.&#160;<a>A population reduction of ~70% is inferred for the three generation length of&#160;</a>39&#160;years. Most recently, between 2006 and 2008, Fortuna&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011) examined trawl fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, and found that this species was rarely caught as bycatch, with a catch rate of 0.0048 individuals per haul. In 2009,&#160;two specimens were caught in the southwestern Black Sea (Eryılmaz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p><a>Catch data&#160;</a>should be examined with caution as the catches reported as smoothhounds often consist of an aggregation of small-sized demersal sharks. Data reported to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations show that smoothhound landings steadily increased between 1950 and 1978 to 14,000 t, after which they fluctuated between about 6,500 and 14,000 t from 1978 to 1994 (FAO 2008). After 1994, landings dropped significantly to 2,980 t in 1997 and did not exceed 2,200 t from 2001 to 2006 (FAO 2008). It is likely that this species has never been very abundant in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the available information on landings (although not species-specific) combined with the more detailed information derived from fishery-independent trawl surveys, suggest that this particular species has declined in abundance in the Mediterranean Sea. In some cases, as in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea, this species can be considered locally extinct due to overfishing (Ferretti&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Ferretti&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>Third, little is known of the status in the Western Central Atlantic, but status along the&#160;continental shelf of Morocco and Mauritania is likely to be similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. There may be refuge for a small population in the Canary Islands as trawling was banned there in 1980 (Lawson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;</p><p>Taken together this species is estimated to be increasing in the Northeast Atlantic and inferred to have undergone a population reduction of ~70% % of the past three generation lengths (39 years) in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Due to similarly high fishing pressure along the continental shelves of the Eastern Central Atlantic it is suspected that this species has also undergone a similar level of population reduction. Assuming the Northeast Atlantic region comprises two-thirds of the range of Starry Smoothhound it is suspected that overall this species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and&#160;this species is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2d.<br/></p>",Decreasing,<p>The Starry Smoothhound is found in the&#160;<a>Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (but absent from the Black Sea)</a>&#160;from Scotland and southern Norway down to Western Sahara and the Canary Islands&#160;<a>(Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</a></p>,"<p>The&#160;Starry Smoothhound&#160;is commercially valuable in the Mediterranean Sea&#160;and northwestern Africa, where the meat is utilized fresh, frozen, or salted and dried for human consumption. It is regularly present on the Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, Tunisian and Turkish markets; and sold fresh, frozen, refrigerated or salted-dried (Fischer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1987).&#160;It is often discarded by commercial fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic, but the species is important for recreational fisheries in some areas of this region.</p>",Marine,"<p>In the Northeast Atlantic, there is currently no restriction on catch of this species. Based on its approach to data-limited stocks, ICES advised in 2012 that 2013–2014 catches should be reduced by 4%. Despite this advice and commitments to manage commercial fisheries, there are currently no European Union limits on landings or proposals for management.</p><p>The European Community Council Regulations 850/98 for the ‘conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms’ details the minimum mesh sizes that can be used to target fish. Smoothhounds would be classed under ‘all other marine organisms’ and so can only be targeted in fixed nets of more than 220 millimeters (ICES 2012).</p><p>In the Mediterranean Sea, there is currently no restriction on catch. Species-specific management measures are necessary to prevent further declines in this region, including improved data collection to species level for commercial landings.&#160;The Starry Smoothhound&#160;is listed in Appendix III of the Barcelona Convention, which suggests it should be afforded regulations regarding exploitation in the Mediterranean Sea (Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1). The listing directs the recording and reporting to national authorities of all encounters with the species (including catch, bycatch, and discard) and encourages improved data collection and scientific monitoring.&#160;However, compliance with this directive has been poor, and thus Mediterranean data on this species remains seriously lacking. The Balearic Island Marine Reserves offer minimal protection to smoothhounds, as they<em>&#160;</em>are protected within the waters of the reserve. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>","",,false,false,Global
124414963,41730,Atelomycterus marmoratus,Near Threatened,A2cd,2021,2020-05-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Coral Catshark (<em>Atelomycterus marmoratus</em>) is a small (to 70 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Eastern and Western Indian, Western Central Pacific, and Northwest Pacific Oceans from Pakistan to China. It inhabits shallow rocky and coral reef habitats at depths of 5–100 m.<br/><br/>The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption. Reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones can be used to infer population reductions of 54–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). Further, a population reduction of 60% was inferred based on a 50% decrease in fisheries-independent research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs (all species combined) between 1978–80 and 2013 in Myanmar. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of elasmobranchs in the region.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is high across much of the spatial and depth range of this species, yet it is still commonly landed in parts of its range. The relative proportion of this species in shark landings has increased over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of the Coral Catshark. Alternatively, the increase in landings may imply some resilience to, or refuge from, fishing pressure. This species spends much of its time on coral and rocky habitats where many fishing gears are unlikely to be deployed. The rocky and coral habitat and inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species refuge from fishing pressure over the majority of its range.<br/><br/>This species is not targeted in any part of its range and if landed is likely as done so as bycatch. It is likely that this species has not declined to the same degree as other sharks and rays in the region. It is suspected that the Coral Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the last three generation lengths (45 years) due to declines in habitat quality and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2cd).","The Coral Catshark is found on complex coral and rocky reefs at depths of 5–100 m (Weigmann 2016). This species reaches a length of at least 70 cm total length (TL) (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013) with males maturing at 47–62 cm TL and females maturing at 49–57 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is oviparous with size-at-birth is reported to be 10–13 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013). Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2011). The Coral Catshark has a similar longevity (~20 years in captivity, Hövel et al. 2010) as the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark and thus, the generation length is inferred as 15 years for the Coral Catshark.","The Coral Catshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is regularly taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet and line, and retained for human consumption (SEAFDEC 2016, Psomadakis et al. 2019). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>India has an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters throughout the Bay of Bengal (&gt;23,000; K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across Southeast Asia (Karnad et al. 2019). There is a high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020a). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen et al. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that has been increasing in recent decades with 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in 2017–2018 (DoF 2018, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal fishing fleet operates at depths of 0–40 m on average but can operate down to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 t in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014). Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). A 165% increase in fishers occurred from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise a high majority (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Coral Catshark. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020b). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-orientated economy (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020b).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Coral Catshark is likely to have some refuge from the majority of fishing activity throughout its range. This species spends much of its time on coral and rocky habitats where many fishing gears are unlikely to be deployed. This species is not targeted in any part of its range and if landed is likely as done so as bycatch.<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the South China Sea, there has been degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat in the last 70 years (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs, which this species relies on heavily (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995, FAO 2020b). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).","There is no species-specific trend information available for the Coral Catshark. Surveys of landing sites indicate that the Coral Catshark makes up nearly 9% of shark catch by number and 0.6% of shark catch by weight which is an increase since 2006 (SEAFDEC 2006, 2016). This increase may be due to declines in large sharks and increased targeting and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Bangladesh, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. <br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, this species is considered uncommon, likely due to the lack of available habitat in the region (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline in catch over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 then declined to the 3,500 t in the mid 1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, reconstructed catch data, from 1950 to the late 1990s, varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014). Trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel ""Dr Fridtjof Nansen"" showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs over the 33 years between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013 and a shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014). Market surveys reveal a decline in landings of 49% over a four-year period (2006–2010) despite no reduction in fishing effort and increasing domination by small, short-lived species (San San Khine 2010).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, landings data collected ﻿from six fishing ports across Peninsular and East Malaysia during October 2014–July 2017 recorded 122 individuals representing 2% of total catch for that period (Arai and Azri 2019). More recently, landings data collected across eight landing sites in Sarawak state from October 2017 – June 2019 recorded three individuals (one in 2017, two in 2018), representing 0.4% of total recorded catch for that period (WCS Malaysia unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, reconstructed shark and ray catches declined by 30% on the east coast of Malaysia from 1999 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Similarly, on the west coast of Malaysia, reconstructed catches declined by 18% over the same period. These declines can be inferred to represent shark and ray population reductions, as fishing effort was increasing during the period of declines in catch (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Gulf of Thailand, reconstructed shark and ray catch showed a 74% decline over 12 years from 2003 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Historically, catches fluctuated since 1950–1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, landings data collected in Lombok from 2014-2015 indicated that 10 individuals of this species were caught by surface and bottom longlines in 2014 (0.1% of total catch from Jan 2014 – Dec 2015), but no others have been recorded since 2014 (Yulianto et al. 2018, WCS Indonesia unpubl. data 2020), while landings data collected in East Java from August 2017–March 2018 recorded seven individuals, making up 0.4% of total catch for that period (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Indonesia, net and trawl fisheries (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are limited, declines of the Coral Catshark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). This species is considered common in the area and is not targeted in Indonesia (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, reconstructed shark and ray catches declined 84% from 1993 to 2016 (Pauley et al. 2020). Historically, catches of sharks and rays increased from 647 t in 1950 to 8,510 t in 1975 then declined to 2,561 t in 1990. Catches then rose steeply to a peak of 12,980 t in 1993 before declining to 2.132 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; These declines can be inferred to represent shark and ray population reductions, as fishing effort was increasing during the period of declines in catch (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed shark and ray catch declined by 97% over 29 years from 1986 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in catch (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In China, reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>When these reconstructed catches are scaled to three generation lengths of the Coral Catshark (45 years), they represent declines of 74%, 55%, 99%, 97%, and 54% in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines, Viet Nam, and China respectively. In Myanmar, a population reduction of 60% was inferred based on a 50% decrease in research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.&#160; The relative proportion of the Coral Catshark in shark landings has increased over recent decades in the Indo-Malay region and this species may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks. The species is considered common in Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Indonesia but is uncommon in the Indian Ocean (L. Seyha unpubl. data 2020, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species likely has some refuge from fishing activity in rocky and coral reef habitats throughout its range. Because this species is increasing in landings and is still considered common in many parts of its range, it is suspected that it has not declined to the same degree as other sharks and rays in the region. Overall, it is suspected that the Coral Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the last three generation lengths (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Coral Catshark occurs in the Western and Eastern Indian, Western Central and Northwest Pacific Oceans from Pakistan to southern China, including New Guinea and the Philippines (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, Arai and Azri 2019).","This species is retained, if caught, and the meat is consumed and traded locally with a value of USD $0.81 per kg (Thailand; SEAFDEC 2006). This species is also targeted and bred for the aquaria trade (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures currently in place. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 02/04/2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnes are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Coral Catshark, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

This represents a steep decline of 82% over 4 years, although there was a decline in commercial fisheries effort over that period and without concurrent effort data it is not possible to determine how  much of the decline represents an actual decline in abundance. Effort has since stabilized, but there have been no observers on board since 2011 and hence catch rates in that fishery are currently unknown (S. Fennessy, unpubl. data, 2018). This species was not recorded in research trawl surveys off Madagascar  (<em>RV Dr Fridjtof Nansen </em>surveys in 1983, 2008, and 2009), nor off Tanzania (surveys  in 1982, 1983, and 2018), and one specimen was recorded off Mozambique (surveys from 1977 to 2018) but  this lack of records may be partly due to Balloon Shark's preference for rocky habitats  which is not habitat suitable for trawl gear (S. Fennessy, unpubl. data,&#160; 2018).<br/><br/>Two congeners heavily fished by trawls in southeast Australia exhibited contrasting responses to fishing pressure: the Whitefin Swellshark (<em>Cephaloscyllium albipinnum</em>) had steep  population declines of 75% over 12 years, while the Australian Swellshark (<em>C. laticeps</em>), a commonly caught bycatch, showed no decline in abundance over the same period (Walker and Gason 2007). The Australian Swellshark has low discard mortality as it is extremely resilient to capture and handling out of water (Frick <em>et al.</em> 2009). The Balloon Shark's response to fishing pressure cannot be surmised from congeners, as it appears to be highly variable.<br/><br/>Overall, a steep decline in commercial catches of the Balloon Shark is inferred, and fisheries operate across much of its range, yet the species likely has refuge in a number of marine parks across its range, in rocky habitats, and in deeper waters. The Balloon Shark is therefore suspected to have undergone a population reduction of  20–29% over the past three  generation lengths (75 years) due to actual  levels of  exploitation (bycatch).",Decreasing,"The Balloon Shark occurs in the Western Indian Ocean from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to Mozambique, as well as in Southwest Madagascar, and Comoros (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2018, D.

The species is likely a bycatch of&#160;deep-water demersal trawl fisheries that operate across its entire range, and although effort has substantially declined in some of the deep-water fisheries since 2007, some fishing effort remains. Overall, due to past and ongoing (albeit reduced) fishing pressure across its entire range, it is suspected that the Blackspot Skate&#160;has    undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three    generation lengths (21 years), and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Blackspot Skate is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 137–403 m (Compagno and Ebert 2007, Weigmann 2016).

Reproduction is oviparous, with the number of egg cases, reproductive periodicity, and size-at-birth unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown and are inferred from a skate of similar size and depth range, the White-spotted Skate (<em>Dentiraja cerva</em>), that has a female age-at-maturity of 5 years and maximum age of 9 years (Treloar 2009); generation length is therefore inferred as 7 years for the Blackspot Skate.","Although there is a lack of available information, the Blackspot Skate is suspected to be a bycatch of&#160;deep-water demersal trawl fisheries due to the overlap with its range. A crustacean trawl fishery operates off Durban, and extends northwards into southern Mozambique. This deep-water fishery operates on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 100–600 m (Fennessy and Groenveld 1997). Effort, however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time, for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 24 April 2018). Other trawl fishing in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013) is also suspected to catch this species.","There are no estimates of population size or trend for the Blackspot Skate. The species is known from seven localities recorded by demersal research trawl surveys from 1985 to 1996 (Compagno and Ebert 2007).  This species' entire range overlaps with trawl fisheries, and although deep-water trawl fishing effort has substantially declined in some sectors since 2007, the species is still exposed to some deep-water trawl effort.

Fishery-independent surveys on the New South Wales (Australia) upper slope between 1976–77 and 1996–97 documented significant declines in catch rate (the equivalent of &gt;99.9% over the last three generations) as a result of intensive trawl fishing on the narrow continental slope. More recently, however, standardized catch-per-unit-effort exhibited no trend for Ogilby’s Chimaera between 1994–2006 suggesting that the population may have stabilized at low levels due to changes in fisheries management. This region is estimated to represent ~10% of the species' known global range. Elsewhere in its wide Australian range,&#160;fishing pressure on the upper slope is generally low, and the population reduction recorded in the southeast is not considered representative of the whole Australian range of the species.

Female maturity is unknown, however mature females have been reported at 72 cm TL (without filament; Kyne 2008, C. Rigby unpubl. data). Size-at-birth is ~14 cm TL (White <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Within the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), Ogilby's Chimaera is considered to have a high catch susceptibility to otter trawl, a medium catch susceptibility to auto hook gear, and a low susceptibility to shark gillnet, shark hook, and trap/pot gear (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Some fisheries operating with the species' range have low effort, particularly the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDWTF) and the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2019). An Ecological Risk Assessment of the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector (GABTS) of the SESSF identified Ogilby's Chimaera as at low risk in the fishery (AFMA 2008).&#160;Improved information on the catches of Ogilby's Chimaera in the GABTS should be available in the future as the 2014–2016 Bycatch and Discarding Working Plan for this fishery states that Integrated Scientific Monitoring Program is to include reporting of chondrichthyan catches at species level to enable a time-series of catch to be constructed (AFMA 2014).</p>  <p>Observer and fishery-independent surveys have shown the species to be a bycatch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (deep-water component of the eastern king prawn sector). This sector does not generally operate beyond 200 m depth and so is at the upper limit of the depth range of Ogilby's Chimaera, although when caught the mortality rate was high (Kyne 2008, C. Rigby, unpubl. data). Outside of this fishery, there is very little other fishing pressure over the species' geographical and bathymetrical depth range off Queensland. Off Western Australia, fishing effort is low, with only a few boats operating in the NWSTF and the WDTF (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160; &#160;</p>  <p>In eastern Indonesia, the expansion of deep-water fisheries in the region is underway, and Indonesian deep-water fisheries operate throughout much of the depth range at which this species occurs. Ogilby’s Chimaera is often caught in demersal longline fisheries in parts of Indonesia (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).

Catches declined from a mean catch rate of 8.3 kg/hour to 0.3 kg/hour in the 20-year period, equating to a decline of &gt;99.9% over three generations (~56 years). Reductions are even more striking when data are broken down into regions, with the mean catch rate off Eden-Gabo Island (northern NSW/southern Victoria) declining from 17.4 kg/hour in 1976–77 to &lt;0.1 kg/hour in 1996–97, equating to a decline of &gt;99.9% over three generations (~56 years).&#160;The relatively narrow continental slope off northern/central NSW, including most of the depth range of Ogilby’s Chimaera, is intensively fished and there is continued pressure in this area.&#160;More recently, however, standardized catch-per-unit-effort by depth exhibited no trend for Ogilby’s Chimaera between 1994–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).

It inhabits shallow coastal inshore and coral reef habitats to a depth of 50 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. It is subject to intense and largely unmanaged fisheries across its range and is landed and utilized for food (although it is of low value) often in high numbers. <br/><br/>Fishing pressure is intense across the range of this species, yet it is still commonly landed in parts of its range; it is the most abundantly caught shark in parts of Taiwan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. There is no long-term trend data on the populations; general   long-term shark population trends have shown declines of 37–99% over the   past three generation lengths (27 years). The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of this species. It is a relatively productive  species and has  not declined to the extent that  other species have in the region. It is suspected that the Whitespotted Bambooshark has undergone a  population reduction of 20–29% over the last three generation lengths  (27 years) based on actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Whitespotted Bambooshark occurs in shallow coastal inshore coral reef habitats; it is nocturnal, resting by day in reef crevices (Compagno 2001). This species reaches a maximum size of 95 cm total length (TL); males mature at 50–60 cm TL and females mature at 65 cm TL (Compagno 2001, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Reproduction is oviparous, with information on reproduction only available from captivity (Masuda and Teshima 1994, Miki 1994, Masuda 1998). The maximum laying season reported by Miki (1994) of 87 days yielded 26 eggs from one individual, 11 of which failed to develop. Size-at-birth was reported as 9.8 cm TL by Compagno (2001) but an average of 16.6 cm TL in captivity (Miki 1994, Masuda 1998). In the wild, age-at-maturity is 4.5 years, longevity is estimated at 12.6–14.2&#160;years (Chen <em>et al. </em>2007), and generation length is estimated at 9 years. This species has been reported to live to 25 years old in captivity (Michael 1993).","<p>The majority of the distribution of the Whitespotted Bamboo Shark is under substantial, generally unregulated and unmanaged fishing pressure. The species is taken regularly by demersal inshore trawl and gillnet fisheries and despite its low value, is landed and utilised (Compagno 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). It has little refuge from exploitative activities as it has a relatively narrow inshore occurrence, except potentially for some more remote areas of the Indo-Malay Archipelago. Fishing effort and power is continuing to increase in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013) which will continue to place pressure on inshore species.</p>  <p>India has&#160;an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters (&gt;23,000; K.K.

In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal areas on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005). </p>  <p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that has been increasing in recent decades with 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in 2017–2018 (DoF 2018, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal fishing fleet operates at depths of 0–40 m on average but can operate down to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>  </p><p>Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). <a name=""_Hlk46146531"">The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014</a>.

Species-specific landings monitoring from 2014–2017 in Peninsular Malaysia (4 sites), Sarawak (1 site) and Sabah (1 site) suggests that this species makes up ~8% of total elasmobranch catches from the South China Sea (Arai and Azri 2019). However, more recent data collected in Sarawak state alone for 2017–2019 suggests this species is now landed rarely, despite significant catches of other elasmobranchs (H.

It has been among the top shark fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). This species is the most abundant shark in the Indonesian aquarium trade (Fahmi unpupl. data 2020), though species-specific landings data from Lombok and Aceh indicate suggest the species is landed infrequently, despite relatively large landings of Grey Carpetshark (<em>C. punctatum</em>)<em> </em>and other bamboo sharks (Yulianto&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018, H.

Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore and occur across all habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, and estuaries. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and  are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate  enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em>  2014b, FAO 2020b). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since  the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam  moved towards a market-orientated economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b). The fleet  is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that  have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884618"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished. </a>The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H.

In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since  the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries  during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly  2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from  ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an  increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the  catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased  and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less  valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture  (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012).&#160; </p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and&#160;cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1995, FAO 2020b).</p>","<p>The Whitespotted Bambooshark is an abundant inshore species. It is reported as the most abundant shark captured in north and west Taiwan, though no species-specific trend data is available (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b). It is one of the dominant shark species landed in Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). In Sabah, Malaysia, this species is one of the most abundantly caught sharks (B.M. Manjaji Matsumoto unpubl. data 2020). While in Sarawak, Malaysia, this species is sometimes recorded in domestic fish markets, though rarely recorded at landing sites (H. Booth pers. comm. 25th August 2020). This species is thought to account for ~8% of total landings, based on catches from Malaysian vessels in the South China Sea (data collection from 4 sites in Peninsular Malaysia, 1 site in Sabah and 1 site in Sarawak)&#160; (Arai and Azri 2019).</p><p>Monitoring of fish landing sites in Southeast Asia have shown that the relative proportion of Whitespotted Bambooshark in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades due to declines in large sharks and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and&#160;Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Lack and Sant 2012, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). This general trend has been seen across fish stocks across the region where smaller-sized fish are being landed as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (e.g. China; Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, catches of all sharks combined are available for the Gulf of Thailand and reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates are available from 1950 to 2014 for the Bangladesh, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In the Gulf of Thailand, landings data of all sharks showed a 96% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 9,005 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~400 t in 2014 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003–2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. </p><p>In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 then declined to 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).   In Cambodia, the reconstructed catch data showed a 91% reduction over 12  years from 2003 to 2014. Catches sharply rose from 1950 to a peak of 4,550  t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak  catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t  in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings of  sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a  decline in landings (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014a, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).  In Viet Nam, reconstructed shark and ray catch declined by 97% over 29 years from 1986 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to  ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply  during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a  fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).  These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during  the period of a decline in catch (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). In  China, reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the  early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).  Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s  and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government  since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore  fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and  Liang 2019). </p><p>When these reconstructed catch declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Whitespotted Bambooshark (27 years) they represent declines of 56%, 99%, 96%, and 37% in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and China respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Elsewhere, in Malaysia, the relative proportion of bamboosharks (<em>Chiloscyllium</em> spp.) in landings has doubled over recent years (Arshad <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Lack and Sant 2012, SEAFDEC 2016). In Indonesia, net and trawl fisheries (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<strong> </strong>In Taiwan, although this is reported as the most abundantly caught shark in 2013 (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013b), the landings of small demersal sharks declined by 80% over a 10-year period from 1993 to 2003 (Chen<em> et al.</em> 2007). The long-term declines in small demersal shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.</p>  The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region and the Whitespotted Bambooshark may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks (B.M. Manjaji Matsumoto&#160;and S. Fowler unpubl. data 2020). However, the fishing pressure across its range is intense and general  long-term shark population trends have shown declines of 37–99% over the  past three generation lengths (27 years). This species is still very abundant in many parts of its range; it is a relatively productive species, therefore it has  not declined to the extent that other species have in the region. Overall, it is suspected that the Whitespotted Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) based on actual levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Whitespotted Bambooshark has a broad distribution in the Indo-West Pacific ranging from southern India to southern Japan including the Indo-Malay Archipelago and Papua New Guinea (Manjaji 2002, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a, White <em>et al. </em>2017). Its presence in Myanmar is uncertain (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013a). References to the species in the southwest Indian Ocean refer to the Bluespotted Bambooshark (<em>Chiloscyllium caeruleopunctatum</em>).","The Whitespotted Bambooshark is landed and widely utilized across its range for its meat or as fish meal, although it is of low-value due its small size (White<em> et al.</em> 2006, Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). This species is valued at roughly USD $2/kg in Malaysia but may fetch a greater value when sold as 'fish fillets' in wet markets (H. Booth pers comm 7th October 2020,&#160;B.M. Manjaji Matsumoto unpubl. data 2020). This species is also sold live in seafood restaurants in the 'Live Reef Fish Food Trade' (B.M. Manjaji Matsumoto unpubl. data 2020). It is a popular aquarium species (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Fins of the genus <em>Chiloscyllium </em>have been reported in the Hong Kong fin trade, though they represented a small percentage of total samples (Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018)",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures currently in place. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 GT (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al. </em>2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East and South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Whitespotted Bambooshark, and catch rates should be monitored.    </p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 328–790 m. The Atlantic Sawtail Catshark is infrequently reported as bycatch across its range in demersal trawl fisheries and longline fisheries but is likely to be confused with the related Blackmouth Catshark (<em>G. melastomus</em>). Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that reach the depth limit of the species. In the Northeast Atlantic, there are various management actions that apply to listed deep-water sharks, including a prohibited on targeted fisheries, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for shark bycatch in longline fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp), and depth limits beyond which gillnets and demersal trawl fisheries are prohibited in some areas. Overall, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, increasing trends in the Mediterranean, and some species-specific management across part of its range. The Atlantic Sawtail Catshark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) based on abundance indices and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).<br/><p></p>","The Atlantic Sawtail Catshark is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 328–790 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 46 cm total length (TL)&#160;(Weigmann 2016).&#160;Males mature at 33–42 cm TL and females mature at 37–45 cm TL (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). Reproduction is oviparious and one female was found with nine egg cases (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species, the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 9.1 years and a maximum age of 20.9 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011).","The Atlantic Sawtail Catshark is infrequently reported as bycatch in demersal trawl and trammel net fisheries (Moura <em>et al. </em>2018, González-García<em> et al.</em> 2020). It is likely to be misidentified with the related Blackmouth Catshark&#160;(<em>G. melastomus</em>) and is more common than previously known.&#160;<br/><br/>The Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean have been subject to extensive and intensive deep-water fishing across the entirety of the species' known depth and spatial distribution (Coelho&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). In the Northeast Atlantic, there were a number of demersal trawl and longline fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope (Gordon 1999, ICES-WGEF 2019). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured occasionally in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Off the southern coast of Portugal, the species has been regularly captured by deep-water longline fisheries targeting&#160;wreck fish (<em style="""">Polyprion americanus</em>) and conger eels (<em style="""">Conger conger</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries.&#160;Under SFPAs, demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) and scabbardfish   (<em>Aphanopu</em>s&#160;spp). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at 100–400 m (Cervantes<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160; <strong><br/></strong>","Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of the Atlantic Sawtail Catshark, and the species is often misidentified as the related Blackmouth Catshark&#160;(<em>G. melastomus</em>). Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Mediterranean (Ramírez-Amaro<em> et al. </em>2020). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (45 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherly<em> et al.</em> 2020, Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of the relative abundance estimates from&#160;the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS; 2000–2015) in the Northern Alboran Sea (Spain) revealed an annual rate of increase of 7.6%, consistent with no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (45 years). While many chondrichthyans have exhibited population reduction in the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Sawtail Catshark was one of two species where stability was observed in both density and standardized biomass since the early 1990s&#160;(Ramírez-Amaro<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>Off western&#160;Morocco, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates data showed a&#160;22% decline in landings from 1997 to 2016.&#160;Historically, landings&#160;increased&#160;from&#160;7,192&#160;t in 1950 to 14,553 t in 1969, fluctuated thereafter and further increased to a peak of 37,629 t in 1997 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In 2016, landings were estimated at 29,189 t (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Declines in landings can be inferred to represent population reductions as fishing effort increased substantially during this time (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This represents a 45% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (45 years) of the Atlantic Sawtail Catshark. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in Morocco.<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Atlantic Sawtail Catshark was estimated to have increased in the Mediterranean and suspected to have declined in the Eastern Central Atlantic. With high levels of exploitation across its known range, a global population reduction of 20–29% is suspected over three generation lengths (45 years). Therefore, the Atlantic Sawtail Catshark&#160;is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).<strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></strong>",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Sawtail Catshark is found in the Northeastern and Central Atlantic Oceans (from Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, possibly to Mauritania) and the Mediterranean Sea around the Straits of Gibraltar (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).",The species is not known to be utilized and is likely discarded when captured (Ebert and Stehamann 2013).,Marine,"In 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2019).

It is the most abundant round ray in small-scale shrimp trawling in Colombia and is also abundant in the bycatch of the Costa Rican industrial shrimp trawl fishery. It is generally discarded although round rays may be used as bait or fishmeal by artisanal fishers.

In El Salvador, catches in the industrial trawl fishery are in low numbers (Fuentes&#160;and&#160;Hernández&#160;2004). Within the Gulf of Panama there are fisheries for small pelagic fishes (anchovies, herrings etc.) that operate on soft-benthic coastal habitats and which take this species as bycatch (CeDePesca 2016).<br/><br/>Overall, there is high spatial overlap with fisheries (which generally lack management or effective enforcement of regulations across most of its range), and given the geographic and depth range of the species, it has no refuge from fishing activities that operate across its range.

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 45–400 m. The species is likely a bycatch of demersal trawl and longline and is retained in Taiwan, and possibly South Korea and the Philippines, for human consumption and fish meal, and is variously retained and discarded in parts of Japan. There are no species-specific population trend data. It is considered to be a rare species, and it is infrequently captured in Japan and Taiwan, rare in South Korea, and not reported from fisheries in the Philippines. Medium to large <em>Dipturus</em> species are susceptible to overfishing due to their relatively low biological productivity, which is of concern for the Acutenose Skate. However, this species has refuge from fishing pressure at depth across some of its range and although historic fishing pressure was high, the fishing pressure has declined across some of its range over the past 30 years. It is suspected that the Acutenose Skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Acutenose Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope on sandy and muddy substrates at depths of 45–400 m (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016).

Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from two similar-sized deep-water skates; the Yellownose Skate (<em>D. chilensis</em>) at 128-158 cm TL and Sharpnose Skate (<em>D. oxyrinchus</em>) at 100 cm TL, which have female ages-at-maturity of 14 years and 8 years and maximum ages of 21 years and 9 years, resulting in generation lengths of 17.5 years and 8.5 years, respectively (Licandeo <em>et al.</em> 2006, Yigin and Ismen 2010). Thus, the generation length of the Acutenose Skate is inferred as 13 years.","The Acutenose Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial range. It is a rare and infrequent bycatch from deep-water demersal trawl and longline fisheries and retained for human consumption or fish meal in Taiwan, and possibly South Korea and the Philippines. It is discarded in Japanese waters of the East China Sea but is retained in the Tohoku region (ex Aomori Prefecture) (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). In Japan, this species is occasionally recorded and may be captured by demersal trawl fisheries that operate at depths of 200–800 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). It may also be captured by a deepwater dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>  In South Korea, it may be captured in trawl and longline fisheries. Fishing effort in South Korea increased markedly in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean Exclusive Economic Zone (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon<em> et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/> In Taiwan, the species is often confused with the Giant Skate (<em>D. gigas</em>) which is observed infrequently at Da-xi fish market in the northeast (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is presumed to be taken as bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off the northeast coast of Taiwan at depths of 200–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D.A.

The time-series reveals a phase of steep decline until 1992, thereafter the population index increased in a manner very similar to the increasing abundance estimated off the Grand Banks (3LNOPs) during the same time period.

Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span>","<span style="""">There are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013,&#160;Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018).<br/></span><br/><span style="""">First, in the Mediterranean Sea, surveys indicate that the Round Stingray is generally uncommon and mostly recorded along&#160;the&#160;North African coast (Serena <em>et al. </em>2020). A single record is reported from the northwest area where, in 1997, two individuals were captured in a trammel net off&#160;the coast of Livorno in Italy (Serena <em>et al. </em>1999). One individual has been reported from a trawl survey in 1997 in Iskanderun Bay, Turkey (Başusta&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1998). Off the Syrian coast, three&#160;individuals were caught in 2012 using&#160;bottom longlines (two individuals) and trawl (one individual) gear (Ali <em>et al.</em> 2013). Little information is&#160;available on abundance, but this species is also listed on national fisheries checklists in Israel, Egypt, and Tunisia (where it appears to be the most common) (El Sayed 1994, Bradai <em>et al.</em> 2004,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Golani 2005</span><span style="""">). In the Azores, i</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">t is considered common based on data from experimental fishing surveys and underwater visual surveys (Das and Afonso 2017).<br/></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/></span><span style="""">Second, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;</span><p><span style="""">Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">.&#160;Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107&#160;t/kW&#160;in 1981–1983 to 0.060&#160;t/kW&#160;in 2013–2015.</span></span></p><p></p><p><span style="""">Third, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that while there are limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, it is still landed across most of this portion of its range.&#160;This species&#160;has rarely been reported in regular monitoring of fisheries landings between 2006–2018 undertaken by the&#160;Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin with five individuals recorded in 2012 and one in 2020 (M. Dia&#160;unpubl. data 2020). It&#160;has however been recorded in experimental trawl fishing surveys between 1988–2007, although quantities are not available (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020).&#160;During extensive landing site surveys across&#160;the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004–2011, this species was only recorded in Cape Verde (Diop and Dossa 2011). In&#160;Cape Verde, it is considered a relatively common species and over 30 individuals have been recorded in Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys (BRUVS) in 220 hours of underwater footage between 2015–2017 (MarAlliance 2019; S. Pires, S.&#160;</span>Ratão<span style="""">&#160;unpubl. data 2020). It was also listed in&#160;cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys and represented up to 96.4% of catches with up to eight individuals in one trawl haul (Krakstad<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011). In the Gambia, only one individual was recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 although other species of rays with&#160;similar catchability were reported in large quantities (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was rarely detected in water samples with only two individuals confirmed from market surveys where they were sold fresh for local consumption (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020).&#160;It was also frequently recorded in 2019 in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). It has been reported from Nigerian research surveys however catch quantities are not available (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). It was not detected in&#160;recent landing sites surveys in Western Ghana between 2019–2020&#160;and from Angola&#160;during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018&#160;(I. Seidu and A.L. Soares&#160;unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, 21 individuals have been recorded over two years of landing site surveys representing 0.9% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In&#160;São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe, a few individuals have been recorded&#160;from surveys of local markets and on BRUVS footage&#160;(G.&#160;Porriños unpubl. data 2020). There, this species is also targeted by spear fishers and small individuals are sometimes observed in catches from demersal longline and gillnet fisheries (G.&#160;Porriños unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species is still captured regularly, and it is still also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets with one or two large individuals recorded each day of survey (CPUE of 13.5 kg per day of fishing) (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In the Republic of the Congo, 30 individuals were recorded during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019, most of which were caught in gillnets targeting sardines close to shore between January and July (P.

However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M.

Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks; however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K.

This species is taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, line gear, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range, and possibly coastal industrial fisheries using trawls.

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

However, although smaller than its congener the Daisy Whipray (<em>Fontitrygon margarita</em>), it is important to note that these species are still confused and records are likely to be aggregated. This species was only recorded in Guinea during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). Yet, in Senegal, this species is now commonly recorded in artisanal fisheries landings along the coast (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Here, while rays are now commonly marketed, small species were likely to be discarded in the past due to their low commercial value but have now become utilized bycatch (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, in The Gambia, this previously unused ray has recently become commercially targeted in response to a declining shark fishery (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). During landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018, this species dominated landings of rays and was intensively utilized (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, it is commonly recorded in both artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries (M. Dia, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was detected in water samples accounting for 62% of ray DNA and was confirmed from market surveys as one of the most commonly landed ray species (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). Landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 7% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Nigeria, although quantities are not available, this species is very commonly captured in industrial trawl fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). It was not detected in 2019 landing site surveys in Côte d'Ivoire (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other dasyatids (Brown Stingray (<em>Bathytoshia lata</em>), Marbled Stingray (<em>Dasyatis marmorata</em>), Common Stingray (<em>D. pastinaca</em>), Pearl Whipray, and Round Stingray (<em>Taeniurops grabatus</em>)) were considered common and represented 18.5% of rays captured in 2018 (99.9% mortality rate) and 26.5% in 2019 (100% mortality rate) (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). Overall, dasyatids in trawl fisheries represented 4.6% of trawl production in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. This species was also recorded throughout the year from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and represented 1% of ray landings (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, this species was not recorded during surveys undertaken between January and December 2019, however, records of the Daisy Whipray which represented up to 4% of landings might have included this species (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, landings of the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray represented up to 70% of all shark and ray records over two years of landing site surveys between 2018–2019 (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, this species represented 31% of all sharks and rays reported through a citizen science network set up in Cameroon between 2019–2020 (A. Takoukam Kamla pers. comm. 07/07/2020). In Angola, 10 individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in overall shark, ray, and skate populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The species is exposed to intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, has a lack of refuge at depth, is susceptible to fisheries, and there are noted declines in rays in general across its range. However, the species is still relatively abundant and common across its range. It is suspected that the Pearl Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Pearl Whipray is&#160;found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b; R.W.

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also salted-dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, it is sometimes used as animal feed (e.g., for chickens in Ghana; I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Pearl Whipray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all sharks, rays, and skates from the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone and ray catch-per-unit-effort and elasmobranch landings from India were used to infer declines of 59–92% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). These trends are not species-specific but informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.

Inshore fishing pressure is high across the species range yet there is much lower fishing effort in the deeper part of the Indian Ring Skate's shelf distribution  and refuge at depth on the upper continental slopes. It is suspected that the Indian Ring Skate is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).</p><p></p>","The Indian Ring Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 17–462 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 53 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~35 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Reproduction is oviparous and a spawning ground has been identified on Wadge Bank, southwest India (Chembian 2010; misidentified as Brown Skate&#160;<em>Raja miraletus,</em> K.K.

In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020). Currently, 330 deep-water trawlers operate from Kerala and Tamil Nadu targeting deep-water resources in the Wadge Bank area, southwest India (K. K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In more inshore waters, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing  effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al. </em>2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions and anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020).","The population of the Indian Ring Skate is estimated to have declined in Wadge Bank, southwest India by 62% over 11 years. Observed catches declined from 1,080–416 individuals from 2008 to 2018 despite increased fishing effort during that time (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). This represents a reduction of 95% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure on the continental shelf are also reported. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr&#160;in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Across India, landings  of elasmobranchs have declined by 44% from 1998 to 2018, despite  increasing effort which infers a decline in their populations (Gupta <em>et al.</em> 2020). <br/><br/> Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In Sri Lanka, reconstructed landings data showed a five-fold increase over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. Total catches have fluctuated greatly but continued to rise overall with foreign catches within the Sri Lanka EEZ increasing from the mid-1980s (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). A population trend cannot be inferred as effort has also increased during this period.   <br/><br/>  In Myanmar, the Indian Ring Skate is rare in landing sites (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Reconstructed landings of all sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–1980 and 2013 exhibited a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Catch rates declined more for rays than for sharks.&#160;Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species (San San Khine 2010)  which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). <br/><p></p><p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Indian Ring Skate (31 years), they represent declines of 61%, 92%, and 59% in Bangladesh, Mumbai and across India, respectively. Trends cannot be determined for Sri Lanka and Myanmar, though declines of ray populations are suspected in recent years in Myanmar. These trends are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader trends for batoids in the region. In Wadge Bank, southwest India, the species has undergone an estimated reduction of 95% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of the Indian Ring Skate, but most of the pressure is on the continental shelf with only a relatively small level of effort in offshore fisheries and this species would have refuge at depth. Although there is a high level of fishing effort on the shallow part of this species depth range, there is much lower effort on the deeper part of its shelf distribution and refuge at depth for most of its depth range. It is suspected that the Indian Ring Skate is close to reaching the population reduction threshold.</p>",Decreasing,"The Indian Ring Skate is found from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal in the Western and Eastern Indian Oceans.

Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T.

The demersal trawl fishery occurs from 50 to 500 m, the Greenland halibut fishery usually operates down to 650 m&#160;and therefore this species has significant refuge at depth. There are deep-water longline fisheries for grenadiers historically down to 1,000 m with the bulk of catches (up to 95% and more) consisting of grenadiers with minor bycatch of snailfishes, morids, sculpins, and skates (A.

Pacific Cod have been overfished since the 1970 throughout all regions of Japan and overfishing is currently occurring, or probably occurring, in all regions (Chen 2014).&#160;This species may derive some benefit of reduction in fishing mortality as a result of fisheries closures following the Great East Japan Earthquake, and resultant tsunami, on 11th March 2011, resulting in restrictions for Pacific Cod fisheries at least until the last day of 2014 (Narimatsu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","<p>The Whitebelly Skate has a deep depth range (300–1,000 m) within reach of most demersal trawl and longlines fisheries within its distribution off eastern Honshu and Hokkaido.

However, this species is likely to have refuge from fishing pressure across some of its core distribution and range. Yet,&#160;considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its northern range, and noted declines in landings of rays across its range, it&#160;is suspected that the Biscuit Skate has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation in parts of its&#160;range and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</span>","<span style="""">The Biscuit Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 43–930 m (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Pascual-Alayon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). It reaches a maximum size of 91 cm total length (TL) with males mature at ~56–68 cm TL and females mature at ~55–71 cm TL. Reproduction is oviparous with a size-at-birth of ~17 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Little else is known of its biology. There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on age parameters for the Spotted Skate (<em>Raja montagui</em>). The Spotted Skate has an age-at-maturity of 4 years and a maximum age of 7 years, resulting in a generation length of 5.6 years (Gallagher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). This has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West Africa and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal&#160;(Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many commercial demersal and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania and 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau (Sobrino&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In Mauritania, there are demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In these trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), but further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown. As part of their tuna SFPA, The Gambia also allows three deep-water demersal trawls to fish&#160;for hake species at depths of 150–850 m (European Commission 2020).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p>","Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance from South Africa (Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture,&#160;Forestry&#160;and Fisheries, unpubl. data 2020). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (21 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates from&#160;demersal trawl surveys conducted during autumn, spring, and summer along the South Africa south coast (1991–2019) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.7%, consistent with a median reduction of 18.3% decrease over the past three generation lengths (21 years), with the highest probability (54%) <span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">of  no major reductions in population over three  generation lengths (20  years) (that is, reductions &lt;20%). Overall, in South Africa, up to<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;300 t of this species are recorded each year in inshore trawl, line fish, and demersal shark longline fisheries (C.

In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase substantially in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013).</span></p><span style="""">First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of&#160;Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana. Population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but do indicate rising fishing pressure.&#160;Since the 1970s, the greatest African fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries were located in Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). Across West Africa,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) decreased by 71% between 1970–2015 from 0.68t/kW to 0.20 t/kw (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch landings increased by more than 2.5 times from 1970 to 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), implying an increase in fishing effort. Within countries, landings have begun to decline&#160;in recent years. For example, in&#160;Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased from 1950 to 1972 then declined by 80% from 1972 to 1981. Landings increased again until 2001 followed by a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline from 2001 to 2016.<br/><br/>These declines in landings can be inferred to&#160;represent population reductions as the&#160;fishing effort has remained stable during the decline (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Overall, in the northwest Africa region (Morocco to Guinea-Bissau), total elasmobranch catch in the industrial sector increased by a factor of ten&#160;between 1970 and 2015 while total industrial fishing effort increased by 45% (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The industrial elasmobranch CPUE of the region more than doubled during this timeframe (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). While these levels of change are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks and rays in the region.&#160;</span><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p><span style="""">Second, data are sparse throughout the species range. Although other species of skates are sometimes recorded in landings, this species is relatively uncommon in landings even though many trawl&#160;fisheries operate throughout most of this species' range, especially in Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea. This&#160;likely reflects its&#160;preference for deep-water habitats across its range.

Little information is available on fishing pressure throughout the rest of its range (south through the Gulf of Guinea).&#160;It is reported that the sea floor is not trawlable at depths greater than 75 m in the Gulf of Guinea, and demersal stocks in offshore waters (i.e., 75–200 m) therefore remain under-exploited (Williams 1968, Martos&#160;</span><em style="""">et al</em><span style="""">. 1991, Mensah and Quaatey 2002).

It is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates usually near river mouths and estuaries at depths to 10 m, and possibly 40 m. The species is taken as bycatch in trawl, seine net, and trap fisheries and retained for its meat in some areas. It was reported as common in Papua where it was first described in 2006 and has also since been reported as common in southern Papua New Guinea, part of its now broader range. There has been no reported population reduction over the 12 years since it was first described, although its population trend prior to 2006 is unknown. An ecological risk assessment found Hortle's Whipray to be at medium risk in the Gulf of Papua Prawn trawl fishery. Habitat destruction and river pollution are threats to this inshore species with a 30% reduction in mangrove area in Papua New Guinea from 1980 to 2005. It is suspected that Hortle's Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (56 years) due to levels of fishing pressure and a reduction in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable

The removal of large areas of mangrove forest, and mining practices (which are intense in southern New Guinea) are most likely impacting this species' inshore habitat. The mangrove area in Papua New Guinea was reduced by 30% over 25 years from 1980 to 2005 (FAO 2007). This was caused primarily by human pressures for rural livelihoods, commercial activities, and overexploitation of mangrove forest for timber for housing and carvings (FAO 2007).","Initially, this species was only known from southern Papua, but it has since been found to have a wider range (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White <em>et al</em>. 2018).

It is benthopelagic from inshore to a depth of 340 m. The species is taken as bycatch of demersal trawl and gill net, and possibly longline fisheries, and is discarded at sea in Japan and retained in Taiwan, and likely China, for fish meal. There are no species-specific population trends, although it is regularly captured in Taiwan in low numbers and the landings have remained stable for the past 19 years (at least two generation lengths). With no concurrent effort data, no population trend can be inferred, however catch-per-unit effort of all rays has remained stable in the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) over 17 years. Reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan and China EEZs indicate declines of 82 and 34% over the past three generation lengths (24 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are indicative of the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. Fishing pressure is high across most  of the range of the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl  bans in China and Taiwan respectively, its lack of current capture in Papua New Guinea and pelagic mobility may afford the species some refuge from  fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray has undergone a population reduction of  20–29% over the last three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray is benthopelagic on continental shelves and slopes mainly offshore at depths of 1–340 m (Haas and Ebert 2006, Weigmann 2016, White <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species may be fairly active when pelagic, similar to other <em>Tetronarce </em>species (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 89 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~62 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous and size-at-birth is ~20–25 cm TL (Haas and Ebert 2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, the Pacific Torpedo (<em>Tetronarce californica</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 9 years and a maximum age of 16 years, resulting in a generation length of 12.5 years (Neer and Cailliet 2001). The Pacific Torpedo is larger than the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray (137 vs 89 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 8 years for the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray.","The Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray is a bycatch of trawl, gillnet, and possibly longline, fisheries, It is likely discarded at sea in Japan but retained in Taiwan, and likely China, for fish meal.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray. The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017).   The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019a, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019).   <p>In response to fish stocks depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/></p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22884015"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka, pers. comm. 1 September 2019). <br/></a></p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884015"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The</a> number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).</p><p>In Papua New Guinea (PNG), this species is not currently captured by any commercial fisheries; it is only known in PNG from a single specimen taken off Kavieng, New Ireland on research surveys (White <em>et al.</em> 2017, White and Ko’ou 2018). There are no commercial trawl fisheries in Kavieng, though it may be a potential catch of the tuna longline fisheries and coastal artisanal fisheries (NFA 2020, White<em> et al.</em> 2020).&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>The Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray is caught regularly in Taiwan in low numbers with little change in its observed abundance at landing sites over the last 19 years (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), although there is no concurrent effort data from the area of the sites with which to infer population trends. In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).<br/> <br/><a name=""_Hlk22720982"">Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 </a>to 2014 have been reconstructed for Japan and China EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. <br/></p><p>In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray (24 years) they represent declines of 82% and 34% in&#160; Japan and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, and lack of current capture in Papua New Guinea would provide some refuge from fishing pressure. It is also likely fairly active when pelagic which could lessen the threat from fishing gear. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (24 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Taiwanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific from Japan to northern Papua New Guinea, including China (Kinmen Islands), Taiwan, and possibly the Philippines (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Bandai <em>et al.</em> 2017, White<em> et al. </em>2017, Shao 2019).","The meat is likely to be poor quality, similar to that of the Japanese Pelagic Torpedo Ray (<em>Tetronarce tokionis</em>), and thus may not be used for human consumption but for fish meal (D.

In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang, unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019).

Pacific Cod have been overfished since the 1970  throughout all regions of Japan and overfishing is currently occurring,  or probably occurring, in all regions (Chen 2014). In Russia, there are deep-water longline fisheries for grenadiers historically down to 1,000 m with the bulk of catches (up to 95% and more) consisting of grenadiers with minor bycatch of snailfishes, morids, sculpins, and skates (A. Orlov pers. obs. 2007).&#160;More recently, in the past 2–3 years, there are occasional experimental fisheries that fish down to 2,500 m (I.V. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). This species was collected at 600–700 m in eastern coast of Republic of Korea in 2009 (C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019) and trawl fisheries reach down to over 1,000 m in east Korea. <br/></p><p></p>","The Golden Skate has a deep depth range (58–1,125 m) but remains within the depth range of fisheries within its distribution.&#160;There is significant overlap of fisheries with this species across a significant fraction 10–20% of its range, hence, it is suspected that the New Golden Skate is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).",Decreasing,"The Golden Skate is found in the Northwest Pacific Ocean from Russia to Japan, through the western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, Russia, down through the Kuril Islands to northern Hokkaido and the northern Sea of Japan down to Peter Great Bay, Russia and Shimane Prefecture, Japan (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).","In Russia, skate bycatch have been landed since 2000 and wings are most likely exported to the Republic of Korea (I.V.

It occurs in shallow inshore waters in summer and moves to deeper waters on the continental shelf in winter to a depth of 110 m. It has a moderate age-at-maturity of 7 years and small litters of 1–7 pups. The species is captured by trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach seine, and gill net fisheries. It is not utilized and although previously persecuted by recreational fishers, it is now discarded  alive by recreational  and artisanal fishers, with variable mortality from trawling likely ranging from 17–70%. Trend analysis of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas estimated a population reduction of 62% over the past three generation lengths (31.5 years), with the highest probability of a 50–79% reduction over the past three generation lengths.<strong> </strong>Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over some of its range  likely driven by steep declines preceding a substantial reduction in  fishing effort in South Africa, combined with a suspected range shift  away from the trawl grounds due to climate change that likely accounts for some of the estimated  reduction, minimal fishing pressure and refuge elsewhere (with a stable trend in shore-angling nominal catches), it is suspected that  the Blue Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the  past three generation lengths (31.5 years) due to levels of  exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Blue Stingray is benthic in inshore shallow bays, estuaries, and sheltered sandy beaches in summer, and moves offshore to mid-continental shelf waters in winter to a depth of 110 m (Cowley 1990, Bianchi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of 75 cm disc width (DW); males mature at ~41 cm DW and females mature at 50 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 1–7 pups, a gestation period of ~9 months, and size-at-birth of 17 cm DW (Cowley 1990, Ebert and Cowley 2009). Female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 14 years; generation length is therefore 10.5 years (Cowley 1997).","The Blue Stingray is captured by trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach seine, and gill net fisheries (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). The trawl fisheries in South Africa have decreased in effort over the last decade, particularly the trawl fishery off KwaZulu-Natal (S. Fennessy unpubl. data 2018). All fisheries combined in South Africa have landed less than 1 t annually of Blue Stingray from 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Effort in South African shore line fisheries has decreased as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches. Parts of Namibia are remote and offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since 2002, artisanal and recreational fishing pressure in a few parts of southern Angola has increased while other areas remain unfished (Beckensteiner <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Blue Stingray is not utilized and although 30 years ago it was persecuted by recreational fishers likely causing high post-release mortality (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019), it is now discarded  alive by recreational and artisanal fishers, with mortality from trawling likely variable; at-vessel-mortality for trawled congeneric stingrays ranges from 17–70% (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). Refuge for this species could be provided by extensive areas of the Agulhas Bank, South Africa that are  untrawlable, and several inshore bays and marine protected areas along the  South African coast that are closed to trawling. <br/> <br/> The Blue Stingray has tended to move northeast within South Africa over three decades from 1981–2016, from the wide shelf area of Agulhus Bank to the narrower shelf area to the east (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2019). This shift is concurrent with a reduction in the probability of encounter in the DAFF research trawl surveys (Supplementary Information Figure 2). The range shift and reduction in likelihood of encounter are likely at least partially related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al. </em>2010, Blamey <em>et al.</em> 2015). The range shift may represent a loss of habitat to this species.","There are no estimates of population size for the Blue Stingray. Population trend data of annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016) in commercially fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (31.5 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/><span style="""">The  trend  analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 3.3% over the trawl grounds,  consistent  with  an estimated reduction of 62.4% over the past three generation  lengths (31.5   years), with the highest probability (51.4%) of a 50–79%  reduction  over the past three generation lengths.</span> The estimated reduction is driven partly by a steep decline in catch  rates during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was  substantially higher; over the last two decades the population reduction  has been less dramatic. Some reduction is likely a result of a  northeast range shift in abundance away from the trawl grounds from 1941 to 2016 due to climate  change (Supplementary Information Figure 2; Currie <em>et al. </em>2019). This geographic range shift is also supported by observed increased abundance of the Blue Stingray on the South African east coast; research trawls found this species was absent from the east coast during the 1920s–1930s and then it became fairly common and increased in abundance from the 1980s onwards (S. Fennessy, Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data 2018). Further to the above trend data, monitoring of retained catches in KwaZulu-Natal recreational shore-angling from 1977 to 2012 indicated nominal catches of the Blue Stingray were stable over that period (S. Fennessy, Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data 2018). Some catch data are from angling competitions that target aggregations (S. Fennessy, Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data, 2018) and without concurrent effort data there is some uncertainty whether the nominal catch stability represents an actual stable population.<br/><br/>Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over some of its range, likely driven by steep declines preceding a substantial reduction in fishing effort in South Africa combined with a suspected range shift away from the trawl grounds due to climate change that likely accounts for some of the estimated reduction, minimal fishing pressure elsewhere (with a stable trend in shore-angling nominal catches), it is suspected that the Blue Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (31.5 years) due to levels of exploitation.<br/><span style=""""></span>",Decreasing,"The Blue Stingray is a southern African endemic occurring from central Angola to St. Lucia, South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans (Cowley 1997, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","<p>The Blue Stingray has not been recorded in trade, and is not known to be utilized.</p>",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place.

Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is of a similar size to the Blackspotted Catshark (48 cm vs 53 cm TL) and thus based on size, the generation length is inferred as 15 years for the Indonesian Speckled Catshark.","<p>The Indonesian Speckled Catshark is taken as target and bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. Members of the <em>Halaelurus</em> genus are reported as common in prawn trawl bycatch (White 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Indonesia, the species is noted as caught irregularly by demersal longline fisheries that operate offshore, and occasionally caught by gillnet trammel net (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).  Fishers from Tanjung Luar, Lombok target sharks from southern Bali across the Flores Sea and to the Makassar Strait and Java Sea (Simeon <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Indonesian Speckled Catshark was also likely taken by trawl, though trawlers were banned  in 1980. Mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country but not in the area where the Indonesian Speckled Catshark occurs  (Chong <em>et al.</em> 1987. Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In  Indonesia, fishing effort is intense and across all sectors has been  increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s (Tull 2014).  Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan  fishery globally, and  substantial catches of target and bycatch  chondrichthyans (White<em> et al.</em>  2006). It has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years  (Oakes and Sant 2019).

Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D.

It occurs on the continental shelf and upper slopes at depths of 70–705 m. This species is taken as bycatch of trawl and longline fisheries and, similar to other skates in the region, is either retained for consumption or discarded. There are currently a number of European and Chinese distant-water vessels using trawls and longlines to target demersal fish and shrimp species that reach the depth limit of this species, especially in the northern part of its range in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau.<br/><br/>While species-specific data are not available, declines in landings of combined skates and rays have been documented in the northern portion of its range. For example, a study of the elasmobranch bycatch of the Spanish trawl fishery targeting hake off Mauritania, showed that landings of rajids combined decreased by the equivalent of a 75% population reduction of the Whitedapple Skate over the past three generation lengths (18 years); if landings trends reflect decrease in abundance. However, little information is available on fishing pressure throughout the rest of its range, south through the Gulf of Guinea. In this region, the sea floor is reported to be not trawlable at depths of 75–200 m and demersal stocks in these waters therefore reportedly remain unexploited which might provide a refuge for this species from trawl fisheries throughout the central and southern parts of its range.<br/><br/>Further information is urgently needed to determine the level of impact on this species, particularly as deep-water fisheries are expanding in response to declining fish stocks in heavily exploited coastal areas.

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). This has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West Africa and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal&#160;(Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many commercial demersal and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania and 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau (Sobrino&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In Mauritania, there are demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In these trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), but further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown. As part of their tuna SFPA, The Gambia also allows three deep-water demersal trawls to fish&#160;for hake species at depths of 150–850 m (European Commission 2020).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).

In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase substantially in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013).</span></p><span style="""">First, in the Eastern Central Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of&#160;Mauritania, Nigeria and Ghana.

The species is a bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and possibly gillnet fisheries and is retained in some fisheries and discarded in others. Where discarded, it likely has high post-release survival.<br/><br/>There are no data on the population trends for this species. However, previously it was considered to be locally abundant in Japan and Taiwan, despite fishing pressure. It is still common in Taiwan, which indicates some  resilience to fishing pressure, but the current abundance in Japan, Republic of Korea, and China is unknown. Similar species of deep-water swellsharks are sensitive to fishing pressure and where they are heavily fished they have undergone severe declines (99%) over the past three generation lengths (45 years). This species may have refuge at depth in parts of its range and fishing pressure has declined in Japan, where most of the species range occurs. Elsewhere, fishing pressure is high, ongoing and is of concern. A precautionary approach leads to it being suspected that the Japanese Swellshark is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to high actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Japanese Swellshark is demersal and epi-pelagic on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 18–790 m (Nakabo 2013, Weigmann 2016, I. V. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). Four individuals of 75–80 cm total length (TL) were captured in 1983 in three separate mid-water trawls, all at depths of 660–790 m (I. V. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 114.5 cm total length (TL), males mature at 86 cm TL and females mature at 92 cm TL (Taniuchi 1988, Horie and Tanaka 2002). Reproduction is oviparous with egg cases apparently laid year-round and size-at-birth of 18 cm TL (Taniuchi 1988, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Nothing else is known of its biology.

In Japan, in Nagasaki,  Kyushu, and Mie Prefectures it is usually caught on longline and retained as it is a valued food (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). It may also be captured by a deep-water dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m and an Alaska Pollock (<em>Theragra chalcogramma</em>)  fishery that operates off the northeast coast of Hokkaido to depths of 500 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019, Y. Dyldin unpubl.  data 2019). It is possibly captured in Suruga Bay, where demersal gillnets target fish and crustaceans in the winter at depths of 100–500 m.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere in Japan, it is mostly taken by demersal trawl fisheries that operate at depths of 200–800 m and it is discarded (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The species has been observed to be still alive after 1–2 days in the fish  market, hence it is likely to have high post-release survival (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The fishing effort within the Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone has declined by approximately one-third since the 1950s (Antimacara <em>et al. </em>2011). Across Japan, demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>The species is a possible bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off the northeast coast of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D. Ebert pers. comm. 28/08/2019). It may be taken by commercial deep-water longlines on the eastern coast of Taiwan that operate to a depth of 300 m where all incidental catch is also retained (H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The species may be caught by Chinese trawlers that operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019), and is likely captured by South Korean fisheries.","There are no population trend data for the species. The Japanese Swellshark was previously noted as locally abundant, even in areas heavily fished by trawlers (Iglésias <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is still considered very common in north Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b) but its current abundance in Japan, South Korea, and China is unknown. The species was rarely captured in Russian research deep-water trawl surveys off Japan with five individuals recorded from 1982–1983 (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). Fishing pressure across Japan has declined by approximately one-third since the 1950s with dramatic declines in trawl fishing pressure over the past three decades. Line fishing pressure still exists in Japan, albeit at lower levels than historically, and fishing pressure in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and China is high with the species retained (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011, Kuo and Booth 2011, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/><br/>Other deep-water swellsharks are sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries  management is implemented, intensive fishing can  lead to significant  declines. In the Southwest Pacific,  the&#160;standardized  catch-per-unit-effort for the Whitefin  Swellshark (<em>Cephaloscyllium albipinnum</em>) in the Southern  and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery, Australia,  decreased by 73%&#160;from  1994–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;This  decline was equivalent to a ~99%  population reduction over the past  three generation lengths of the Whitefin Swellshark (45 years) (Pardo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). The Japanese Swellshark was considered to be locally abundant across Japan and Taiwan despite fishing pressure. It is still common in Taiwan which indicates some resilience to, or depth refuge from, fishing pressure. Fishing pressure has declined in Japan, where most of this species range occurs. Declines in similar species exposed to high fishing pressure, and ongoing high fishing pressure on this species in the southerly parts of its range are cause for concern.

The species is likely a bycatch of deep-water demersal trawl and longline and is retained in Taiwan and possibly South Korea for human consumption and fish meal, and is likely discarded in Japan. There is no species-specific population trend data. The species is rarely captured in Japan, infrequently captured in Taiwan, and possibly taken in part of South Korea, and some Chinese fisheries. Medium-sized to large <em>Dipturus</em> species are susceptible to overfishing due to their relatively low biological productivity, which is of concern for the Bigtail Skate.

Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S.

However, most of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is too shallow for this species, with its occurrence limited to an area off the east coast that extends beyond a depth of 300 m. Fishing effort in South Korea increased markedly in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al</em>. 2014). It may be encountered in Chinese trawl fisheries that operate to a depth of 300 m (X.

Intense small-scale trawl fishing in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013) may threaten this species, however it has not been noted from trawl fisheries in Mozambique (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 25 April 2018). Deep-water trawling effort is increasing in Madagascar waters (Cripps <em>et al. </em>2015,  R.

Very few  specimens have been caught in research surveys, despite extensive sampling on the shelf and upper  slope within its known range, and this species is considered rare (Compagno and Heemstra 2007). The fisheries in South Africa have decreased in effort over the last decade, however, the Natal Sleeper Ray population may be affected by trawl fisheries operating off southern Mozambique and Madagascar.  Overall, the majority of the species range is exposed to trawl fishing pressure, though this has recently decreased in some areas, it is not captured in longline fisheries, and it likely has refuge in marine protected areas. Therefore, it is suspected that a  population reduction of 20–29% has occurred over the past three  generations (15 years)<strong> </strong>as a result of actual levels of exploitation (bycatch).<strong></strong>",Decreasing,"The Natal Sleeper Ray is a southern African endemic occurring from Algoa Bay, South Africa to southern Mozambique and southwestern Madagascar in the Western Indian Ocean&#160;(Last <em>et al. </em>2016, D.

Following two centuries of fisheries development, target shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).</span><p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010 - these were mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal&#160;areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).

Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years. The highest losses recorded from are from Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span></p>","<span style="""">There are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.

This is an iconic species that is captured by both commercial and recreational fishing throughout its range and has experienced dramatic population declines as a result. The species is also impacted by the loss of important nursery estuarine habitat, as well as disturbance from divers and spear fisherman in some parts of its range. It was regionally assessed as Vulnerable for the Mediterranean in 2007. This species has been shown to benefit from in-place conservation actions including no-take zones and marine protected areas. It has experienced dramatic declines in the past. FAO catch statistics indicated an increase in landings from a peak of 735 t in 1988, followed by steady fluctuating declines to 161 t in 2005, with an average of 148 t in the period 2001 to 2005 in the Mediterranean. This indicated an approximate 70% decline in landings over 25 years (~1.5 generation lengths) from 1980-2005 for part of its range with an overall inferred decline between 30-50% for the Mediterranean. This indicated an approximate 70% decline in landings over 25 years (~1.5 generation lengths) from 1980-2005 for part of its range with an overall inferred decline between 30-50% for the Mediterranean. More recent catch statistics fluctuated over the past two decades but show an overall increasing trend, suggesting that the species has undergone some degree of recovery since it was assessed at the regional scale in 2007. However, landing data has to be treated with caution as no fishery effort data are available. Population increases are inferred from the FAO landings data but require confirmation, and are likely to be conservation dependent as significant declines could result from removal of any conservation actions or management protection. Therefore this species is listed as Near Threatened and conservation dependent. Ongoing monitoring of population trends is recommended.","This is a demersal species that occurs in shallow coastal waters mainly on rocky and adjacent sandy substrata to 200 m deep. Younger individuals often enter estuaries and become more active at night. It is generally a nocturnal fish but it can sometimes be encountered during the day among seagrass beds, on rocky bottoms close to caves or large crevices in which it can shelter. It lives in small groups and is a sedentary species with strong site-fidelity and low mobility (Alós and Cabanellas-Reboredo 2012). It feeds on small fishes and crustaceans (Chao 1986). Spawning occurs near estuaries and the reproductive period for this species is May-July. The maximum size for this species is 75 cm (Dieuzeide <em>et al</em>. 1955) but more recently individuals that exceed 60 cm are very rare (Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;<br/><br/>This species can live to 31 years of age (Morat&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and age at maturity is 3-4 years for males and females (Fiorentino <em>et al.</em> 2001, Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2002, Grau <em>et al</em>. 2009). Size at first maturity is ~25 cm total length for males and ~30 cm for females (Grau <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is about 17 years. This was calculated using the following equation: Age at first maturity + (maximum age - age at first maturity)/2","Over-exploitation by fisheries is a major threat to this species. It is heavily exposed to fisheries during spawning aggregations at the mouth of estuaries. As well as direct fishery exploitation, the species may also be disturbed by divers and spear fishermen, forcing the animals to be less concentrated and much more dispersed in small coastal caves and below rocks (A. Di Natale pers. comm. 2007).&#160;In addition to fishing pressure at its spawning grounds, degradation of estuaries from coastal development threatens the nursery grounds of this species. The subpopulation on the east side of the Marmara Sea was reduced due to pollution (Artüz 2006).","<p>Population data are not available from across most of this species' range, with most detailed information available for the Mediterranean Sea.

This indicated an approximate 70% decline in landings over 25 years from 1980-2005 for part of its range with an overall inferred decline between 30-50% for the Mediterranean. More recently, FAO catch statistics from 10 countries across its range show fluctuating landings but the overall trend shows a gradual increase in landings since the early 2000s (FishStat 2019).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Sciaena umbra </em>is found in the eastern Atlantic from the English Channel to Mauritania, including the Canary Islands and throughout the Mediterranean Sea in all coastal areas and is also present in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.

In Turkey, otoliths are ground to a powder and used as remedy for urinary tract infections (Frimodt 1995).<br/><br/>The fish is heavily targeted in its north African range where it is over-exploited by artisanal, semi-industrial and recreational fishing, and the fish is highly susceptible to spear fishing as it is slow moving and accessible (Grau <em>et al.</em> 2009).",Marine,"This species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on Annex III of the Barcelona Convention. The Bern Convention Appendix III requires Parties to protect listed species, but a certain amount of exploitation is permitted if population levels allow. The Annex III listing on the Barcelona Convention also requires the exploitation of these species to be regulated (Abdul Malak <em>et al.</em> 2011). This species has responded well to protection including marine protected areas (MPAs) and no-take zones in the region (Di Franco <em>et al.</em> 2009, Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2009). In a study conducted off Corsica, numerical abundance, biomass, and individual size were found to increase with increasing levels of protection and were significantly lower in areas without protection.

It is the second most common sciaenid in most of this region. It represents 20% of surveyed sciaenid biomass based on trawl surveys from the RV Fridjoft Nansen. These surveys from 1999-2006 have reported a 37% decline in mixed sciaenid biomass. Since the 1990s, fishing effort, including the switch to large pair-trawling fleets with increasing trawling range in most of the surveyed region, has substantially increased due to previous declines in catch. Given that this species is found primarily from 80 m to 160 m (although can be found to as deep as 350 m), which is mostly below the average trawling depth of 25 to 75 m, it is estimated that there has been less than 30% decline over the past 10 years (since 1999). Given that fishing effort is increasing and this species is heavily targeted in at least two countries within its range, it is listed as Near Threatened based on A2bd.","This species spawns often spawns in estuaries (F. Nunoo pers. comm.).  It is found in muddy, sandy and rocky substrates in deeper shelves from 50 m to 350 m, but is most common between 80 m and 160 m. It feeds on worms, fish and small invertebrates, including shrimps. Age at first maturity and longevity is not-well known, but given the maximum potential size of this species, individuals to 40 cm may live less than five years (N.L. Chao pers. comm.). Generation length is therefore estimated to be approximately two to three years.","As technology and demand have increased in western Africa, the fishing mechanisms have evolved from dugout canoes, to motor boats and large trawling ships.&#160;Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon have the largest fleets in the West African region.  In Ghana the sciaenids are exploited by the artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial fishing sub-sectors.  According to a 2006 survey, there are about 11,213 canoes in the artisanal sector, 230 locally built wooden hulled vessels (using trawls and purse seines) in the semi-industrial sector and 100 industrial vessels out of which 64 are trawlers.<br/><br/>The trawlers fish very close to shore (less than 30 m depth) in competition with the artisanal fishers, using huge trawl boards and metal bobbins.  However, due to the nature of the continental shelf and the poor state of most of the vessels, they rarely exceed 100 m from shore at depths not exceeding 75 m.  The resulting habitat degradation, over-harvesting from bad fishing practices such as fishing with light; as well as use of small meshed sized nets and excessive demand (all sizes of fish finds market in West Africa), contribute to the observed over-exploitation of fish resources.  <br/><br/>Demersal species in the region are noted to be over-exploited mainly from high fishing effort and export demand.  Landings have probably&#160;decreased due to a shift in dominance of gears from gill net / beach seine to trawling / pair trawling, as well as an increase in number of boats/permits.<br/><br/>The most common of the sciaenids on the market in the region are<em> P. senegalensis, P. mbizi, P. typus, P. elongatus </em>and<em> P. senegallus</em>, in that respective decreasing order; with the rest forming a total of less than 10% by weight in landings.  The flesh of the sciaenids is popular to consumers, especially in the hospitality industry.  The large sized sciaenids are exported for foreign exchange.  As a result of this demand, prices of croakers on the market are relatively high, falling behind that of highly prized species like the groupers, snappers, seabreams and cephalopods.","This species is the second most common Sciaenidae species observed (estimated to form about 20% of catch by weight as surveyed by the RF Fridjoft Nansen)  in Western Africa (F.

The CPUE is variable during this same time with a peak of 4.4 and a low of 1.7. As effort is expected to increase, biomass is projected to decline further.&#160;Landings have likely decreased due to change in gears from gill net to trawling, as well as an increase in number of boats/permits.&#160;Croakers are important food fish for Nigeria as they constitute about 40% of the total landings on the Nigerian coast (Gaffer 1994).",Decreasing,"This species is found from Guinea to southern Angola, but is especially abundant in Nigerian and Cameroonian waters.

It has a patchy distribution in the Western and Eastern Indian Ocean, from off Kenya, Socotra Island (Yemen), Oman, southern India, the Andaman Islands, and Myanmar. This small shark is viviparous with a low fecundity of two young per litter, suggesting it has low biological productivity. It is a relatively rare bycatch in the deep-water shrimp trawl fishery off southwest India, and there are concerns that the regional population may have been impacted by this intense fishery, though this species may have some refuge in depths outside of the current operations of the trawl fishery (200–500 m). The Bristly Catshark is also likely caught in the Sri Lankan deep-water handline fishery and the new and growing deep-water shark fishery in the Andaman Islands. Given the low productivity of the species and the overlap with fishing pressure across large parts of its range, together with potential refuge in deeper waters, it is suspected that a population reduction approaching 30% has occurred over the past three generations (30 years); therefore, the Bristly Catshark is assessed as Near Threatened, nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d.

Size-at-birth is ~12–13 cm TL. Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is larger than the Bristly Catshark (48 cm vs 37 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 10 years for the Bristly Catshark.","The main threat to this species is the commercial deep-water shrimp trawl fishery operating in the Arabian Sea off southwest India in which the Bristly Catshark is a relatively rare component of the chondrichthyan bycatch (Akhilesh<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2011,&#160;2013).

This species is known to form large schools in coastal waters and can be found in sheltered bays and lagoons. This species is abundant in parts of its range (i.e., the Philippines and Indonesia) and contributes significantly to industrial and commercial sardine fisheries throughout a majority of its range. It is also an important resource for subsistence fishers. It has experienced overfishing in the past and is currently considered overfished in parts of its range (i.e., east Java, Indonesia and the Philippines). It is considered a&#160;superior fish commodity in some areas (e.g., eastern Java), and effort and value have increased in recent years. For example, an uncontrolled increase in the number of purse seine vessels in Indonesia has been attributed with the overfishing of this species in the region as this method targets a large proportion of juveniles and small individuals (~70%). Furthermore, much of this species' geographic range is within areas subjected to heavy exploitation and little regulation (i.e., the East China and Sulu-Celebes Sea); however given its wide range, we suspect that there are small areas of its range where it is not exploited. Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches are available but likely under-represent true catches; however, available&#160;evidence suggests that the population is declining. Based on an exponential regression, the landings have declined by 32% over the past 10 years (thought to represent three generation lengths). Given that this species has been, and currently is being, overfished in parts of its range (i.e., increase in gear efficiency, the number of vessels and market value), but is well regulated in some areas (e.g., Zamboanga Peninsula, Philippines) and is likely not exploited in small parts of its range, it is suspected that the global population decline is at least approaching 30%, and therefore,&#160;<em>Sardinella lemuru&#160;</em>is assessed as Near Threatened under criterion A2bd. More research and population stock assessments are recommended to better understand the population of this species. Likewise, increased monitoring and regulation of fisheries catches is needed to prevent further population decline of this commercially important species.","<em>Sardinella lemuru</em> is a marine pelagic-neritic, oceanodromous species (Riede 2004) that is strongly migratory (Munroe <em>et al. </em>1999). The adult species form large schools in coastal waters, and they are found in sheltered bays and lagoons (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). This species feeds on phytoplankton and zooplankton (Ghofar and Mathews 1995), but mostly copepods (Munroe <em>et al. </em>1999). Individuals reach maturity between 14-15 cm (Whitehead<em> </em>1985). The spawning season has been predicted to occur between September to November in the southern Bali Strait<strong> </strong>off eastern Java (Wujdi <em>et al.</em> 2013); juveniles and small individuals dominate catches between February and March (Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the East China Sea, spawning peaks in late March through May, but continues through August (Munroe <em>et al. </em>1999). Spawning off Western Australia takes place from December to March, with a peak in January to February (Gaughan and Mitchell 2000). Spawning and major migrations appear closely linked with hydrological conditions, especially temperature (Munroe <em>et al. </em>1999) and chlorophyll-<em>a</em> concentrations (Simbolon <em>et al. </em>2017). This species has a maximum standard length of 23.0 cm, but it is more commonly 20.0 cm (Whitehead 1985). Its maximum longevity has been estimated between 6 and 7 years (Gaughan and Mitchell 2000).","This species is one of the most important commercially targeted species in parts of its range with indications of overfishing in the Philippines and Indonesia (Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014, Setyohadi <em>et al</em>. 2016). The overfishing of small pelagic fisheries has been reported in the Sulu-Celebes Sea due to an increase in the improved efficiency of fishing gears and an increase in the number of vessels (Pedrosa-Gerasmio <em>et al.</em> 2015). A large proportion (~70%) of juveniles can be caught in eastern Java due   to the increased use of purse seines (Simbolan <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is possible that overfishing in the Philippines may pose a threat to this species (Giducos <em>et al. </em>2015); however, a recent report (Rola <em>et al. </em>2018) suggests that local subpopulations respond well to fisheries management practices (e.g., annual closures). Other major threats to this species are unknown.","<em>Sardinella lemuru</em> is widely distributed throughout the Philippines and is the most abundant species of <em>Sardinella</em> (Willette and Santos 2013).

In the Bali Strait, this species reaches peak landings during cold  periods and dominates during the southeast monsoon season (Sartimbul <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/>  <p>Globally, landings of <em>Sardinella lemuru </em>are reported to the FAO from Indonesia and averaged about 56,900 tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 (FAO 2016<strong>)</strong>. Overall, landings have increased throughout the time series (1950 – 2014) but have declined by approximately 57% since the highest peak of approximately 154,000 tonnes in 1998 to 66,500 tonnes in 2014. Landings were not reported from Indonesia in the Western Pacific during the years 2005 – 2011 (FAO 2016); however, it is unlikely that this species was not landed given its long term commercial importance in the region. It is possible that this species was included in mixed landings or misidentified during these years, but this cannot be quantified. Reconstructed catches, driven by Indonesia (Pauly and Zeller 2015), have fluctuated but remain relatively stable in the most recent years (2001-2010). Small quantities (&lt;1,000 tonnes per year) are reconstructed from Australia and Timor Leste (Pauly and Zeller 2015). Overall, the reconstructed catches are higher than landings reported to the FAO, averaging just over 71,700 tonnes (1950 – 2010). However, catches were not reconstructed from some countries where this species is abundant and commercially important (i.e., the Philippines and China: Munroe <em>et al.</em> 1999, Willette and Santos 2013, Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pedrosa-Geramio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, the reconstructed catches and the landings reported to the FAO likely under-represent the true catches of this species. </p>  <p>Despite the discrepancies between the landings and reconstructed catch data, and the lack of data from some presumably important countries,<span style=""""> there are indications that this species is declining.</span> As this species probably has a highly fluctuating population, calculating long-term trends in population status can be more representative if more data are used. Therefore, an exponential regression was applied to a time period beginning where a decline in landings reported to the FAO can be attributed to exploitation (1990 - 2014), resulting in a decline of 32% over the most recent ten years available (2005-2014), thought to represent three generation lengths for this species.&#160;</p>  <p>We suspect there are small parts of this species range where it is not exploited and therefore, a 32% decline probably represents a slight overestimate. Furthermore, reports show that this species is fished sustainably in the Zamboanga Province (Region IX) of the Philippines (E-value = 0.5: Barut <em>et al. </em>2017) following the successful implementation of annual fishery closures in 2011 (Rola <em>et al. </em>2018). However, based on an inferred decline of 32% in landings reported to the FAO and existing evidence that this species has been, and currently is being, overfished in parts of its range (i.e., increase in gear efficiency, the number of vessels and market value: <span style="""">Purwanto 2011, </span><span style="""">Pedrosa-Gerasmio <em>et al.</em> 2015, Setyohadi <em>et al. </em>2016, Simbolon <em>et al</em>. 2017) but likely not all of its range</span>, it is suspected that the true population decline is at least approaching 30%.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Sardinella lemuru</em> is found in the Eastern Indian Ocean, specifically from Phuket, Thailand; along the southern coasts of East Java and Bali, Indonesia (Willette and Santos 2013); Timor-Leste (Pauly and Zeller 2015); and Western Australia (Kailola <em>et al.</em> 1993, Gaughan and Mitchell 2000). It is also found in the Western Pacific, specifically from northern Viet Nam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and southern Japan (Willette and Santos 2013), excluding the Ryukyu Islands (H. Hata pers. comm. 2017). This species is found at a depth range between 15 to 100 m (Whitehead 1985).","This species is commercially and economically important to fisheries throughout its distribution including the East China and Sulu-Celebes Seas, specifically off the Fujian and eastern Guandong provinces of China, the Philippines and Indonesia (Munroe <em>et al.</em> 1999, Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pedrosa-Geramio <em>et al.</em> 2015, Baum <em>et al.</em> 2016, Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). Reports indicate that this species has been overfished in parts of its range (i.e., the Philippines and East Java: Purwanto 2011, Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014). The FAO Yearbook of Fishery Statistics reported a yearly catch range of around 106,700 to 13,800 tonnes from Indonesia between 1990 to 1995 (Munroe <em>et al. </em>1999). This species is a superior fish commodity in eastern Java and has been increasing in price (Setyohadi <em>et al. </em>2016). It is also the second most important subsistence and commercial fish commodity in mainland Jarkarta (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species is important nutritionally to subsistence fishers (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2016), economically to local artisanal fishers and commercially as a raw fish material for processing industries in Indonesia (Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is utilized on a national scale and is exported internationally to the U.S., Europe, and parts of the Middle East (Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches within the Strait of Bali are dominated by this species and can make up as much as 81.85% of total catch (Simbolan <em>et al.</em> 2017). Individuals less than 15 cm are regarded as juvenile and are considered to be an illegal size for capture (Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). A large proportion (~70%) of juveniles can be caught in eastern Java due to less size selective fishing gears (i.e., purse seines: Simbolan <em>et al.</em> 2017). An uncontrolled increase in the number of purse seine vessels has led to the over exploitation of this species in the Bali Strait (Purwanto 2011). In the Philippines, this species is one of the most important commercially targeted species and has experienced overfishing along with other species of <em>Sardinella</em> (i.e., <em>S. gibbosa</em> and <em>S. fimbriata</em>: Luceño <em>et al.</em> 2014); however, recent conservation measures (e.g., annual fishery closures: BFAR 2014) where this species is most heavily targeted (off the Zamboanga Peninsula - Region IX) have resulted in an increase in the local population in recent years (Rola <em>et al.</em> 2018), which suggests this species responds well when regulated. This species is sold fresh and dried at the market. It is also sold canned and as ""bottled sardine.” <em>Sardinella lemuru</em> is primarily caught by bag-net, beach seine, modified Danish seine, drift and bottom-set gillnet, fish corrals, ring-nets, multiple hand-line, purse seine, reel and rod, push net, and trawl.",Marine,"Species-specific conservation measures are in place for this species in parts of its range (e.g., the Philippines). For example, closed fishing seasons have been implemented for sardines (including <em>Sardinella lemuru</em>) in the Philippines since 2011 <span style="""">(BFAR 2014),</span> particularly in the Zamboanga Peninsula (Region IX where the E-value is 0.5), and have proven to be very successfu<span style="""">l (Rola <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). A</span>dditionally, its known geographic range overlaps with multiple existing marine  protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016), such as the Palaui Island  Marine Reserve off the coast of the Philippines. As this species is highly commercially important and targeted, conservation recommendations have been made. For example, in Indonesian waters, the development of policy and stock monitoring programs have been suggested to reduce fishing efforts and avoid catching illegal sizes of this species (Setyohadi <em>et al.</em> 2016, Simbolon <em>et al.</em> 2017). More research and population stock assessments are recommended to better understand the population of this species. Likewise, increased monitoring and regulation of fisheries catches is needed to prevent population decline of this commercially important species.","",,false,false,Global

This species is a protandrous hermaphrodite, spawning periodically in estuarine areas. This species historically had a large, stable population but has suffered from range contractions and population decline due to over-fishing of spawning females as well as environmental degradation. The contraction of this species' geographic range and large decline in its fishery is similar to other tropical clupeids of the genus, including <em>T. toli</em>, <em>T. thibaudeaui</em> and <em>T. reevesii</em>. Currently, only two regions exist in which this species is fished (Riau Province, Sumatra and Sarawak, Malaysia) and catches have significantly declined. Based on its' known distribution and knowledge of available spawning grounds, the area of occupancy (AOO) was estimated to be about 3,000 km².&#160;This species is known from two primary locations (Riau Province, Sumatra and Sarawak, Malaysia) and is threatened by the heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations and a continuing decline of the quality of spawning habitat. No conservation measures are in place for this species at this time, though it has been advised that seasonal fisheries closures be put in place. This species appears extremely susceptible to over-fishing and has been severely impacted by these activities. Given the contraction and continued exploitation of available spawning grounds, and continued degradation of necessary habitat by large scale oil production, and logging activities, this species is, therefore assessed as Near Threatened based on criterion B2ab(iii). Increased and expanded protection and enforcement of fishing regulations, especially during peak spawning aggregations is strongly recommended. <strong><br/></strong><strong></strong>","<em>Tenualosa macrura</em>&#160;is a coastal, marine, pelagic, schooling species. This species moves into rivers to breed and is presumed to have similar biology to <em>T. ilisha </em>although this species likely feeds on larger organisms, due to having fewer gill rakers. Males and females regularly move between the Strait of Malacca (salinity of 28 - 30 ppt) and the spawning grounds of the sheltered straits (salinity of 20 - 28) of the Riau Province on each new and full moon (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1999). Peak spawning in Bengkalis waters takes place between September and November, for 3 - 5 days during peak bright and dark periods each month (Suwarso <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species grows to a maximum standard length of 52 cm (Whitehead 1985). This species is a protandrous hermaphrodite and changes from male to female between 14 and 20 cm (SL) at around 6 months to 1 year of age after the males has spawned (Blaber <em>et al. </em>1999, Allsop and West 2003). Females become sexually mature at around 13 cm and fecundity ranges from 60 000 to 200 000 eggs (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). Almost all individuals in the second year class are female (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). Maximum longevity is estimated to be 2 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999).","The contraction of this species' geographic range and large decline  in its fishery is similar to other tropical clupeids of the genus,  including <em>T. toli</em> (Blaber <em>et al. </em>1996), <em>T. thibaudeaui </em>(Roberts 1993, Navy <em>et al.</em> 2009) and <em>T. reevesii</em> (Wang 1996: Blaber <em>et al. </em>1999). The main threat to this species is exploitation of its spawning grounds (Riau Province, Sumatra and estuaries is Sarawak, Malaysia). Catches for this species have purportedly declined drastically in recent decades as a result of intensive fishing in areas of aggregated spawning females, with most being caught before having the chance to spawn (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1999). It is possible that the protandrous habit of this species has made it vulnerable to overfishing (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). Large scale oil-industry and logging developments have also diminished the estuarine and coastal environments. Individuals of this species were found to have ingested large quantities of sawdust and this likely impacts survival (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Thailand, habitat loss is directly associated with the decline of this species (Vidthayanon 2005).","Limited population information is available for this species, though it has reportedly been declining for decades (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). For example, this species and the sister species, <em>T. toli</em> were included in lucrative fisheries along the east coast of Sumatra until the 1970's (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1999). Catches of this species along the coast declined and became confined only to the Bengkalis region of the Riau Province (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1999). Merta <em>et al. </em>(1999) reported that in the 1950's, population densities were much higher than in the late 1990's (averaging 3 - 57 fish caught per trip).&#160; In Thailand, this species has declined due to loss of habitat (Vidthayanon 2005). <br/><br/>During a research experiment in the Riau Province, Sumatra, 1203  individuals of this species were caught between August 1996 and February  1998 (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). A further 450 were caught between  January 1997 and December 2003 along the South China Sea coasts of  Sarawak, though monthly sampling efforts indicate that this species was relatively rare, when found, and was not found at many localities (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2005). Sarawak is the only locality in Malaysia this species is taken from; In 2015, this species made up about 2,244 tonnes in total catches in 2015 (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2015). <br/><br/>In a more recent study from Sumatra, Suwarso <em>et al.</em> (2017) reported that this species is heavily degraded due to high exploitation in the Riau Province, despite fishery limitations (i.e., seasonal closures). In 2016, there was an increase in effort for this species in Bengkalis but this is due to illegal fishing within closed areas; overall effort for this species is declining (Suwarso <em>et al.</em> 2017). However, this species is still one of the most commonly caught species,  representing roughly 15 % of total gill net fishery catches (Suwarso <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Decreasing,"<em>Tenualosa macrura</em>&#160;is known from Sarawak, Malaysia and Sumatra, Indonesia (Whitehead 1985, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999).

Fishing pressure intensifies in the inshore sheltered straits when this species is present to spawn; large females are targeted and taken most often prior to spawning (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sometimes, juveniles are taken as bycatch in prawn trawl fisheries in the coastal waters of Malacca Strait (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Malaysia, this species is a highly regarded table fish (M.

154801652,195502,Anguilla australis,Near Threatened,,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla australis</em> is a catadromous, semelparous species with multiple life stages, and is assumed to be panmictic.&#160;These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Ideally, the IUCN Red List criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, to silver eels starting their spawning migration, as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but such data sets are rarely available. Analysis conducted on fisheries and monitoring data for glass eels, yellow eels and silver eels were reviewed, although the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List criteria must be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the current best estimate of the population status.</p><p><em>A. australis</em> is found in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and surrounding islands (Ege 1939, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2010). Current fisheries-dependent data is available for both Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, <em>A. australis</em> is most commonly found in Victoria and Tasmania, where it constitutes the majority of fisheries catch at yellow eel and silver eel life stages (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009, VFA 2017). In Victoria, catch was described as having increased from 1978 to 1993, after which declines were observed in western regions between the late 1990s and early 2000s, attributed to “Millennium Drought” reducing harvestable waters (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). Eel fisheries in Victoria and Queensland are highly restricted and are confined to private and a small number of public impoundments stocked with wild-caught juvenile eels solely for grow-out purposes (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012, VFA 2017). This fishery data for adult eels is therefore not representative of wild eels and cannot be used to infer trends for the purpose of a conservation assessment. Also, with no metric of effort, there is increased uncertainty relating to abundance trends inferred from the reported data. In Tasmania, fishing effort data is collected, although it has not yet been reported (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). In New Zealand, reported catch is primarily of yellow eels, as there is no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora, and catch of glass eels is mostly prohibited. The North Island Eel Statistical Areas (ESAs) with available data showed either declines or no trend from when data gathering began in 1990 up to 2002, after which increasing trends in CPUE were observed (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). In the South Island, ESAs with available data showed initial declines in the series prior to the introduction of the Quota Management System (QMS) in 2000, after which CPUE showed an increasing trend (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). </p><p>Fishery-independent data is also available for this species. Recruitment of glass eels to the Waikato River in the North Island of New Zealand appears to have declined within the last 30 years or 1.5 generation lengths (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Sampling in the 2004-05 season found CPUE to have decreased by ~66% since sampling in the 1970s. However, a lack of continuous monitoring, with the most recent sampling only occurring over two years, combined with interannual variability in recruitment, makes drawing conclusions from this data difficult. Regular sampling of glass eels at sites across New Zealand from 1995–2006, showed evidence of increases of <em>A. australis</em> (Jellyman 2012). <em>A. australis</em> elver recruitment data from 1995–2015 in New Zealand has been highly variable, and in some areas shown an increase (Martin and Bowman 2016). The relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it is generally agreed that low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement. A study of size distribution of eels also found <em>A. australis</em> to show a healthy distribution, with larger proportions of small eels being present, compared to larger eels (Jellyman 2012). Records from 1977–2015 collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) (in Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016) found an increase in the occurrence of <em>A. australis </em>over this period, although records were mostly from electrofishing, which may over-represent life stages in stream habitats accessible to this method (Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>There are a variety of documented threats to <em>A. australis</em>, and the life history characteristics of anguillids make them inherently more susceptible to these. In New Zealand, drainage between 1840s to 1970s has caused a reduction of wetland habitat by 85%, and as <em>A. australis</em> shows preference for lower reaches, estuaries and coastal areas, this has resulted in widespread habitat loss for this species (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). Also, flood pumping stations control water levels in lowlands where <em>A. australis</em> is commonly found, which can cause significant mortality to eels when sucked into pump intakes (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Across this species’ range, poor water management, including excessive surface and groundwater use, river channelisation, land clearance, and nutrient run-off, have been, and in some cases, will continue to be, detrimental to this species (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999, PCE 2013, Jellyman 2016). Recurring drought in Victoria has resulted in a significant number of eel deaths – mainly <em>A. australis</em> – from both stock enhanced culture waters and of wild-caught stock. In some lakes, eels have been totally eradicated (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a,b</em>). Rainfall is also predicted to be reduced by 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), and so this threat is likely to continue, if not worsen.</p><p>Based on available information across this species’ range, <em>A. australis</em> has been listed as Near Threatened. There is evidence of historical declines in recruitment - recent data suggests increasing trends in yellow eel, silver eel, and glass eel abundance but this is only over the period of around one generation length. The extent of habitat loss across this species’ range, however, is serious cause for concern. In New Zealand, there has been a significant reduction in wetland habitat, and severe drought conditions in Australia have caused shallow lakes to become hypersaline. As reduced rainfall is predicted in southeastern Australia, this may impact this species in the future. This, coupled with other ongoing threats, such as; mortality of eels at pumping stations, habitat degradation, poor water management, and the potential for increased fishery dependency on <em>A. australis</em> owing to reduced quota of the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, requires a precautionary assessment to be made over the period of three generation lengths. It is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. <a name=""_Hlk4155898"">As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation. </a></p><p>          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers, and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>A. australis </em>is principally a lowland species, inhabiting low lakes, estuaries, river reaches and wetlands, closer to coastal areas (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2006, Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). They have been known to migrate further inland, and it is hypothesised that the extent of <em>A. australis</em> found upstream is more a matter of suitable available, or accessible, habitat rather than migration ability (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the Southern coastal region of New South Wales for example, <em>A. australis</em> can be found in highland montane communities, at elevations greater than 700 m (Gehrke and Harris 2000). There is some overlap between the habitat of <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Arai <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sagar <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jellyman 2012). Habitat preferences for juveniles of both species include shallow (&lt;0.5 m) water, although <em>A. australis</em> prefers slow moving water (&lt;0.5 m/s) (Jellyman 2007, 2012). <em>A. australis</em> adults prefer deep water, still with slow velocity (Jellyman 2007, 2012). Substrate preferences differ between these species, with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> preferring course substrate as opposed to the fine muddy substrate that is preferred by <em>A. australis</em> (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998; Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). <em>A. australis</em> is the smallest growing of the three Australasian species, with a maximum length of 1.1 m, and weighing up to 3 kg (Jellyman 2012). Somatic growth rates of silver <em>A. australis</em> ranges from 14.4 to 56.6 mm/year and in general is faster than the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004). Growth rates of <em>A. australis</em> in New Zealand vary between the North and South Islands (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On the South Island, it is found to take on average 12.8 years to reach the minimum legal size of 220 g, whereas on the North Island it is found to take 5.8 years (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <em>A. australis</em> is a nocturnal feeder, with a diet consisting of benthic macroinvertebrates (Jellyman 1989, Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005), and individuals &gt;50–70 mm being known to be piscivorous (Ryan 1986 in Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jellyman 1989). There is diet overlap between <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, so the main mechanism thought to reduce intraspecific competition between the species is through different habitat preferences (Sagar <em>et al.</em> 2005). <em>A. reinhardtii</em> also shows overlap with <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in life history, although more so with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in ecology (Chisnall 2000).</p><p><em>A. australis </em>is catadromous, residing in continental waters before embarking on a seaward migration to spawn (Graynoth <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Studies using otolith microchemistry have found <em>A. australis </em>to exhibit behavioural plasticity in regard to life history, with an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004). <em>A. australis</em> is shorter lived than <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Age at spawning migration varies depending on growth rates, with males ranging between 5–22 years, at a size of 40–48 cm, and females 9–41 years and 64–80 cm (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although, Boubée <em>et al. </em>(2008) stated <em>A. australis</em> could migrate up to 60 years of age. A review by Jellyman (2007), estimated mean age of silver <em>A. australis </em>females in various regions across the North and South Islands. Values varied from 15 to 40 years, with a mean age across the regions of 23.8, although more data were available for the South Island where growth is slower (Jellyman 2007). Assessment of available data on generation length highlighted that factors such as longitude and latitude, sex and habitat quality can affect this metric. Twenty years was agreed upon after analysis. Crook <em>et al.</em> (2014) investigated environmental cues affecting migration of <em>A. australis </em>by tagging<em> </em>97 yellow eels, 23 of which migrated from freshwater to estuary (Darlots Creek to Fitzroy River estuary system in Victoria) with the others remaining in freshwater. Nocturnal movement was mostly detected, with migration to the estuary occurring year-round but increasing in Southern hemisphere summer months and during high flows. Seaward migration was found to occur from late summer to early autumn, and was influenced primarily by lunar phase, and more weakly correlated with water temperature. Todd (1981) also found lunar phase and increased flow to influence seaward migration in <em>A. australis</em>. </p><p>      </p><p><em>A. australis</em> is assumed to be panmictic, with the genetic structure indicating derivation from a single population (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012; Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although, it has been questioned whether there are exists two sub-populations — <em>A. australis australis </em>in Australia and <em>A. australis schmidtii </em>in New Zealand — that are reproductively isolated with separate spawning locations (Ege 1939, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2008). Like all anguillids, <em>A. australis</em> is believed to be semelparous, spawning only once before death (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). The exact spawning location is currently unknown. It has been proposed to occur either to the west of New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (Pease 2004, Gomon and Bray 2018), between Fiji and Tahiti (Castle 1963, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tesch 2003 in Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) or northeast of Samoa (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001). Spawning location is generally thought to exist within the South Equatorial Current (SEC), after which leptocephali, are likely to be transported in the SEC westward flow to the East Australian Current (EAC) (Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). The EAC transports larvae south to their recruitment areas whilst eastward flow across the Tasman Front would transport other individuals to New Zealand (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is thought that the average larval life for <em>A. australis</em> is six months (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although it has also been proposed leptocephali take 9–10 months to reach New Zealand, in late winter to early summer (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008). In a comprehensive review of data, average larval transport duration was found to be 7–8 months (Jellyman and Briand 2016). The mean size of glass eels of <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">A. australis </em>when they recruit to the New Zealand coast is 59.3 mm (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2004). On reaching estuaries and river mouths, larvae have metamorphosed into glass eels, with subsequent upstream migration of pigmented elvers (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Environmental variables have been shown to affect <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>glass eel migrations. In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, New Zealand glass eels displayed a preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C for migration, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to suppress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). In the Waikato River, North Island, New Zealand, glass eel recruitment was studied (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009). Glass eel migrations were found to be positively correlated with spring tides, particularly at the peak of high tide (Jellyman<em> et al.</em> 2009). Water temperature and discharge were also shown to significantly affect glass eel catch (Jellyman<em> et al. </em>2009).</p><p><em>Note: Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk531771015""><em>Anguilla australis</em></a>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to;&#160;barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood <a name=""_Hlk4165200"">(Jacoby <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015)</a>. It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel numbers. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits&#160;arguably increase the impact of&#160;threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. In comparison to the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>,<em> </em>there is less concern surrounding the status of <em>A. australis</em>, primarily due to its life history; faster growth, and earlier age at seaward migration (PCE 2013). As well as this, the geographic range of <em>A. australis</em> is much larger than that of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em><em> </em>(PCE 2013). Currently, habitat degradation, particularly wetland loss, fragmentation, and effects of drought, are plausibly the most prominent threats to this species (Jellyman 2009).</p><p><em>A. australis</em> is the target of fisheries across its geographic range in both Australia and New Zealand, where it is the primary eel landed in Victoria (2017: 84%) (VFA 2017), Tasmania (2009: ~98.5%) (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009), and New Zealand (2015–16: 81%) (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In Victoria, catch is of elvers for on-growing in stock enhanced culture lakes, and silver eels (“migrating adult eels”) (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). In Tasmania, focus is on yellow eels with some silver eels, commercial catch of glass eels is illegal except for research or stocking purposes (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009). In New Zealand, catch of glass eels is illegal, and therefore catch reports are of yellow and silver eels only, although minimum and maximum weight limits of 220 g and 4 kg, respectively, are currently in place to prevent catch of migrating silver eels (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Due to this, <em>A. australis</em> catch is of yellow females, as male migration occurs before reaching the minimum size, potentially creating a skewed sex ratio in escaping silver eels (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), with the exception of Te Waihora where migratory males under 220 g are also harvested (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). A study by Chisnall (1994) investigated the effects of fishing pressure in the Ahirau stream, an unexploited pastoral stream in Waikato, containing both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. In the unexploited stream, prior to the removal of marketable sized eels, the dominant biomass was large <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, which were found largely within pools. <em>A. australis</em> mainly inhabited shallower, faster flowing areas and were found in greater numbers, although in much smaller sizes, possibly due to territorial behaviour by <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> excluding <em>A. australis</em> from pools (Chisnall 1994). After the initial removal of eels, it was found that <em>A. australis</em> had a greater abundance and penetrated further upstream, and very few <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were caught, including few elvers, showing little recovery and possibly poor recruitment (Chisnall 1994). It was concluded that commercial fishing pressure represents more of a threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> than to <em>A. australis</em>, due to their ease of capture (Chisnall 1994). <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> may have previously dominated eel populations within the Waikato prior to exploitation, which has seemingly reduced the density and biomass of this species (Chisnall 1994). <a name=""_Hlk534971999"">However, in the sites where <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were recruited, interspecific competition favoured <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, and the density and biomass of <em>A. australis</em> was reduced (Chisnall 1994).</a><a name=""_Hlk531769381""></a> <a name=""_Hlk531772049""></a>This study supports the hypothesis that the extent of <em>A. australis</em> found upstream is more a matter of suitable, available, or accessible habitat rather than migration ability (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk531772990"">Habitat degradation poses a threat to <em>A. australis</em> in New Zealand. Since European settlement began in 1840, felling of trees for timber has occurred, along with burning of forests for quick conversion to pasture faming (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). By the 1980s, around 70% of the native forest had been lost (PCE 2013). Topsoil run-off as a result of forest clearing resulted in large scale erosion and sedimentation of rivers, detrimental effects of which are still being seen in the present day (PCE 2013). Although the effects of this are more detrimental to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>—<em> </em>as <em>A. australis</em> prefers soft bottom muddy waters — the reduction of riparian zone compromises the overall health of the river system (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Widespread habitat loss through channel straightening and wetland drainage is a serious problem for <em>A. australis</em>, due to their preferences for lower reaches, coastal areas and estuaries (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005; Jellyman 2009, 2012; PCE 2013). Where wetland drainage still occurs, and where flood pumping stations control water levels, eels can be sucked into pump intakes if they are unscreened (PCE 2013, Vaipuhi Consulting 2017). Impellors spin within the pumps, resulting in 100% mortality to eels greater than 600 mm in length, mostly migrating females; for smaller eels of a size less than 600 mm, it is significantly lower, at 12% (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Impacts of flood pumps may be greater for <em>A. australis</em>, as they are more prevalent in low land areas. </a>The effects of farming irrigation have also been suggested to be detrimental to eels in New Zealand. Poor water quality resulting from greater concentrations of nutrients and sediment in the water has been linked to excessive plant growth and smothering of the stream bed, reducing habitat and food for eels (PCE 2013). The use of drainage for pastoral purposes means there is a requirement for drain cleaning (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). This is most common in low-lying lands and is therefore a threat to <em>A. australis </em>(Jellyman 2012). Methods include both mechanical clearing and herbicides, and personal accounts have reported that mechanical excavation leads to eels being scooped out of the water onto banks, causing direct mortality if they cannot make it back to the watercourse (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). &#160;</p><p>In Australia, poor water management and excessive surface and ground water use has caused river flow reduction, causing consequent negative impacts to biodiversity, increased soil salinity, and contaminant accumulation (Jellyman 2016). In the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, there have been multiple disturbances since European settlement, including clearing 37% of the catchment for land use, abstraction, pollution from run-off and sewage, and mining (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p><p>In Victoria, recurrent drought conditions from 1994 to 2007, have caused declines in the production of both stock-enhanced and wild <em>A. australis </em>(McKinnon 2002)<em>. </em>The wild component of this fishery is based on silver eels (“migrating adult eels”), and during drought periods, when the stock enhanced productivity is low, reliance on the wild component increases (McKinnon 2002). In September 2006, Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) testing was conducted on Lake Martin in Victoria, where it was found that salinity was 25% higher than seawater, and the maximum depth of the lake was 50 cm, as a result of drought (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In another four monitored rivers between spring 2006 and autumn 2007, eel deaths were also related to high salinity and pH conditions (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). In Lake Modewarre, Lake Tooliorook and Lake Bolac, a pH of 9–9.5 and a rise in salinity by 20% per month was a common factor leading to eel deaths (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Drought can also affect eels through increased nutrient input and accumulation resulting in algal blooms and subsequent eutrophication (McKinnon 2002). In southeastern Australia, climate change is projected to result in reduced rainfall, in the order of 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), resulting in reduced streamflow and declining area of freshwater habitat in coastal catchments. Therefore, it seems likely that such lakes will no longer be habitable for eels, resulting in marked reductions in their distribution in mainland Australia.</p><p>The development of hydropower and dams/weirs in New Zealand is also a threat to eels, impeding upstream and downstream migration, and reducing the amount of suitable available habitat (Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boubée <em>et al.</em> 2008, Graynoth <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jellyman 2012). Although <em>A. australis</em> has been found not to travel as far inland as <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, this may still pose a threat to migration (Jellyman 2012). Even with programmes such as trap and transfer, females predominantly reside further upstream, and the inability to complete seaward migration can cause skewed sex ratios during spawning (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005). During downstream migration, mortality of larger eels in hydroelectric turbines can be up to 100%, dependent on turbine speed and type (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Upstream migration of glass eels can also be affected by barriers, and even with the addition of fishways to allow safe passage, the high velocity of flows out of the fishway may restrict glass eel migration (Langdon and Collins 2000). <a name=""_Hlk532459631"">In Australia, dams also pose a threat to eels. An example is Tallowa Dam, found in the Shoalhaven River, in New South Wales. Sampling of fish species at the dam found <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii</em> living immediately below (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). Unlike many other species, <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii</em> were able to pass over the dam, by climbing the spillway wall (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). Despite their ability to climb the wall, the large accumulations of these two species occurring at the base of the dam highlights the effect of barriers on slowing migration, as well as associated density dependent effects; increased risk of predation, potential for over-exploitation through fishing, and increased risk of mortality as a result of disease epidemics occurring in confined habitats (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 2002). </a>Since this time, a high-level fish lift commenced operation on Tallowa Dam in 2009 to reinstate fish passage. By 2014, <em>A. australis</em> were only using the fishway infrequently, compared to <em>A. reinhardtii</em> which passed through the fishway in much larger numbers (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a single individual of <em>A. australis</em> was caught upstream after commissioning the fishway, compared to 185 <em>A. reinhardtii</em>. No <em>A. australis</em> were caught immediately below the dam suggesting that <em>A. australis</em> remains a relatively uncommon species in the Shoalhaven River system (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em></em></p><p>            </p><p>Changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions have been implicated in the decline in recruitment seen in all temperate anguillid species (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). For some species, this involves El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which have potentially been affecting spawning and recruitment of <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009)<em>. </em>Alterations in surface layer characteristics (productivity/community structure) may also have occurred due to ocean warming, affecting both larval feeding and transport (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, New Zealand, glass eels (both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) migrating upstream were found to display preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to supress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). It was therefore implied that warmer waters occurring as a result of the changing climate may be detrimental to glass eel recruitment in the native range of these species (August and Hicks 2008). In the North Island Waikato River, glass eel recruitment (both <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) was also studied over a period of two years (2004–05) (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Comparison of catch results from this study with previous catch data (30 years apart), found glass eel migration periods to occur earlier in the present study, by several weeks (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). It was also found that reduced CPUE and duration of runs in the recent sampling, indicating a reduction in recruitment may also have occurred (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). One possible explanation given, was that deviations were a result of climate change, as although no consistent national trend exists, fresh water temperatures in New Zealand have increased by ~1.6°C from 1989-2005 (Scarsbrook 2006 in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). <a name=""_Hlk531353491"">Glass eels sampled by Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2009) were caught between temperatures of 12.6</a>°C and 13.1°C, substantially below the 16.5°C optimum suggested by August and Hicks (2008). There was also evidence that glass eels may compensate for increased temperature through earlier seasonal migration (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Therefore, if they were to wait for river temperatures &gt;12°C before beginning upstream migration, the time window would become limited (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). For these studies, catches in both the Tukituki and Waikato were both predominantly <em>A. australis</em>, 91–93% and &gt;97%, respectively (August and Hicks 2008, Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a>In&#160;</a>New Zealand, there is less concern over the population of <em>A. australis</em> than the sympatric <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015)<em>. </em>The most recent data available from New Zealand is from the Fisheries New Zealand Fisheries Assessment Plenary, published in May 2018. This document is a summary of fisheries, biological, environmental, stock assessment, and stock status information for commercial fish species in New Zealand. The first available catch data (landings, tonnes (t)) of yellow, and to a lesser extent, silver eels, is from 1965, although up to 1989–90 this encompassed landings of both shortfin <em>(A. australis)</em> and longfin (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>), with the latter making up ~25% of commercial eel catch (PCE 2013). Although not a legislative requirement, there are no targeted fisheries for silver eels - with the exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora) in New Zealand (Jellyman 2007). This is due to capture being difficult at high flow periods when most migrate, and voluntary bans among fishers to support the sustainability of the stock (Jellyman 2007). Australasian longfin (<em>A. reinhardtii</em>), after identification in 1996 (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 1996), has been confirmed in North Island landings, although the percentage is unknown and thought to contribute very little, so is included and managed within ‘shortfin’ (<em>A. australis</em>) stocks. Catch data prior to 1988 was also collected by calendar year not fishing season, which straddle years. Fisheries New Zealand (2018) reports landings (t) of both ‘shortfin’ and ‘longfin’ from 1989–90 to 2015–16. In 1989–90, landings of ‘shortfin’ eels totalled 617 t, in 2015–16 this decreased to 378 t, a decline of ~39%. However, the effects of market demand, quotas, voluntary non-targeting, and fishery closures (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017), mean it would not be accurate to infer population declines solely from the landings data presented within the Fisheries Assessment Plenary.</p><p>Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data is available for New Zealand by Eel Statistical Area (ESA), a list of which can be found in Fisheries New Zealand (2018). For North Island ESAs — not including Wellington (ESA AM), due to lack of data — from 1990–91 to 2014–15, CPUE for ‘shortfin’ (<em>A.australis</em> with small proportion of <em>A. reinhardtii</em>) showed either declines or no trend up to 2002, after which it increased (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). For Northland (ESA AA), CPUE did not show the declines, and exhibited a steady increase throughout the series (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). Increased CPUE is suggested to have occurred as a result of the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) reductions in 2007–08 as well as voluntary reductions in Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) by iwi&#160;—&#160;the political unit of the Māori representing customary and commercial interests&#160;—&#160;prior to this. Estimates of CPUE are described as being conservative following 2007 due to non-reporting of legal sized eels returned to the water, a consequence of fishers not having enough ACE to cover the catch, but also voluntarily forgoing opportunities to fulfil their ACE (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). The increased size of fyke net escape tubes — a <a name=""_Hlk3295968"">mechanism to allow eels under the size restriction to escape —</a> from 25 mm to 31 mm in 2013–14 to exclude eels &lt;300 g will also have contributed to these conservative estimates (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017).</p><p>Analysis of CPUE has also been conducted for South Island ESAs from 1990–91 to 2012–13 (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). In data poor areas (Nelson (ESA AN), Marlborough, South Marlborough (ESAs AP-AQ), North and South Canterbury (ESA AR, AT), and Waitaki (ESA AU)) prior to the Quota Management System (QMS), there were indications of a declining trend between 1991–2000, most prominently in Marlborough and South Marlborough (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). For areas in which there was more data (Westland (ESA AX), Otago (ESA AV), Southland (ESA AW) and Te Waihora (AS1)), CPUE showed initial declines in Otago and Southland prior to the QMS, and in Westland this decline was followed by an increase (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). After the introduction of the QMS in 2000, there was an increase in CPUE for all ESAs, but this was most prominent in Southland and Te Waihora (Beentjes and Dunn 2013).</p><p>Records from 1977–2015 collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) were analysed by Crow <em>et al</em>. (2016) using a generalised linear model, to estimate the probability of capture as an index of relative abundance for each year of record. Two analyses were carried out, one using probability of capture values only, and one that was weighted,&#160;through placing higher emphasis on observations for which there is greater confidence.&#160;Within all analyses, both weighted and unweighted, across the whole time series, and only using data from 1995–2015, occurrence of <em>A. australis</em> increased. The data within NZFFD records are collected country-wide, possibly suggesting country-wide trends, however, records were mostly from electrofishing which may over-represent life stages in stream habitats accessible to this method (Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>In Australia, Victoria is the main area for fishing <em>A. australis</em>. The Victorian Eel Fishery uses both wild caught and stock enhanced commercial catch, whereby eel production through stock enhancement involves catch of elvers and on-growing in ‘culture’ lakes under natural conditions (McKinnon 2002, VFA 2017). This method comprises 40% of the commercial catch, the rest being wild catch of silver eels (“migrating adult eels”) (McKinnon 2002).&#160;Fishery data from 1978–2016 is reported as annual catch with no metric of effort and consists of both wild caught and stock enhanced eels (yellow/silver) (VFA 2017). <em>A. australis</em> represents 84% of catch over the period 1978–2016, with the other 16% consisting of <em>A. reinhardtii</em> (VFA 2017). Catch generally increased from 1978 to 1993, after which declines observed in western regions during the late 1990s, and early 2000s were attributed to the “Millennium Drought” affecting fishery viability, particularly of ‘culture’ waters but also wild caught stocks (VFA 2017). In Tasmania, the eel fishery reports catch of yellow and silver eels, largely focussing on <em>A. australis</em>. Fishing effort data is collected although has “not yet been analysed and reported” (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). Activity is closely linked to the market and so fishers will not fish if prices are too low to attain commercial benefit, and fishing effort is also affected by drought, with expected higher CPUE occurring when drought conditions concentrate eels, creating more efficient fishing (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). The Queensland Eel Fishery combines catch of yellow and silver (&gt;30 cm) <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. reinhardtii, </em>although primarily <em>A. reinhardtii</em> (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012)<em>. </em>CPUE for this fishery showed a steep decline from just under 160 kg/day in 2004, to around 30 kg/day in 2007. From 2007–2012, CPUE has remained constant at just over 30 kg/day. Since 2012, CPUE has increased up to ~40 kg/day in 2017, 2016 was an exception to this, with only 25 kg/day (Daf.qld.gov.au 2018). Harvest of yellow and silver eels in the Queensland Eel Fishery is from “artificial impoundments” where juvenile eels have been stocked for grow-out purposes, CPUE is therefore stated to be “not representative of wild adult eel stocks” (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). Stock status for this fishery is described as “sustainably fished” (owing to “strict conditions related to permitted fishing areas”) (Queensland Government 2010, Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). In New South Wales, catch of eels is primarily (90%) <em>A. reinhardtii</em>, with reports of landings combining this with <em>A. australis </em>(Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indices of CPUE are calculated for this fishery, which remained stable from 1997–98 to 2008–09 before a slight increase from 2008–09 to 2011–12 and subsequent decline to 2013–14 (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2015). Whilst some reports describe <em>A. australis</em> as being abundant in New South Wales coastal rivers (Beumer 1996), intensive quantitative surveys found this species to be relatively uncommon in the southern coastal region, with only a single individual caught in the northern coastal region (Harris and Gehrke 1997). </p><p>Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2009) provided the first strong indication that recruitment of <em>A. australis</em> glass eels had declined in the Waikato River in New Zealand. When comparing sampling of <em>Anguilla </em>spp<em>.</em> (both <em>A. australis</em> (97%) and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (3%)) during 2004–05 to previous sampling in the 1970s, CPUE (kg / net h) had declined by ~66% over ~30 years, from 5.80 ± 1.25 in the 1970s, to 1.99 ± 0.96 in 2004–05. However, conclusions based on two years' data must be provisional, as interannual variation in recruitment can be 10-fold (Francis and Jellyman 1999, in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). As part of a Public Good Science Fund (PGSF) research programme on eels, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand conducted regular sampling for glass eels (Jellyman 2012). The data series ran from 1995 to 2006, and analysis was conducted on glass eel catches sampled at two weekly intervals during September and October (Jellyman 2012). The analysis found <em>A. australis</em> glass eel density increased over the sampling period, and also was greater than that of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em><em>, </em>(Jellyman 2012). However, the time period assessed in this paper is relatively short in comparison to generation length (20 years), and other studies (Jellyman <em>et al.</em> 2009) have found evidence of recruitment declines (Jellyman 2012). Since 1995, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been monitoring recruitment through elver trap and transfer operations at hydro dams. Martin and Bowman (2016), estimated recruitment trends between 1995 and 2015, using the data collected from six locations: Wairua Falls Power Station, Karapiro Dam, Matahina Dam, Patea Dam, Waitaki Dam and Arnold Dam. Trends in catch indices are largely variable, although in Karapiro and Matahina, for both <em>A. dieffenbachi</em> and <em>A. australis</em>, catch peaked between 2007 and 2009, underwent a sharp decline in 2011–12, before again increasing in 2014–15. In the South Island, there were large gaps in data, making it difficult to discern trends. Arnold Dam showed declines from 2007–08, although increased in 2014–15. When investigating size distribution of eels, Jellyman (2012) found a healthy distribution for <em>A. australis</em> consisting of a larger proportion of small eels (50–99 mm, 100–149 mm) being present, compared to larger eels. </p><p>Wetland drainage has resulted in a huge loss of habitat for <em>A. australis </em>in New Zealand (Jellyman 2016). Since European settlement in the 1840s, to the mid-1970s, lowland wetlands have been progressively drained, resulting in a reduction from around 670,000 ha to 100,000 ha (85%) (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al.</em> 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). The wetland areas that remain have been subject to other stressors, such as pollution, animal grazing and introduced plants (Taylor and Smith 1997). Droughts occurring in Victoria have also been linked to declines in both wild-caught and stock-enhanced <em>A. australis </em>(McKinnon 2002). Western region declines in catch from 1990–2000 were attributed to the drought conditions reducing areas of harvest, particularly in stock enhanced culture waters (VFA 2017). Although, with no metric of effort within this series, it is difficult to validate this. In 1999, in Lake Gnarpurt, western Victoria, an algal bloom resulting from drought conditions killed an estimated 100 t of eels (McKinnon 2002). In the summers of 2004–05 and 2005–06, there were records of severe cases of eel deaths in the Western District of Victoria (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In 2004–05, ten waterways recorded eel deaths, although fewer than 100 eels each time. In January of 2005, there was 5000 recorded dead eels in Lake Modewarre. A repeat event occurred in January and February 2006, with 20 t — estimated to be 50,000 individuals — of dead eels recorded, and there is now said to be “doubts amongst commercial fishers whether there are any eels surviving in this lake, let alone commercially viable quantities” (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). In Lake Bolac, another large eel death event was recorded in January 2006 of 5000 eels, and in February 2006 more than 200 dead eels were observed on the shore of Lake Martin (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). A monitoring programme running from spring 2006 to autumn 2007 was conducted in four lakes (Lake Modewarre, Lake Colac, Lake Tooliorook, and Lake Bolac), of these, two large eel deaths occurred in lakes that support commercial eel fishing (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). From late November to early December 2006, it was estimated that in Lake Tooliorook, 75,000 eels died, and in Lake Bolac, the largest of the deaths, an estimated 95,000 eels, was recorded in March 2007 (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Following these events, it was considered unlikely that any eels remained within these two lakes by the end of autumn 2007 (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Eels were believed to remain in Lake Colac, thought to be the last large inland lake eel population, the retention of which was dependent on future drought conditions (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>b</em>). Eel deaths occurring in the western lakes were mostly comprised of large females said to be in “good condition” (Leahy <em>et al</em>. 2007<em>a</em>). <em>A. reinhardtii</em> may also comprise some of the biomass in these events, although this species isn’t as common in Victoria as <em>A. australis&#160;</em>(VFA 2017). Drought has continued in Victoria, and although re-stocking took place in 2016, this was of mostly rainbow and brown trout (Tagried Kurwie pers. comm. 2019). In southeastern Australia, climate change is projected to result in reduced rainfall, in the order of 19–25% by 2090 (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology 2016), resulting in reduced streamflow and declining area of freshwater habitat in coastal catchments. Therefore, it seems likely that such lakes will no longer be habitable for eels, resulting in marked reductions in their distribution in mainland Australia.</p><p>Under the New Zealand Threat Classification Series,<em> A. australis </em>has been assessed as ‘Not Threatened’ (species with large stable populations), with qualifier ‘Inc’ for increasing (Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2018). The New Zealand Threat Classification Series defines population as “The total number of individuals that are resident or that breed in New Zealand” referring solely to mature individuals (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). For a ‘Not Threatened’ taxon, there must be 20,000–100,000 or &gt;100,000 mature individuals, and the population trend must be stable (±10%) or increasing (&gt;10%) (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). The qualifier ‘Inc’ refers to an ongoing or predicted increase of &gt;10% in the total population taken over the next 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is longer (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). The difficulty with assessing an anguillid species using this terminology, as with the IUCN classification, is that there is no direct metric for ‘mature individuals’, as eels are not considered mature until they reach breeding grounds to spawn. Therefore, it is necessary to assess them using a suitable alternative metric (for example, silver eel escapement/glass eel recruitment). Within the New Zealand Threat Classification Series assessment, there is no indication as to what metric was used or reasoning as to why that metric was decided to be an appropriate alternative.</p>      <p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Anguilla australis</em>, is a temperate eel (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004) found in New Zealand, eastern Australia, Tasmania, Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, New Caledonia (Ege 1939) and the Chatham islands (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is most abundant in latitudes 35–44<sup>o</sup>S, although is distributed 20–54<sup>o</sup>S (Beumer and Sloane 1990, Shiao <em>et al</em>. 2002). <em>A. australis</em> mostly inhabits lowlands, dominating lakes, estuaries, low river reaches and wetlands (Jellyman 2007, 2012; PCE 2013). Upper altitudes occur at around 250 m southwest of the North Island of New Zealand around Mt. Ruapehu, with occasional records higher (&gt;400–500 m) (GBIF 2018). In the Southern coastal region of New South Wales, <em>A. australis</em> is a characteristic species of montane rivers at elevations above 700 m (Gehrke and Harris 2000). The precise spawning location for <em>A. australis</em> is unknown, although it is thought to occur to the west of New Caledonia in the Coral Sea (Pease 2004, Gomon and Bray 2018), it has also been proposed to lie between Fiji and Tahiti (Castle 1963, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tesch 2003 in Kuroki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) or northeast of Samoa (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001). It is assumed that this species is panmictic, utilising a single spawning ground (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012; Fisheries New Zealand, 2018), although it has been questioned whether there are two sub-populations with separate spawning areas (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><sup></sup>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from juvenile to adult, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 t), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is&#160;<em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other&#160;<em>Anguilla</em>&#160;spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018). Catch or export of glass eels from New Zealand is not permitted (apart from small quantities for research purposes), and where catch of juvenile eels is permitted in Australia, they may not be exported and can only be sold to aquaculture operations within Australia, of which there are currently very few. However, based on East Asian Customs data, Hong Kong reported imports of 1761 kg of live eel fry from Australia in 2014–2015 and Korea 180 kg in 2015–2016, suggesting there may be some illegal trade/demand for either&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>or&#160;<em>A. reinhardtii&#160;</em>juvenile eels, despite there being no information that these species are currently used in eel farms in East Asia (Gollock&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of&#160;<em>Anguilla&#160;</em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter (52% and 71% of global exports by weight and value respectively during 2006–2015) and Japan the main importer (for 54% and 72%). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;Trade in&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>on the other hand is predominantly in wild or stocked eels.</p><p>In New Zealand, eels <a name=""_Hlk3450730"">(known in Te Reo as “tuna”) </a>feature extensively in <a name=""_Hlk3450666"">Māori</a> mythology and large eels are considered spiritual guardians of waterways. &#160;<a name=""_Hlk3450748"">To this day, eels are important to Māori for cultural reasons. In some cases, they are considered a delicacy and are served at various functions. </a>Prior to European settlement, Māori already had extensive knowledge of the ecology of eels and developed effective fisheries through combinations of traps, spearing, bait fishing and large weirs (McDowall 1990, 2011; Jellyman, 2012). The extent of current or past non-commercial take in New Zealand is unknown, however current allowances for customary and recreational take of shortfin eels (<em>A. australis</em>) <a name=""_Hlk3450790"">as of 2018 were set at: 15.2% of TAC (74 t) in the North Island, and 19.9% of TAC (65 t) in South Island, for customary take. For recreational take, allowances were 13% of TAC (63 t) in the North island, and 2.9% of TAC (9.4 t) in the South Island (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>).</a> </p><p>Large scale commercial yellow and silver eel fisheries of domestic species began in New Zealand in the 1960s with the arrival of Dutch immigrants to New Zealand, who had both the knowledge of eel fisheries and the ability to make and use fyke nets (McDowall 1990). The fishery grew rapidly until annual catches of 2000 t were recorded in the early 1970s. Annual landings were relatively stable from 1983 to 2001 (~1000–1500 t), after which they dropped as eel stocks were progressively introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS), TACCs were reduced and international demand declined (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Over the last decade, total commercial annual catch has ranged between about 450–750 t.&#160;<em>A.&#160;australis</em>&#160;catch has accounted for around 70–80% of this: ranging between ~370 and 520 t a year (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the early 1990s, there were 23 licensed eel processing factories operating in New Zealand,&#160;in 2012 there were only 4 or 5 remaining (Jellyman 2012).&#160;</p><p>The majority of New Zealand eel catch (&gt;70%) is exported, with the main domestic consumption being by Māori customary fishers (<a name=""_Hlk3821292"">New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries</a> 2018).&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;eels between 500 g and 1 kg are often exported live; according to industry sources, this is to ensure freshness, and to sell in markets and restaurants that specialise in providing live fish in tanks for selection by customers (New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries 2018). According to New Zealand Customs data (which does not differentiate between eel species), New Zealand exported 3,636 t of frozen eels and 2,818 t of live eels during 2008–2017. Annual frozen eel exports ranged between 152 and 380 t during 2008–2017 except for 2010 when these exceeded 1,189 t with sudden increases in frozen eel exports to South Korea (926 t). Except in 2010, the main destinations of frozen eels were Belgium, the UK and Germany. Live eel exports reached a peak of 517 t in 2011, after which they declined gradually to 133 t in 2016. The main destinations of live eels were South Korea until 2013, mainland China (2014–2016) and Canada in 2017. Jellyman (2012) reported that there has been a substantial increase in the price that New Zealand eels are fetching on overseas markets, although details are scarce.</p><p>Freshwater eels have a long history as a food source throughout their range in eastern Australia, firstly as part of the subsistence diet of aboriginal people (for whom eels also have a strong cultural significance) and then as a commercial fishery developed by European settlers since the early 1900s (Pease 2004). Due to its more temperate distribution,&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;dominates&#160;commercial catches in Victoria and Tasmania (McKinnon 2002, DEPI 2013). Take by recreational and indigenous fisheries is expected to be low: a Queensland state-wide recreational fishing survey undertaken in 2010 indicated that recreational take of eels was approximately 2000 adult eels per year. Australia started reporting eel farming production to FAO in 1984. After reaching peaks of 315 t in 1997 and 1998, farming production has steadily declined, and none has been reported since 2012 (FAO 2018).</p><p><br/> In Victoria,&#160;<em>A. australis&#160;</em>is the most abundant and predominately fished eel species, making up approximately 80% of the total annual catch of eels in Australia (Baker 2010). The first commercial catches of eels in Victoria were recorded in 1914 and until the 1950s the commercial eel fishery was based on supplying bait to the rock lobster and long-line shark fisheries (export of<em>&#160;A. australis</em>&#160;to Europe commenced only in the early 1960s). Four of the life stages (glass eels, elvers, yellow eels and silver eels) are commercially utilized in Victoria, but a major component of the Victorian commercial eel fishery consists of adult eels at various stages of migration (Baker 2010). Yellow and silver eels are commercially fished for domestic and export markets and glass eels and elvers are used for stock enhancement and aquaculture (Baker 2010). Catch of glass eels has been found to have been of “limited success due to the highly variable abundance in Victoria” and currently there is no on-growing occurring in intensive aquaculture facilities in the state (VFA 2017).</p><p>In Tasmania,&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;makes up ~98.5% of the catch (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009). The commercial fishery in Tasmania is based on the harvest of eels larger than 300 mm in length. Fishing activity in Tasmania has been shown to be heavily influenced by eel price and market demand: eel fishers will cease or reduce fishing effort if eel prices are too low prohibited (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009).&#160;Interest in eel culture has led to periodic aquaculture trials but has not progressed into commercial development. Other glass eel catch is carried out for research or stocking purposes at sites where barriers impede natural migration, but commercial fishing of glass eels is prohibited (Inland Fisheries Authority Tasmania 2009).&#160;</p><p>Fishing for&#160;<em>A. australis</em>&#160;also occurs in Queensland and New South Wales, although is not the main focus of these fisheries.&#160;<em>A. australis </em>makes up around 10% of the catch in the New South Wales Estuary General Fishery (Pease 2004). Aquaculture of eels also exists in New South Wales, although production is small, and a precautionary approach is being taken with respect to glass eel harvest (Dpi.nsw.gov.au 2018<em>b</em>).</p><p>                    </p><p>There is a limited domestic market for eels in Australia,&#160;and most is exported to Asia (live) and Europe (frozen) (<a name=""_Hlk3821400"">Australian Department of the Environment and Energy 2018</a>). According to UN Comtrade, Australia exported 2,635 t of eel commodities (all species) during 2007–2016, 91% of which were live eel exports. Live eel exports reached a peak of ~370 t in 2012, after which they gradually decreased to 96 t in 2016. Hong Kong was the dominant destination of live eels from Australia, accounting for 84% of live eel exports from the country between 2007 and 2016.<strong></strong></p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>There has been previous debate over the taxonomic status of <em>A. australis</em>, with some suggesting the possibility of two sub-species. This debate has led to questions over whether there should be separate management for each sub-species (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2006, Shen and Tzeng 2007, Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012). Jellyman (2007), stated that they are found to show genetic homogeneity at the glass eel stage, and should therefore be managed cooperatively by Australia and New Zealand as if it were a single population. Currently, management of <em>A. australis</em> is independent across Australian states and New Zealand.</p><p>In Australia, fisheries target both the shortfin eel (<em>Anguilla australis</em>) and the Australian longfin eel (<em>Anguilla reinhardtii</em>). The Victorian Eel Fishery is managed in accordance with the&#160;<em>Fisheries Act 1995</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Fisheries Regulations 2009</em> (VFA 2018). The latest Victorian Eel Fishery Management Plan was published in 2017, which sets out management arrangements, objectives, strategies and actions of the fishery for the next five years (VFA 2017). Victoria does not operate closed seasons for the commercial harvest of eels (VFA 2017). The Tasmanian Eel Fishery is managed in accordance with the <em>Inland Fisheries Act 1995 </em>and<em> Inland Fisheries Regulations 1996</em> (Australian Government 2004). A management plan does not exist for this fishery, although the latest assessment was published in 2016 (Australian Government 2016). The fishery is managed through gear restrictions, geographically defined licencing, closed catchments and significant protection of glass eels/elvers and migrating silver eels (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). The Queensland Eel Fishery management regime falls under the <em>Fisheries Act 1994</em>, <em>Fisheries Regulation 2008</em>, <em>Policy for Management Arrangements for the Commercial Harvesting and use of Juvenile Eels</em> (The Juvenile Eel Policy), and <em>Integrated Planning Act 1997</em> (for juveniles harvested for aquaculture) (Department of Fisheries, Agriculture and Forestry 2012). The Queensland fishing season runs from 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December, and the latest assessment of the fishery under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em> was published in 2014 which includes a summary of issues and recommendations (Australian Government 2014). The eel fishery in Queensland is a closed fishery, with non-transferrable licences. For New South Wales, harvest of eels occurs as part of the Estuary General Fishery (multi-species), under the enforcement legislation: NSW <em>Fisheries Management (Estuary General Share Management Plan) Regulation 2006</em>, NSW <em>Fisheries Management Act 1994</em>, NSW <em>Fisheries Management (General) Regulation 2010</em>, and NSW <em>Fisheries Management (Supporting Plan) Regulation 2006 </em>(Australian Government 2018, Dpi.nsw.gov.au. 2018<em>a</em>)<em>. </em>An assessment for this fishery under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em> (EBPC act) was conducted in 2018, depicting where the fishery meets or does not meet the guidelines set out by the EPBC act (Australian Government 2018).</p><p>Fishways are used in Australia to mitigate the impact of obstructions to fish passage (Jones and O’Connor 2017). The <em>Victorian Waterway Management Strategy </em>(VWMS) is a framework for waterway management, covering the maintenance and improvement of water conditions (DEPI 2013, Jones and O’Connor 2017). &#160;Policies within this framework look at improving connectivity, and therefore relate to eel passage (Jones and O’Connor 2017). New South Wales manages fish passage under the <em>NSW</em> <em>Fisheries Management Act 1994</em>, whereby all new structures must consider fish passage, and the restoration of old structures that require a method of fish passage occurs (Thorncraft and Harris 2000). Concerns over a growing urban population in Sydney, and the construction of dams in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment to supply water to the Sydney metropolitan area, led to the enactment of the <em>Water Board Corporatisation Act 1994</em>, that required the Sydney Water Corporation to protect the aquatic environment through more sustainable practises, including the installation and commissioning of a high-level fishway on Tallowa Dam (Gehrke <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Tasmania, fish ladders have been installed to promote fish passage. An elver ladder was built at the Trevallyn Dam in 1996, although the ladder has now been de-commissioned, and other improvements made for passage of elvers (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). Hydro Tasmania reports it “is continuing to examine options to mitigate the impacts of dam and power generation infrastructure on spawning migrations of silver eels” (Inland Fisheries Service Tasmania 2009). <a name=""_Hlk3304537"">West of New South Wales, on Tallowa Dam in Shoalhaven River, a high-level fish lift commenced operation in 2009 (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>By 2014, <em>A. australis</em> were only using the fishway infrequently, compared to <em>A. reinhardtii</em> which passed through the fishway in much larger numbers (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a single individual of <em>A. australis</em> was caught upstream after commissioning the fishway, compared to 185 <em>A. reinhardtii </em>(Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2014). </p><p>In New Zealand, there is an annual meeting of the Eel Working Group focusing on eel fisheries management. This involves the Ministry of Fisheries fishery managers, the iwi&#160;—&#160;political unit of the Māori representing customary and commercial interests&#160;—&#160;commercial fishers, processers, the Seafood Industry Council, the Department of Conservation and research providers (Jellyman 2012). The meetings involve discussions surrounding research priorities, reviewing research outcomes and reviewing the annual report on eels (Ministry of Fisheries assessment plenary) (Jellyman 2012).</p><p>The New Zealand fishing season for all eel stocks extends from 1<sup>st</sup> October to 30<sup>th</sup> September, apart from Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere, where since 2002 the season is 1<sup>st</sup> February to 31<sup>st</sup> January (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <a name=""_Hlk3450913"">A Quota Management System (QMS) was introduced to New Zealand in 1986, to control the amount of fish taken from each stock (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2019<em>a</em>). </a>On 1<sup>st</sup> October 2000, the South Island eel fishery was introduced to the QMS, combining ‘shortfins’ (<em>A. australis </em>with some <em>A</em>.<em> reinhardtii</em>) and ‘longfins’ (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) within six stocks. The Chatham Island fishery followed, introducing the QMS on the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2003, with one stock for ‘shortfins’ and one for ‘longfins’. The North Island fishery was introduced on the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2004, <a name=""_Hlk534986305"">with eight fish stocks, four for each ‘shortfins’ and ‘longfins’ </a>(Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On 1<sup>st</sup> October 2017 the South Island stocks were finally separated into ‘longfins’ and ‘shortfins’, to allow species specific management (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk3450942"">The QMS involves establishing Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (In 2018: 327.59 t South Island, 486 t North Island) for each fish stock, which is split into: Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) (In 2018: 77% of TAC (252.1 t) South Island, 69.3% of TAC (337 t) North Island),&#160; customary catch, recreational catch, and other sources of fishing related mortality (Jellyman 2007, 2012). New Zealand’s indigenous people, Māori, have been allocated 20% of commercial quota, with additional catch allocation for customary take (Jellyman 2007, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Quota shares generate a certain amount of Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE), which does not necessarily have to be fished by owners themselves and can be sold to other licensed fishers that may or may not own quota. The proportion of the TAC given as customary allowance is different for both North and South Islands and can vary in different years as a result of adjustments made after reviews. The current customary allowance for the North Island is 15.2% of the TAC (74 t) after cuts to the TAC/TACC were made on 1<sup>st</sup> October 2018, although this varies within each Quota Management Area (QMA) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>b</em>). In the South Island the customary allowance is 19.8% of TAC (65 t), with the proportion again varying by QMA (values for TAC, TACC, cust. allowance, and rec. allowance for each North and South Island QMA can be found: Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019<em>c</em>).</a></p><p>Minimum and maximum commercial size limits (220 g from 1992 and 4 kg from 1995 for South Island and 2007 for North Island) are in place for anguillid eels throughout New Zealand (Jellyman 2012). <a name=""_Hlk3450982"">The minimum size limit effectively excludes male shortfins, and so the fishery targets female yellow eels (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). </a>In 2005, Mohaka, Motu and most of the Whanganui River catchments were closed to commercial fishing (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the Waikato-Tainui rohe region in 2014, bylaws were introduced to limit minimum harvest sizes to 300 g for ‘shortfins’ and 400 g for ‘longfins’, with an upper limit of 2 kg for both (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), to prevent the take of migratory females. There is now no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of seaward migrating <em>A. australis</em> males under 220 g from Te Waihora (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). There was also the addition of seasonal closures in some reaches as a result of the introduced bylaws (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Across New Zealand, there also exists a recreational daily bag limit of six eels, introduced in October 1994 (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). <a name=""_Hlk3297509"">Commercial fishing in New Zealand is also banned in National Parks and Scenic Reserves, and often on the Crown Estate (managed by the Department of Conservation).</a> In April 2018, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Department of Conservation developed the “New Zealand fish passage guidelines: for structures up to 4 m” in partnership with the New Zealand Fish Passage Advisory Group (Doc.govt.nz 2018, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 2018). The document outlines recommended practice for the design of instream infrastructure to provide for general fish passage and sets foundations for improved fish passage management, making some reference to eels specifically (Doc.govt.nz 2018, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 2018). Other management measures have included enhancement of upstream waters with juvenile eels although where this takes place upstream of hydro dams, escapement still remains an issue; setting aside additional reserve areas to increase escapement of silver eels; and increased management involvement of Māori (Jellyman 2007). </p><p>              </p><p>Since 1982/3 assistance of upstream elver passage over hydro-dams has occurred in New Zealand, and ‘trap and transfer’ methods are used to help improve the state of eel populations above these structures (Boubée <em>et al.</em> 2008). Lake Manapouri in the Waiau River catchment operates the largest hydropower station in New Zealand (Jellyman and Unwin 2018). To provide safe downstream passage egress for silver eels, Meridian Energy Ltd. - the power company responsible for the Manapouri Lake Control structure - are required to operate a ‘trap and transfer’ and monitoring programme, whereby silver eels are caught in the lake and transferred downstream of the obstruction to allow access to the sea (Jellyman and Unwin 2018, Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2018). Methods allowing for downstream movement include netting eels in headraces, and opening spillway gates at critical times, such as at the Patea Dam in Taranaki, where spillway gates are opened for an hour after sunset following heavy rain when mature eels are likely to migrate (PCE 2013). Māori have also practised various forms of management, named “rāhui”, which has included imposing fishing bans on waterways for ceremonial or conservation reasons and seeding areas with small eels (Jellyman 2012).</p><p></p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

It is commercially exploited throughout its range and the largest abundance is distributed on the northern Pacific coast of Japan. In Russian waters, the population of this species has had an increasing trend over the past three generations, except in Peter the Great Bay where the density of this species declined by about 25% over the past three generations (since 2003). The Tokyo Bay stock experienced an abundance decline of 83% from the late 1980s to mid-2000s, and the stock in the Ise and Mikawa bays area has also declined. The western Aomori (Japan) stock also declined in the 1980s and 1990s. On the northern Pacific coast of Japan in the Tohoku region, the stock of this species significantly increased over the past three generations (since 2003). In the Seto Inland Sea, the stock has declined by over 90% since the late 1990s and is at a critically low level in part due to recruitment overfishing. However, over the past three generations (since 2003), catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined by about 50%. It is also a highly-valued component of flatfish catches throughout Chinese and Korean waters. Species-specific data are limited or not available, but flatfish stocks in those countries have been in decline and overfished since the 1980s. In addition to overfishing, this species is negatively impacted by coastal development and pollution in the shallow, nearshore and estuarine habitats utilized by juveniles. Based on these data, and inferring that ~50% of the global population occurs on the northern Pacific coast of Japan and in Russian waters where stocks are stable or increasing, this species has undergone a suspected global-level decline of nearly 30% over the past three generations. As this decline is close to meeting the quantitative threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion&#160;A2bcd, this species is listed as Near Threatened. Stronger fisheries management measures are needed to improve the status of this species throughout most of its range. Additionally, the impacts of anthropogenic changes on juvenile habitats require further monitoring and quantification.&#160;<br/><br/><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</span>","This demersal species inhabits sandy mud bottoms of estuaries, and those on the continental shelf and upper slope (Nakabo 2013, Parin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The maximum standard length is 46.3 cm (Tomiyama 2013). It spawns in shallow, coastal waters, including bays and estuaries and migrates to deeper waters in the summer (Mitamura <em>et al. </em>2020). Eggs are attached to the substrate and juveniles settle in shallow, sandy habitats (Sato <em>et al</em>. 2018). This species has a relatively low dispersal ability compared with those of other species in the Pleuronectidae&#160;(Minegishi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Longevity is estimated to be 10-12 years (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2009a) and age at first sexual maturity for males is 2 years and 2-3 years for females (Kume <em>et al. </em>2006, Hwang<em> et al. </em>2017, Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). Mature 1-year old individuals (both male and female) have been observed in the Seto Inland Sea (Tanda <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;The natural mortality is estimated&#160;to be 0.31 (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). The generation length, based on the equation 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, is estimated to be about 6 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species throughout much of its range. Degradation of the shallow, coastal and estuarine habitats upon which it is dependent has also occurred in some areas, due to heavy coastal development and pollution from runoff (Sato&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Park&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Pollution can cause physiological stress in this species (Jung <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is concern that warming waters caused by climate change will negatively impact the recruitment success of this species (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2016, Lee<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).","This species is easily confused with its co-occurring sister species,&#160;<em>Pseudopleuronectes schrenki&#160;</em>(Vinnikov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Both species are important commercial resources in the Japanese archipelago, though <em>P. yokohamae</em> occurs more southerly than does&#160;<em>P. schrenki</em>&#160;(Tsukagoshi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;In Japan and likely elsewhere, the population of this species is composed of multiple separate stocks among which there is very limited mixing due to the species' relatively low dispersal ability (Minegishi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). According to genetics research, there appears to be some separation between stocks off China and those off Korea (Zhang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;The largest abundance in Japanese waters and globally is distributed on the northern Pacific coast of Japan (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong> This species is common in Russian waters (Parin <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over 42 years, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species declined from the mid-1990s to about 2011 but has been increasing since (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020). In Peter the Great Bay, abundance was high in the 1980s and 1990s, sharply declined for 10 to 15 years, and then increased until 2007. These fluctuations are due to recruitment success, which in turn, is dictated by water temperatures in juvenile habitats. These changes in environmental conditions coincide with a 20-30 year cycle in stock status (Vdovin <em>et al</em>. 2013). The density of this species in scientific trawl surveys conducted on the shelf of Peter the Great Bay was 0.674 t/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1996-2005, 0.128 t/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2006-2010, and 0.502 t/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2011-2018, which represents a decline of about 25% over this time period (Shuntov and Volvenko 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Japan:</strong>&#160;This species is commercially valued throughout its range in Japan. In the Seto Inland Sea area, this species is targeted by fisheries off the prefectures of Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, and Oita. Overall, the stock is currently considered to be at a critically low level. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, CPUE was high from 1993 to 1997 but by 2003, CPUE had declined by 80-90%. Since then (over the past three generations), CPUE continued to decline (by about 50%), and has remained at a very low level, with the exception of some increase in 2006 and 2007. CPUE trends in Fukuoka and Oita prefectures are similar to that of Yamaguchi Prefecture (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). In addition to the steep declines in stock and spawning stock biomass from 1993 to 2003, age and size at maturity also declined. These documented declines are likely caused, at least in part, by the high capture rate of juveniles, which leads to recruitment overfishing. Fishing effort in the small trawl and gillnet fisheries declined in the early 2000s (Imoto <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tanda 2008, Tanda <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>In Tokyo Bay, the abundance of this species was high in the 1980s but declined by about 83% from the late 1980s to mid-2000s. Fisheries catches also declined significantly (e.g. Kume <em>et al</em>. 2006, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2009b). These changes are in part due to reduced recruitment success influenced by warmer water temperatures in shallow nursery habitats (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2019).&#160;The stock of this species in the Ise Bay and Mikawa Bay area has also declined (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;<br/><br/>In western Aomori Prefecture, catches of this species declined significantly in the 1980s and 1990s and this was caused by high fishing pressure (Kooka<em> et al</em>. 2000). Stocks of this species off southern Hokkaido, which is near the northern extent of its range, fluctuate dependent on recruitment success, which is influenced by annual changes in environmental conditions (Higashitani <em>et al.</em> 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>On the northern Pacific coast of Japan in the Tohoku region, this species is taken in fisheries off the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima and Ibaraki with the largest catches taken from Miyagi in the Sendai Bay area (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). Overall, the stock status of this species in the Tohoku region is considered to be at a medium level, but exhibiting a declining trend. In Sendai Bay, Miyagi Prefecture, abundance declined from the late 1990s to 2005, significantly increased to a time series peak in 2015, and has had a declining trend since then. Over the past three generations (since 2003), abundance increased overall, but has declined by about 35% over nearly one past generation. In both Fukushima and Iwate prefectures, catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased overall in the past three generations (since 2003). In Ibaraki Prefecture, CPUE increased in the late 1990s, declined somewhat in the early 2000s, increased to a time series peak in 2006, and has had a declining trend since then. Over the past three generations (since 2003), CPUE fluctuated widely but was at a similar level in 2019 compared to that of 2003. CPUE has declined by about 80% over the past two and a half generations (since 2006) and the stock is considered to be at a low level with recent poor recruitment. The impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 disrupted the commercial fisheries in this region, and in the absence of fishing pressure, the abundance of demersal fish resources (including this species) increased. Fishing effort has declined over time (Takahashi <em>et al</em>. 2018, Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Korea:</strong>&#160;This species is common in shallow, sandy habitats of southern Korea (Kim<em> et al.</em> 2018). It is commercially valued throughout Korean waters (Park <em>et al.</em> 2018). It represents over 80% of flounder catches in western Korean waters (Hwang <em>et al</em>. 2017). Korean flatfish fisheries have been overfished since at least the 1980s (Yoon <em>et al.</em> 2015). From 2004 to 2007, total flounder catch increased, but then slowly declined by 29% to 2016. There has been a clear decline in flounder abundance on the eastern coast (Jeong <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong>China:</strong> This species is one of the most highly valued commercial marine fishes in Chinese waters (Zheng <em>et al</em>. 2017). Declines in this species have occurred in China as fishing effort increased significantly over time. In Chinese coastal waters, overfishing of the flatfish stocks has occurred at least since the 1980s (Dagang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992<span style="""">,&#160;Tian&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005).&#160;This species is a significant component of the flatfish catches in the Bohai Sea. Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995).&#160;Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e.&#160;<em style="""">Pleuronichthys&#160;</em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu&#160;<em style="""">et al</em>. 2012). Overfishing in the East China Sea, which is primarily driven by Chinese fishing fleets, has caused steep declines in flatfish stocks since the late 1990s (Aonuma&#160;<em style="""">et al</em>. 2019).</span>",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western North Pacific Ocean along continental Asia from the northern East China Sea to the Yellow and Bohai seas, and off the entire Korean Peninsula to Peter the Great Bay and southern Primorye&#160;in&#160;the western Sea of Japan. In the eastern Sea of Japan, it occurs from from Kyushu to Hokkaido. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, it occurs from Tosa Bay and the Seto Inland Sea to Hokkaido (Sakamoto 1984, Li and Wang 1995, Nakabo 2013, Parin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).

In Japan, it is taken by commercial bottom trawl and gill net fisheries (Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Tomiyama <em>et al.</em> 2021) as well as by recreational fishers in the Tohoku region (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). It is also exploited by coastal gillnet and longline fisheries in Korea (Park&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). There is an aquaculture industry for this species in China (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Zheng&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). It is exploited by demersal fisheries in Peter the Great Bay, Russia (Vdovin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,"A variety of management measures are in place to maintain or improve the status of this species in many areas. A resource recovery plan was implemented for this species' stock in Suo-Nada in the Seto Inland Sea in 2004 that included releasing hatchery-raised juveniles into the wild for stock enhancement as well as restrictions on minimum catch size and a closed fishing season (Imoto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The Tokyo Bay stock of this species is managed through measures that include seasonal and semi-weekly bottom trawling closures, minimum size limit, and net mesh size restrictions. Local fishery cooperatives also practice wild stock enhancement by releasing hatchery-reared juveniles into the Bay. It has been recommended that extending the closed fishing period to cover the entire spawning season would help increase the sustainability of the fishery (Sato&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In the Tohoku region, fishing restrictions during the spawning season and on spawning grounds, and catch size limits, are also in place. In the Seto Inland Sea, additional conservation measures may be needed to reduce capture of immature individuals (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). In Sendai Bay, the spawning grounds of this species are protected (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Off Namhae in southern Korea, there is an annual closed season to protect spawning individuals of&#160;this species, and recommendations have been made to extend this closed period to ensure that protective measures occur throughout the entire spawning period (Joo and Gwak 2014).","",,false,false,Global

This is thought to be caused in part by a shift/fluctuation in water temperature. In the Sea of Japan (Aomori to Yamaguchi), overall catch declined by 40-45% over the past three generations (since 2002), and at least four out of the seven prefectures currently report low stock levels.

The generation length, based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods, 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, is estimated to be about 6-7 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species throughout much of its range. For example, in the Sea of Japan, this species is overexploited in waters off the Fukui and Kyoto prefectures (Noguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017).","<strong>Korea: </strong>This species is taken in Korean flounder fisheries, but little information is available on the status of its subpopulation there. Effort data for the Korean flounder fisheries are not consistently collected but effort has likely increased over time. Catches have been trending downwards since the late 1970s, and overfishing is suspected (Chae and Pascoe 2005). This species may be easily confused with&#160;<em>Glyptocephalus stelleri&#160;</em>(Jang<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>China:&#160;</strong>Species-specific population data are limited for this species in Chinese waters, but declines are suspected to be likely, as fishing effort increased significantly over time. In Chinese coastal waters, overfishing of the flatfish stocks has occurred at least since the 1980s (Dagang<em> et al</em>. 1992, Tian <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e., <em>Pleuronichthys </em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Overfishing in the East China Sea, which is primarily driven by Chinese fishing fleets, has caused steep declines in flatfish stocks since the late 1990s (Aonuma <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Sea of Japan:</strong>&#160;This species is caught mainly in the north in demersal fisheries in Japanese waters of the Sea of Japan. Overall catches peaked in 1976, declined to the mid-1980s, increased from the early 1990s to the early 2000s, was mostly stable to 2014, and has declined since 2015. Over the past three generations (since 2002), catches have declined by 40-45%, and at least four out of the seven prefectures (Aomori, Fukui, Kyoto, and Yamaguchi) currently report low stock levels. In Aomori Prefecture (Sea of Japan), catches and stock levels declined by 80-90% over the past three generations (since 2002) and recruitment has been very low since 2010. In Akita Prefecture, catch per unit effort has increased overall in the past three generations (since 2002) and has been stable since 2014. In Yamagata Prefecture, catches over the past three generations (since 2002) have fluctuated over time, with a declining trend since 2015. In Niigata Prefecture, catches over the past three generations (since 2002) increased from 2002 to 2014, but have had a declining trend since then, and recruitment was poor in 2017 and 2018. In Fukui Prefecture, catches over the past three generations (since 2002) peaked in 2003 and have declined by about 87% since then and the stock level is considered to be low. In Kyoto Prefecture, catches over the past three generations (since 2002) peaked in 2003 and have declined by about 98% since then and the stock level is considered to be low. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, catches over the past three generations (since 2002) fluctuated over time, but have declined by about 33% since 2013 and the stock level is considered to be low (Sea of Japan Fisheries Research Institute 2019). In Kyoto and Fukui, the exploitation rate also declined with declining stock size (Noguchi <em>et al. </em>2017). Immature individuals are frequently taken in the catches, and this is likely driving stock declines (Yamasaki <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fujiwara<em> et al. </em>2009, Sea of Japan Fisheries Research Institute 2019). In the Tsushima Strait in southwestern Sea of Japan, catches of this species in flatfish fisheries were not significant until 1998. Female spawning stock biomass increased from 1998 to 2007, and then declined by 45% from 2008 to 2013. This stock was considered stable at high levels as of 2014. Recruitment was high from 2001 to 2004, but declined thereafter. These declines are thought to be caused in part by natural water temperature changes/fluctuations in this area, because recruitment of this species is best in warm-water years (Imai 2014, 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Pacific Japan:</strong>&#160;The Pacific coast stock is larger than the Sea of Japan stock (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021). This species is caught on the Pacific coast of northern Japan in bottom trawl fisheries off Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, and Ibaraki prefectures. Catches in the southern part off Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures has been much greater than in the northern part (Aomori to Miyagi prefectures).&#160;In Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures, catches and recruitment of this species have fluctuated widely since 1969. Fluctuations in annual catches are thought to be caused in part by changes in environmental conditions. Immature individuals are frequently taken in the fishery (Narimatsu <em>et al</em>. 2007, Takahashi <em>et al. </em>2012). The stock in the Tohoku region declined from 1998 to 2001, remained mostly stable to 2012, and has had an increasing trend since then. The highest stock level in the time series (beginning in 1998) occurred in 2017, it has increased overall compared to three generations ago (since about 2000) and recruitment has been above average in recent years.

The Fisheries Agency of Japan has established seasonal marine protected areas (for a few months each year) to maintain and protect the stock resources of this species off Fukushima and Ibaraki prefectures since 2003. There are allowable biological catch (ABC) recommendations in place for the Tohoku region stock&#160;and it is recommended that fishing pressure not be increased so that the current high stock level can be sustained (Narimatsu <em>et al</em>. 2019). To prevent overexploitation in the Sea of Japan, it is recommended to reduce the capture of immature individuals by improving regulations for net mesh size (Noguchi <em>et al.</em> 2017, Sea of Japan Fisheries Research Institute 2019).

It can form spawning aggregations making it very vulnerable and juveniles are harvested in some regions amplifying the impacts of overfishing. In the US South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, the most recent assessments indicate there are declines of over 60% in commercial landings, however, recent assessments conclude the stock is not currently overfished and that overfishing is not occurring. Other countries show moderate to high declines in catch landings. In Cuba, total catch decreased by 40% since the 1980s over three generation lengths (24 to 66 years, based on age estimates of eight to 22 years based on differing entry parameters). Spawning aggregation sizes have declined in Cuba and few major sites are in marine protected areas. It is heavily exploited in many areas and considered overfished in regions of Brazil and Colombia. Regional reductions in landings are wide and substantial yet extended landings databases are not widely available. It is consistent with the information that is available to estimate that the species has undergone at least 20% declines in biomass over 30 to 60 years and it is listed as Near Threatened. Based on past reductions and ongoing fishing levels, further declines could be expected; this could make this species Vulnerable in the future. It is recommended that precautionary management measures be taken including appropriate fisheries data collection to better understand the population structures and the targeted protection of regionally important spawning aggregations.","This species occurs over reef, seagrass and rubble bottoms. It occurs in continental shelf areas as well as in clear waters around islands (Cervigón <em>et al.</em> 1992). Early life stages can be found among a variety of structural habitat types including settlement stages in seagrasses. Large adults are usually found among rocks and coral while juveniles occur over sandy, vegetated (usually <em>Thalassia</em>) habitats (Starck 1971, Cervigón 1993). This species can form small diurnal aggregations that disband during the night (Allen 1985). The juvenile usage of several backreef habitats in comparison to congeners is reviewed in Nagelkerken (2009).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Lutjanus analis</em> is a carnivorous trophic generalist and uses a great variety of prey. Juvenile stages feed on mainly crustaceans, whereas those 6 cm or larger consume post-larval and juvenile fish (Sierra and Popova 1997). Adults feed during the day as well as at night. The main prey are bony fishes, crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms (Allen 1985). Mutton Snappers aggregated at the La Parguera, Puerto Rico, shelf edge during night time the week following the full moon of April and May of 2003 at an average depth of 20-40 m over rocky coralline bottoms and sandy bottoms with abundant gorgonians (Esteves 2005).<br/><br/>Individuals have been observed in spawning condition in the US Caribbean from February through July (Erdman 1976), and have been reported in spawning condition by anglers from April through September in east central Florida (Tishler Meadows 2012). Spawning aggregations are documented from Belize (Heyman and Kjerve 2008) with a sharp reduction in landings and fishing effort in the late 1980s (Grandados-Dieseldorff <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In Cuba, spawning aggregations occur on several shelf regions between May and August in depths of 20-40 m (Claro and Lindeman 2003). A well-known spawning aggregation site at Riley’s Hump has received management attention (see Conservation section). Multiple potential aggregation sites have been identified in Bahia, Brazil (França and Olavo 2015).<br/><br/>Acoustic tracking of one individual of <em>L. analis</em> near no-take marine reserves in the Dry Tortugas, Florida, estimated a home range of about 7.5 km<sup>2</sup> (Farmer and Ault 2011). While this suggests that subpopulations separated by 100 km or less may be able to respond independently to disturbances, there may be limited exchange between the subpopulation in the Gulf of Mexico and the wider Caribbean Sea. Ocean circulation modelling suggests a low probability of snapper larval connectivity between western Caribbean (particularly from the south coast of Cuba) to US waters (Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>Size at 50% maturity was estimated at 33 cm FL and 41 cm FL for males and females, respectively, off Puerto Rico (Figuerola and Torres Ruiz 2001) and at 50 cm FL in Cuba (Claro 1981). For the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Mutton Snapper stock assessment (O’Hop <em>et al.</em> 2015), the following life history values were used: longevity - 40 years; age at 50% maturity - 3.7 years. Additionally, in the US Gulf of Mexico, longevity was observed at 14.5 years, with age at sexual maturity 3.1 years (SERO 2010). For the US Caribbean stock of Mutton Snapper, age of sexual maturity was estimated at three years (SEDAR 2007). Using these different estimates, generation length for this species was estimated to be eight to 22 years. Maximum size is approximately 94 cm and is common to 50 cm (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998, Anderson 2002).","This valuable species is caught with hook and line, seines, gill nets, bottom longlines, traps and spears by divers (Allen 1985). Spawning aggregations are targeted by fishers throughout its range. This species is prized by recreational anglers along Florida's east coast where the majority of landings occur from Cape Canaveral, Florida, through the Florida Keys. The species is popular with spearfishermen in many areas. This species is also subject of a commercial fishery mainly harvested with hook-and-line or spearfishing gear (Burton 2002). Mutton Snapper form spawning aggregations with a high degree of site fidelity (Domeier and Colin 1997) and as such are vulnerable to capture and overexploitation. Juveniles of this species are taken by shrimp trawl bycatch and the shallow vegetation used for settlement and juvenile grow-out can be impacted by coastal construction activities.","The species is prized in warmer Florida state waters and recreational fishing accounted for more fishing mortality in Florida than commercial or headboat fisheries (O’Hop <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Commercial landings in the US South Atlantic range from a minimum of 7.6 mt in 2007 to a peak of 131.4 mt in 1973, and reflect a 76% decline over a three generation length estimate of 24 years, from 68.7 mt in 1990 to 16.3 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). For the southeast coast of Florida, coincident with a 50% decline in effort, combined landings of 11 reef fish species from the headboat fishery in southeast Florida declined by 85% between 1990-2006 (Ault and Franklin 2011). While landings of <em>L. analis </em>declined by 92%, from about 25 mt in 1990 to 2 mt in 2006, it is unclear if the decline in landings is due solely to the decline in effort (Ault and Franklin 2011). Biomass declined to a low in 1994 and then increased to 9570 mt in 2006 (Table 5, Figure 3, SEDAR 2008). Estimated recreational landings from the Atlantic coast of the US peaked in 2008 at 772,798 individuals with 2014 landings at 280,281 individuals (NMFS 2015b). In 2013, the SEDAR Update Assessment of <em>L. analis</em> in both the US South Atlantic and GOM concluded that maximum fishing mortality threshold was 0.18 per year (defined as fishing mortality rate associated with a spawning potential ratio of 30%) and using prior SAFMC and GMFMC protocols, Mutton Snapper was not considered overfished or to be undergoing overfishing (O’Hop <em>et al</em>. 2015). Older assessments from the 1990s indicated that the spawning stock ratio was above the criterion for overfishing established by the SAFMC (Huntsman <em>et al</em>. 1992, 54% in Ault<em> et al</em>. 1998). For US federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, commercial landings of <em>L. analis</em> increased steadily from 1950 through the mid-1980s, to a peak of 164.5 mt in 1987, with a decline to 66.3 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a), representing a decline of 60% over 27 years. Estimated recreational landings from the GOM peaked in 1984 with 319,964 individuals, in 2014 256,391 individuals were reported (NMFS 2015b).This species is caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries that target <em>L. campechanus</em> (Red Snapper) in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico. It is sold in the domestic markets of mainly Mexico City and Guadalajara (SAGARPA 2012). Juveniles are extensively caught in the shrimp fishery, but no official statistics are available at this time. Landings of mixed snapper species in Mexico have fluctuated but appear relatively stable from 1970s to 1996, with little data after these years (INP 2000).<br/><br/><em>Lutjanus analis </em>is historically one of the most targeted species by commercial and recreational fisheries off Cuba. Catch was relatively stable until the early 1990s when a major decline began due to reduced commercial effort, intense subsistence fishing, and historical overexploitation of spawning aggregations (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Total landings decreased from 1,326 mt in 1987 to 645 mt in 2010, a 51% decline over 24 years. Traditionally, about 50% of the landings were from Archipelago Sabana-Camaguey, north-central Cuba. Ranging from small to major declines, evidence suggests that spawning aggregations have decreased in size (Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Landings in northeastern Cuba were relatively stable from 1970s to 1995, but by 2010 catches declined over 50% from more than 400 mt to 145 mt, with stable or increasing effort. Recreational and subsistence fishing also increased during this period.&#160;The Puerto Rican and the US Virgin Islands population managed by the Caribbean Fishery Management Council considers Mutton Snapper current stock exploitation status as not undergoing overfishing, and stock biomass status was not overfished. The majority of landings are from the trap and/or pots, and hook and line fishery. Through the 23 year time series from 1983 to 2005, commercial catches declined 50% (SEDAR 2007, Table 2). Removals from hook and line gear accounted for some 46% of the removals across all years, while pots or traps accounted for about 28.5% (SEDAR 2007). In Colombia, this species can be second only to <em>L. synagris</em> in importance to the lutjanid fishery (Acero and Garzon 1985). The species is fished with many gears in Venezuela (Cervigon 2003).<br/><br/>In east Brazil, a stock assessment conducted by Klippel <em>et al</em>. (2005) estimated that the stock was moderately overexploited. For the northeastern coast, the stock is considered to be overexploited at 20% above the recommended level (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2009). In northeast Brazil, <em>L. analis</em> is one of the most common snappers, both in abundance and catch, and has been deemed as being overexploited with low resiliency (Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species was considered exploited by artisanal hand-line fleets in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil (Gomes de Mattos and Maynou 2009). In the Abrolhos Reef system, the species was reported but ranked below &lt;0.1 in percentage of total biomass (Francini-Filho 2008). In Rio de Janeiro, <em>L. analis </em>are harvested as juveniles, detrimental to stock structure for slow-growing species (Begossi <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Decreasing,"This western Atlantic species is distributed from&#160;Cape Hatteras,&#160;North Carolina south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys north to Tampa, off the Mississippi Delta region, and from Texas (Corpus Christi) south along Mexico to Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Santa Catarina, Brazil (Cervigón 1993, B. Anderson pers. comm. 2011). Its depth range is one to 95 m (Thompson and Munro 1974,&#160;Allen 1985).","This is an important commercial, recreational and artisanal species. Often marketed as Red Snapper (<em>Lutjanus campechanus</em>), the Mutton Snapper is a high-priced species and whole fish sell for 6-8 US$ per pound in St. Croix and Puerto Rico, and Mutton Snapper fillets may sell for as much as US $12 per pound in Miami seafood markets (SEDAR 2007). In Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil, Cunha <em>et al</em>. (2012) found Mutton Snapper to be the tenth most abundant reef fish taxon to be exported on fishery markets. Cheek and throat tissue from larger Mutton Snapper can be considered gourmet items.",Marine,"This species was ranked as Vulnerable in a 1996 IUCN Red List (Huntsman 1996). Additional information has become available since and the IUCN criteria for Red List rankings have evolved with a greater emphasis on data that can specifically demonstrate population or biomass declines over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council established that both commercial and recreational fisheries for Mutton Snapper require a limited access permit, a 16"" TL size limit, and a restriction of 10 fish per person per day or per trip (whichever is more restrictive) during the months of May and June. In addition, some gear restrictions apply and there are annual catch limits on both sectors. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf FMC) also establishes regulations for the recreational Mutton Snapper fishery of 16"" TL size limit; fishing is permitted year-round, but a maximum of 10 fish are permitted per person per day within the snapper aggregate.&#160;In 1992, the Gulf of Mexico Management Council imposed a two month spawning season closure (May and June). Such an intensive fishery likely removes an excessive number of fish that would likely be reproductively active for longer than was previously thought (up to 29 years; Burton 2002). The establishment of the Tortugas Ecological Reserve was in part focused on protecting the Mutton Snapper spawning aggregation at Rileys Hump in the Lower Florida Keys using fisher outreach (Lindeman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Cowie-Haskell and Delaney 2003) and enforcement support including an advanced, high speed vessel (M/V Peter Gladding). Field research subsequent to the closure of Riley’s Hump suggests some population recovery may be occurring (Burton<em> et al.</em>&#160;2005, A. Acosta pers. comm. 2014). In Cuba, the use of set nets has been banned since 2008 and long bottom trawls since 2012 over the entire shelf. In commercial and recreational fisheries, the minimum catch size is 25 cm FL, which allows a substantial catch of juveniles (Claro <em>et al.</em> 2009). Heyman and Kjerfve (2008) documented a consistent Mutton Snapper aggregation at an important multi-species aggregation area in Gladden Spit, Belize. There was a sharp reduction in landings and fishing effort in the late 1980s at this site during rapid growth in the tourism industry and during a shift in fisher livelihoods (Grandados-Dieseldorff <em>et al</em>. 2013). Annual CPUE, individual sizes and sex ratios have been relatively stable from 1999-2011, indicating persistence of the fishery and an absence of overfishing, at least at this site, which corresponds with consistent engagement with the fisher community. In Puerto Rico, there is a mandatory commercial license and permit requirement, and a temporal closure during the spawning season in state waters April-May and US federal waters from April-June. In the US Virgin Islands, there is a closed season from April-June in US federal waters (Russell <em>et al</em>. 2012).","",,false,false,Global

It is moderately long-lived, attains a large size, and aggregates to spawn. It is commonly caught in recreational and commercial fisheries throughout its South African range. It has been recorded in semi-industrial linefish catches in Mozambique and likely features in small-scale fisheries there; it is actively targeted in South Africa, which is the only region for which population data exist. In South Africa the spawning biomass per recruit was reduced to ca. 5% of the pristine level in the 1990s, recovering slightly to around 10% by 2016. Catches of this species declined in the linefishery and the inshore trawl fishery (as a bycatch), and nominal CPUE in the commercial linefishery had dropped to 1.5-4.3% of historical values (1900s) by 1985-1998. The declines meet the criteria for placement into a threatened category; however, modelling of standardized CPUE data show no decline from the late 1980s until 2015. The substantial population reduction occurred prior to the three-generation (21 years) time period, and has remained at a very low level, with some signs of recovery. Since the population would likely decline if South African management regulations are removed, and given the heavy fishing pressure in Mozambique and its unknown status there, this species is listed as conservation dependent under the Near Threatened category. Rebuilding of the stock and monitoring of landings are priorities.","Off the eastern coast of South Africa, this species undergoes well-defined migratory patterns. The migratory life history begins when adults migrate inshore from the Cape to KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast, where they spawn in the spring. They migrate back offshore dispersing over the Agulhas Bank during summer. Eggs and larvae are transported in a southwesterly direction by the inshore peripheral waters of the Agulhas Current. Juveniles spend one to two years in the southeast Cape nursery area before joining the sub-adult population in the southwest Cape. As sub-adults they remain in the southwest Cape for a further three to four years, moving inshore in summer and offshore in winter, until sexually mature. Some of the larger sub-adults (adolescents) undergo a partial adult migration (Griffiths and Hecht 1995).&#160;<br/><br/>These are a schooling fish, at depths from 20-200 m (Griffiths and Hecht 1995; Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data), found over coastal, continental shelf, and soft bottom habitats, although spawning adults are consistently found on wrecks and reefs off KwaZulu-Natal&#160; in winter.&#160;<br/><br/>This species attains 50% sexual maturity at 90 cm fork length and at age 5 years (100% at 6 years) (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). It lives to at least nine years of age (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). This relatively late age and size at sexual maturity compared with other sciaenid species is not attributed to fishing pressure, although this species has been targeted in South Africa for more than a century, rather, it is suggested that it is an adaptation to a migratory life style (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). Generation length is therefore conservatively estimated at five to six years, and Winker<em> et al.</em> (2013, 2014) suggested seven years. This species can attain 130 cm total length (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Diets consists predominantly of particularly pilchard (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>)., as well as anchovy (<em>Engraulis japonicus</em>), and horse mackerel (<em>Trachurus capensis</em>).","The major threat to this species is overfishing and the South African stock is significantly depleted (Hutton <em>et al.</em> 2001). This species is particularly vulnerable to recruitment overfishing, because it is so commonly harvested prior to maturity (Hutton <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>It is targeted throughout its distribution range by commercial and recreational linefishers. Preliminary per recruit analyses indicated that the Geelbek stock was already over-exploited in 1985. Large quantities are caught by lineboats operating on the Agulhas Banks during the summer months. In KwaZulu-Natal, only adults are caught, primarily during their winter/spring spawning aggregation where they occur on well-known reefs; catches are mainly made at night&#160;and landings are not monitored there. There is heavy fishing pressure in Mozambique but there is little information on catches of this species in this region.","There are only population data for the South African component, which is significantly depleted and considered to be collapsed (Hutton<em> et al</em>. 2001,Winker <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kerwath and Winker 2013). Catches of this species have declined in the linefish and inshore trawl fisheries, and CPUE from 1985-1998 had dropped to 1.5-4.3% of historical values (early 1900s) (Griffiths 2000); catch per boat/year in the 1980s had declined to approximately 3% of the catches (of equivalent unit) in the 1990s (Hutton <em>et al</em>. 2001); the spawning biomass per recruit level (SBPR) was reduced by approximately 95% from pristine levels (Hutton<em> et al.</em> 2001). Total commercial catch along the South African coastline for the period 1985-1997 was 500 t per annum; landings declined from 397 t in 2001 to 248 t in 2016. Connell (2012) showed a possible decline in egg production since 2008 along the KwaZulu-Natal coast where spawning occurs. A modelling approach using standardized CPUE data based on Department of Fisheries commercial linefish records submitted by fishers was used to evaluate estimated and predicted trends in population size and this showed no overall decline since the late 1980s (see Supplementary data). There were area-based differences, with low catch rates persisting off the southern Cape, but with increases off the south-east coast (Donovan 2011, Winker<em> et al.</em> 2015); the low CPUE off the southern Cape could indicate that the increased CPUE levels on the south-east coast (Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal) may not persist. Boyd (2017) showed that overall SBPR had recovered slightly to around 10-11% of pristine levels, a possible consequence of management intervention to reduce fishing effort in 2003.<br/><br/>There are no population data for this species in Mozambique waters which has a coastline of around 3,000 km (i.e. &gt; half the distributional range of this species), and virtually no readily-available records of its occurrence there, other than for the northern Mozambique specimens mentioned in Song <em>et al</em>. (2017), and a specimen reportedly observed in catch by a semi-industrial linefishing vessel in Mozambique (catch locality not known; Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data).

It reaches a maximum size of 71 cm total length (TL), males mature at 38 cm TL and females at 40 cm TL (Lam 2009, Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous, with litter sizes of 1–23, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 12–15 cm TL (Lam 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Yu 2018). Female age-at-maturity is inferred as 1–2 years (based on similar size Spadenose Shark (<em>Scoliodon laticaudus</em>)) and maximum age is 6 years resulting in a generation length of 3.75 years (Nair 1976, Devadoss 1988, Kasim 1991, Yu 2018). </p>","<p>The New Spadenose Shark is subject to intense fishing pressure across most of its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries mainly by trawl and gillnet and is retained for the meat for human consumption (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). </p>    <p>In China, it is mostly captured in southern waters, particularly in Taiwan Strait and Tokin Bay (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (McKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990<a name=""_Hlk20734780""> </a>to 2010 (Fabinya and Liu 2014).</p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk22883817"">By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). </a>The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively (Fisheries Agency 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).</p><p>  </p><p>In Viet Nam, this species is taken in trawl and bottom longline fisheries that operate at depths of 20–50 m (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the New Spadenose Shark. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014, FAO 2020a). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p><p>In Malaysia, this species is regularly landed; it is captured as trawl bycatch in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and in gillnets during the monsoon season in Sarawak (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Across Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al. </em>2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>In Indonesia, the New Spadenose Shark is captured in gillnets and less commonly in mini-trawls (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>      <a name=""_Hlk20731819"">Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation. In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2008, Heileman 2008). In Taiwan, there has been an estimated 10-20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012)</a>. In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).","<p>The New Spadenose Shark is very abundant in some coastal waters (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Taiwan, it is abundant on the west coast based on observation at landing sites (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), although the population trend over time is unknown. In China, the population is considered to be fairly stable with a possible slow decline over the past 20 years (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). In Borneo, it is reported as common (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Malaysia, this species is abundant and it is anecdotally reported to have a stable catch trend for at least the past 10 years (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, the New Spadenose Shark is abundant with anecdotally stable catches since at least 2003 (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is exposed to intense fishing pressure across its range, yet information from across most of its range reports the New Spadenose Shark as abundant and common with a mostly stable population over the past 10–17 years, that is, at least over the past three generation lengths (11 years). There is no evidence to suspect this species has declined, yet the intense and ongoing fishing pressure on this species is a cause for concern, and there has been a possible slow decline in China. It is suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold.  </p>",Decreasing,"The New Spadenose Shark is endemic to Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. It is found from Japan to western Indonesia, including North and South Korea, China, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Gulf of Thailand, Singapore, Borneo and the Philippines (White <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","This species is used for human consumption. The meat is of moderate value in Taiwan and China, and limited value in Indonesia (White<em> et al. </em>2006, H. Ho and X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the liver oil is used (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, there are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).    </p><p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan  coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take  areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial  seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a). Further research is needed on population size and trend, life history, and catch levels should be monitored.</p>","",,false,false,Global

This is a very rare and poorly-known species with some uncertainty regarding its population status. Information on catches in large-scale and small-scale fisheries are generally lacking, although shrimp trawl fisheries and a variety of other artisanal fisheries that are likely to catch it operate across its range and it is a known bycatch in Mexican demersal trawling.

Based on the average rate of decline of spawning stock biomass (SSB) from 1952 to 2018, applied over the past 3 generation lengths, or 29–42 years, this species is estimated to have declined between 17 and 24%. The latest estimate of SSB for this species is estimated to be less than 5% of original biomass. The stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring. Therefore, this species is listed as Near Threatened under Criterion A2.</p>","The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is epipelagic and usually oceanic, but seasonally comes close to the shore. It is found from the surface to depths of at least 550 m and tolerates wide temperature ranges.&#160; It spends the majority of its time in the upper mixed layer, but makes frequent dives to below the thermocline. Pacific Bluefin Tuna school by size, sometimes with in mixed species schools with other scombrids. Some juvenile Pacific Bluefin Tuna undertake trans-Pacific migrations from nursery areas in the western Pacific into the eastern Pacific, spending up to four years before returning to the western Pacific to spawn (Bayliff 1994). It was originally thought that the proportion of Pacific Bluefin Tuna that underwent this migration was relatively small, but recent research using intrinsic tracers in tissues suggests that in some years it likely that a much larger proportion of the population does this (Madigan 2015, Madigan <em>et al</em>. 2017, Collette and Graves 2019). Recent studies in the western and eastern Pacific using electronic archival tags have documented the tracks and timelines of transpacific and regional migrations (Kitagawa <em>et al</em>. 2009, Boustany <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has been theorized that Pacific Bluefin, Atlantic Bluefin and Southern Bluefin move to small, strongly convergent segments of energetically forced eddy structures, which although unproductive, allow spawning schools of sufficient size to generate sufficient numbers of larvae (Bakun 2013). This strategy may circumvent resident predator pits while exerting sufficient predatory loss on resident predators to facilitate this circumvention, and thus is an important consideration in management of spawning areas.<br/><br/>The Pacific Bluefin Tuna&#160; is a voracious predator that feeds on a wide variety of small schooling fishes and squid, and also eats crabs and other less sessile organisms (Collette and Graves 2019). Larvae (2.3–14.6 mm TL) feed during the day on small zooplankton including copepods, cladocerans, and appendicularians (Uotani <em>et al</em>. 1990, Kodama <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the Tsushima Current region (Sea of Japan), small Pacific Bluefin Tuna (20–25 cm FL) preyed upon small squid while larger fish (25-35 cm FL) gradually shifted their diet to mesopelagic fishes (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Kuroshio region of the north western Pacific, small Pacific Bluefin Tuna preyed mostly on small zooplankton (crustacean larvae) and larger individuals shifted to epipelagic clupeoid fishes such as sardines and anchovies. In the eastern Pacific, juvenile Pacific Bluefin Tuna feed primarily on fishes, which constitute 93% of gut contents by volume, but they also eat small quantities of crustaceans and squids (Pinkas 1971, Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>Pacific Bluefin Tuna are known to spawn in only two areas of the western North Pacific: from the Philippine Islands north to the Ryuku Islands from April to June and further north in the Sea of Japan from June to August (Yabe <em>et al</em>. 1966, Ueyanagi 1969, Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2017). The distribution of sizes of fish on the two spawning grounds differs, with larger fish (modal size 220 cm FL) spawning on the southern grounds and smaller fish (modal size 150 cm FL) spawning in Sea of Japan. The difference in size distributions results in a difference in estimated age at 50% maturity: age 11 for the southern grounds, and age 4 for the northern grounds (Huff 2017, Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, Tanaka (2006) estimated that the size at first maturity is 100–150 cm FL (50–60 kg) at an age of approximately 3 to 5 years. The fraction of females in spawning condition increases steadily on the spawning grounds through the spawning season, as females leave the area immediately after spawning ceases (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2018). The sex ratio is about 1:1. Females are batch spawners and can spawn almost every day with an average batch fecundity of 6.4 million oocytes (Okochi <em>et al</em>. 2016). Batch fecundity increases with length, from about five million eggs at 190 cm FL to about 25 million eggs at 240 cm FL (Schaefer 2001, Sawada <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Collette and Graves 2019). Larvae have been shown to react to biological (e.g. food, predation) and physical conditions (e.g. sea temperature, sea flow) during early life history stages (Satoh 2010; Satoh <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013). The life cycle of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna has been completed under aquaculture conditions, the first for a large species of tuna (Sawada <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>While most Pacific Bluefin Tuna caught off California are in the 5–25 kg weight range, fish as large as 457.7 kg and 271.2 cm FL, have been caught off the Channel Islands during the winter months. The largest Pacific Bluefin Tuna recorded by the Far Seas Fisheries Research Laboratory, Shimizu, Japan weighed approximately&#160; 555 kg and was about 3 m long (Foreman and Ishizuka 1990). It was caught about 300 miles south of Kyushu Island, Japan in April 1986 (Collette and Graves 2019). The IGFA all-tackle game fish record is of a 411.6 kg fish caught off Three Kings Islands, northern New Zealand in February 2014 (IGFA 2020). Growth is most rapid in the first few years of life and asymptotic length is reached at an age of approximately 20 years or older (Murua <em>et al</em>. 2017). Longevity is at least 26 years based on a 260 cm FL fish (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2009). As with the other two species of bluefin tunas, males tend to grow larger than females.<br/><br/>Based on maturity and longevity studies (Collette <em>et al</em>. 2011), the generation length was previously estimated to be between 7–9 years (Collette and Graves 2019), based on the age class data including maximum age, natural mortality and maturity estimates of Pacific Bluefin Tuna used in the 2014 ISC stock assessment (ISC 2014). According to the ISC 2014 assessment, a maximum age of 20 years was modelled and used as an accumulator for all older ages. It was estimated that only 0.15% of the unfished cohort remains by the age of 20 years. Moreover, the assessment used an age at 50% maturity of 4 years and an age of 100% maturity of 5 years. Natural mortality was also age-specific, as 1.6 at age 0, 0.38 at age 1, and 0.25 from age 2 to 20 years.<br/><br/>However, generation length is likely at least 9.5 years, based on age of first maturity and longevity parameters used in the SA and VB in the most recent stock assessment (e.g. 20% at 3 years, 50% at 4 years, 100% at 5 years, with a longevity of 26 years). Although even these parameters may be highly underestimated (A. Boustany, pers. comm., July 2020), and Goodyear (1995) reports a generation length range between 12 and 14 years. To accommodate this uncertainty, generation length is currently estimated to be between 9.5 and 14 years, corresponding to a three generation length time period of 29 to 42 years.","Purse seines are the dominant gear type, accounting for about two-thirds of the catch, while coastal set nets, trolling and pelagic longlines account for most of the reminder. Japan is responsible for the majority of the landings in the western Pacific, with some catch by Taiwan and Korea. The United States was responsible for the largest catches in the eastern Pacific through the late 1970s, fishing in waters off Baja California.&#160; However, U.S. effort and landings decreased when Mexico established its exclusive economic zone in 1976. Mexico has accounted for the majority of eastern Pacific landings since the mid-1980s and a significant fraction of the purse seine catch of juvenile fish is transported to coastal pens for fattening (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>The price of the first big bluefin brought into what was formerly the Tokyo Tsukiji market, an annual event intended to generate publicity, has substantially increased each year: $396,000, 341 kg (2011), $735,000, 269 kg (2012), $1,800,000, 222 kg (2013). In 2019, a 278 kg bluefin sold for $3,100,000 (BBC 2019). However, the extent to which the increasing value of this species is an indicator of the increasing fishery pressure on this species is unclear without knowledge of Japanese ex-vessel prices for the Pacific bluefin (J. Graves, pers. comm. August 2020). However, the fishery's end value was estimated to be worth more than $800,000 million in 2018 (Pew 2020).<br/><p></p>","Pacific Bluefin Tuna comprise a single, pan-Pacific population, with no significant genetic differentiation between samples from Japan and Mexico (Nomura <em>et al</em>. 2014) or from Taiwan and New Zealand (Tseng and Smith 2012). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate significant movement of juvenile and adults from the western North Pacific to the eastern North Pacific, with adults returning to the western North Pacific for spawning (Madigan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Most of the catch of this species is from the western Pacific Ocean, with 20–30% occurring in the eastern Pacific (Collette and Graves 2019). FAO worldwide reported landings show a sharp increase from 1,452 mt in 1950 to 40,094 mt in 1956, as the purse seine fishery developed. Landings remained high (25,000–40,000 mt) for the next ten years. Since that time, landings have shown considerable variation, likely resulting from fluctuations in recruitment, with highs approaching the levels of the 1960s to a low of 8,797 mt in 1990.&#160; Landings for the past several years have averaged around 14,000 mt (Collette and Graves 2019). The total Pacific Bluefin Tuna catch by members of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) was 10,177 mt in 2018 and 10,940 in 2019, a 25% decrease from the 2013–2017 average (WCPFC 2019). The ISC is responsible for conducting regular stock assessments for the Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and created the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group (PBFWG) in 1996 with the task to assemble, conduct and analyse fisheries statistics, biological studies and stock assessments for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) are jointly in charge of the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and use the ISC stock assessment determination and advice to establish conservation and management measures.<br/><br/>The base case results from the latest stock assessment (ISC 2020) show that spawning stock biomass (SSB) has fluctuated throughout the assessment period (1952–2018), declined steadily from 1996 to 2010, and increased slowly from 2011 to 2018. The estimated biomass trend for the last 30 years is robust, but SSB prior to the 1980s is uncertain due to data limitations. The 2018 SSB is estimated at 25,228 mt. Historical recruitment estimates have fluctuated since 1952, with no clear trend. The 2016 recruitment estimate (~17 million fish) exceeds the historical average (~13 million fish), but the recent 2018 estimate, which is based on fewer observations and is more uncertain, assessed around 4 million fish, about 35% of the average.<br/><br/>The WCPFC adopted an initial biomass rebuilding target (the median SSB estimated for the period 1952 through 2014, SSB<sub>MED</sub>), and a second biomass rebuilding target (20%SSBF=0 under average recruitment), without giving a specific fishing mortality reference level. SSB<sub>MED</sub> was estimated in the stock assessment to be 6.7%SSB<sub>F</sub>=0 and the corresponding fishing mortality expressed as SPR of F6.7%SPR. SPR is the ratio of the cumulative spawning biomass that an average recruit is expected to produce over its lifetime when the stock is fished at the current intensity to the cumulative biomass that could be produced by an average recruit over its lifetime if the stock was unfished. Due to the projections including catch limits, fishing mortality is expected to decline. In other words, Fx%SPR will increase as biomass increases. The point estimate of the SSB<sub>2016</sub> was 3.3%SSB<sub>F</sub>=0 and the fishing mortality for 2016 corresponds to F6.7%SPR (WCPFC 2019). According to ISSF (2020), Pacific Bluefin Tuna is heavily overfished and is rebuilding slowly. The ISC did not estimate SSB relative to SSB<sub>MSY</sub> or F relative to F<sub>MSY</sub>. However, estimated SSB is 4.5% of the unfished level and at or close to the historical minimum. F is substantially higher than some indicators used as proxies for F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/>Estimated population decline for this species was calculated over two different three generation length timeframes of 29 and 42 years (given that generation length may range between 9.5 and 14 years). As estimated SSB for this species has fluctuated substantially since 1952 (ISC 2020), two methods were used to estimate the change in SSB over the past 29–42 years. In the first method, linear percent change in SSB over the different time periods (1989-2018; 1976-2018) was calculated using 3-year averages for SSB endpoints. Given the extreme non-linear fluctuation in estimated SSB, this yielded a 45% increase in SSB between 1989–2018, and a 6% decrease in SSB between 1976–2018. In a second, preferred method more applicable for non-linear fluctuations, the average annual percent change in SSB across the entire time series (1952–2018) was calculated and then used to estimate the population change over the last 29 to 42 years, assuming an exponential pattern of decline. Based on this preferred method, this species is estimated to have declined by 17 to 24% over the past 29 to 42 years respectively.",Decreasing,"The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is present throughout the Pacific Ocean and enters the eastern Indian Ocean. In the eastern Pacific, it is found from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California and Baja California, Mexico. In the western Pacific, it is known from Sakhalin Island in the southern Sea of Okhotsk south to the northern Philippines. Although basically a temperate species, it also ventures into tropical waters south to French Polynesia and New Zealand, but there is no evidence of spawning in these areas (Collette and Graves 2019). Spawning has only been reported in the western North Pacific Ocean (Bayliff 1994, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Tanaka <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is a high-value species in the global fresh-fish markets, particularly in the sashimi and sushi markets of Japan, and aquaculture production is being intensively studied in Japan.&#160;It is the most expensive fish in the world (Collette and Graves 2019). It is important to note that aquaculture production has now spread to Mexico, where the total production may now exceed wild catch.",Marine,"In the most recent stock assessment, WCPFC was advised to note the current very low level of spawning biomass, the current level of overfishing, and the strong influence on the projections of the inclusion of a relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016. A precautionary approach to the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna was recommended by most CCMs, particularly with regard to the timing of increasing catch levels, until the stock has been rebuilt to higher biomass levels.<br/><br/>It was also noted that the projection based on the base-case model representing the current WCPFC (CMM 2017-09) and IATTC (C-16-08) management measures under the low recruitment scenario gave a 98% probability of achieving the initial biomass rebuilding target by 2024. This estimated probability exceeds the threshold of 75% or above in 2024 set by the WCPFC Harvest Strategy (Harvest Strategy 2017-02). In the latter strategy, recruitment should switch from the low recruitment scenario to the average recruitment scenario the year after the initial rebuilding target is achieved, although there is no evidence to suggest that recruitment will increase at that point. The probability of achieving the second biomass rebuilding target (20%SSBF=0) 10 years after the first target is achieved or by 2034, whichever comes first, is estimated to be 96% under average recruitment but only 3% under low recruitment. Only the 96% level exceeds the threshold set by the strategy.<br/><br/>The WCPFC Harvest Strategy informed by the ISC projections aims to: (1) provide catch reduction options if the projection results indicate the initial rebuilding target will not be met; or (2) provide relevant information for optional increase in catch if the initial rebuilding target is likely to be achieved with greater than 75% probability. Based on the projection results, the probability of achieving the initial rebuilding target exceeded the level prescribed in the strategy and, thus, some optional scenarios with higher catch limits were provided&#160; (WCPFC 2019).<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global
173434501,41737,Carcharhinus macloti,Near Threatened,A2d,2021,2020-11-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>) is a small (to 110 cm total length) shark that occurs from East Africa to southern Japan and the Australian east coast in the Indian Ocean and Northwest and Western Central Pacific. It is demersal on continental and insular shelves at depths of 0–200 m. The species is caught as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line, and is retained for its meat, and to a lesser extent for its fins. The population is suspected to be declining across most of its range. It is subject to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range, except for within Australia, where it is fished sustainably and there is low to moderate managed fishing pressure. The species is still common in parts of its Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia region but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across more than half of the Hardnose Shark’s range are also reported. It is suspected that the Hardnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2d.","The Hardnose Shark is demersal on continental and insular shelves from close inshore to a depth of 200 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigman 2016). It sometimes occurs in large aggregations. It reaches a maximum size of 110 cm total length, males mature at 69–74 cm TL and females mature at 70–89 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 1–3 pups, a suspected biennial reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 40–49 cm TL (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Australia, female age-at-maturity is estimated as 4 years and maximum age as 11.8 years; generation length is therefore 8 years (Smart <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The Hardnose Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, trawl, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and to a lesser extent, for the low value fins.<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, catches of marine resources reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999, suggesting stocks are fully fished. Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are under-reported and most small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or over-exploited, especially where they are found close to population centres (FAO 2006).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the Hardnose Shark's inshore habitats. For example, in Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For example, in Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Indonesia has the highest global catch of sharks (Oakes and Sant 2019). Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2020). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is a component of trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries across its range. On the east coast of Australia, the Hardnose Shark accounts for 4% of the elasmobranch catch within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area in the East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is also captured in small amounts in the Queensland Shark Control Program (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010).","<p></p><p></p>In the Arabian Seas region, there is very little information on population trends of this species. This species is reported as common in the Arabian Sea fisheries of India (K.K. Akhilesh pers. comm. 9 February 2017) and a frequent catch (but not abundant) in Pakistan (M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). In India, trawl data from Mumbai in Maharashtra indicate declines in landings of this species from 206 t in 1999 to 23 t in 2005; an 89% decline in 7 years (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). At the Cochin Fish Harbor, India, in 1981–1982, this species represented between 2.2–2.3% of shark landings, but the species' landings had declined by 2008 to &lt;1% of shark landings (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2011). Within the Gulf, the species was not reported from Qatar but appears in landings in Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, where it accounts for 1–1.5% of shark landings by number (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Surveys of the Iranian Qeshm Island suggest it is one of the most commonly landed species in October (24% of landings by number) (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). It is reported as a dominant species in landings in the Mussandam region of Oman where it accounted for 8% of observed landings by number (Henderson et al. 2004). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches. The intense level of exploitation and declines in other shark species, leads to a suspected population decline of 20–29% for the Hardnose Shark in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (24 years) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, this species is still considered common along the east coast of India and the Andaman Islands, but it is not commonly seen elsewhere such as in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia (K. K. Bineesh, A. Haque, A. Bin Ali, Fahmi, and D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks and rays are very high in Southeast Asia but have declined and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber et al. 2009). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers. comm. 22 May 2007). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Hardnose Shark in Southeast Asia are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In Australia, an ecological risk assessment of this species in the Northern Prawn Fishery found it to be sustainably fished (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It was also found to be sustainably fished in all other fisheries in which it is encountered across its Australian range (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Overall, the population is sustainably fished in Australia but suspected to be declining in more than 50% of the other parts of its range. It is still common in parts of the Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia region but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. This, combined with the declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across more than half of the Hardnose Shark's range, leads to a suspected 20–29% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Hardnose Shark occurs from East Africa to southern Japan and the Australian east coast, that is, it ranges across the Indian Ocean and Northwest and Western Central Pacific (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, DoFM 2014, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Motomura <em>et al</em>. 2017, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2018, Krajangdara 2019).","The species is used for its meat which is often consumed fresh but also dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries. Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,"There are few species-specific conservation measures in place. In Bangladesh, this species is protected under the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012. In Australia, fisheries are well regulated with limited entry, catch or effort limits, gear restrictions, finning regulations, and size limits. Throughout much of the rest of the Hardnose Shark’s range there are few effective regulations that limit the take of this species. Several nations within its range have general regulations that apply to sharks, and the marine protected areas in parts of its range may provide some benefit to the species. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global
173434793,161376,Carcharhinus sorrah,Near Threatened,A2d,2021,2020-10-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Spottail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em>) is a medium-sized (to 196 cm total length) coastal shark that occurs throughout much of the tropical Indo-West Pacific from the surface to at least 140 m depth. This is among the most productive of sharks with fast growth rates, early maturity, and moderate fecundity, suggesting that this species is more resilient to exploitation relative to most other shark species. It is caught as target and bycatch throughout its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is retained for its meat, fins, skin, teeth and liver oil. It is often one of the species most commonly still caught in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries throughout southern and south-east Asia, and Australia. Limited species-specific data is available on the population trend, but carcharhinid sharks throughout much of the region have declined due to the intensive level of fishing pressure. In northern Australia, the species has recovered from historic overfishing and is currently sustainably fished, providing some refuge for the species. While the Spottail Shark's high productivity allows it to sustain higher levels of fishing mortality than many other species, there are reports that its abundance has declined in areas with very intensive fishing. Therefore, the Spottail Shark is suspected to almost meet decline criteria and is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A2d.","The Spottail Shark occurs on mud and sand substrates and coral reefs on continental and insular shelves to a depth of at least 140 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It&#160; reaches a maximum size of 196 cm total length (TL) in the Arabian Seas region, and 160 cm TL elsewhere (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Size-at-maturity varies regionally with males mature at 106–109 cm TL in Arabian Seas and at 90 cm TL in Australia and females mature at 110–118 cm TL in Arabian Seas and 95 cm TL in Australia (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta with litter sizes of 2–4 pups, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of&#160; 44–72 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Age data from Australia indicates that age-at-maturity is 2–3 years and maximum age is 14 years, resulting in a generation length of 8 years (Davenport and Stevens 1988).","There is little information on catches of the Spottail Shark as species-specific data is not usually recorded. Carcharhinids are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries throughout most of its distribution have experienced increased demand for sharks and simultaneously there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in many of these nations (e.g., Spaet and Berumen 2015). In Australia, the Spottail Shark is taken in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018). The levels of catch in these fisheries is currently modest and maintained at sustainable levels.<br/><br/>The Spottail Shark is reported to constitute 0.7% of the catch of sharks and rays at Muncar in eastern Java, Indonesia (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Fahmi and Sumadhiharga 2007, Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nawawi et al. 2020, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020, ).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Spottail Sharks are taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries using multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net, longline, gillnet, and set net. All bycatch in Malaysia is retained for the meat for human consumption, for bait in traps or for fish meal production for aquaculture. Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak has more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly et al. 2020). There has been, and is still, currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated to the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reporting to FAO for sharks and rays comprises ~3% of global catch at 23,808 t per year through 2000–2010. Purse seine and gillnets contribute to the majority of the landings. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. <br/><br/>Spottail Sharks is subject to intense fishing pressure on its coastal habitats in Viet Nam being taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, and longline, and it is retained for human consumption or for fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is some targeting of sharks using longlines, hook and line, and ‘shark lines’. Target shark fisheries developed in the 1980s in response to demand for shark fin and other products including shark skin, cartilage, and liver oil and reached a peak at the end of the 1980s followed by a decline in catches (Lack and Sant 2012, V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam’s EEZ in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The fleet tends to operate in offshore fisheries (&gt;5 nm from shore) and mostly use trawls, but also purse seine, longlines, and traps (FAO 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly et al. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated&#160; the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>In Kuwait, in 2008, the Spottail Shark made up 12% of elasmobranch landings by number while in Qatar it represented 4% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2012). In Bahrain, it represented 7% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore and Peirce 2013). In a survey of landing sites along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts, this species was reported from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt and accounted for 7% of shark landings by number (Bonfil 2003). In Yemen, it was one of the dominant species landed around Socotra Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (up to 12% of shark landings by number) (Shaher 2007). In Sudan, it made up 19% of the shark landings by number in 2002 and 11% in 2013–2014 (I. Elhassan unpubl. data 2017). It is also commonly caught by illegal Yemeni fishers operating in Sudanese waters (16% of landings by number during three days of fishing). In the Saudi Red Sea, it makes up 33% of elasmobranch landings by number, with many of those landed being juveniles targeted in nursery areas (Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species is not very common in the Maldives, although it was caught on handlines prior to the ban on shark fisheries (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). In Sri Lanka, it is also one of the dominant species in landings (IOTC 2014).<br/><br/>In the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner <em>et al</em>. 2011). The high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye <em>et al</em>. 2007). While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting shark populations (Glaser <em>et al</em>. 2015). In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating.","There are few species-specific data on the population trend of the Spottail Shark. In Australia, three separate stocks are recognized (east coast, north/west coast, and Gulf of Carpentaria) (<span style="""">Ovenden <em>et al.</em> 2007)</span>. All stocks are currently assessed as sustainable as part of a multispecies assessment of ""blacktip"" sharks (Graceful Shark (<em>Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides</em>), Blacktip Shark (<em>C.limbatus</em>), Spottail Shark, and Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C.tilstoni</em>)) <span style="""">(Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2018</span>). Assessments of&#160; population status using tag-recapture data indicate that current catch levels are sufficient to maintain stocks at sustainable levels in the north/west and east stocks (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2013, Harry <em>et al.</em> 2016). Catches by foreign vessels in the 1970s and 1980s across northern Australia are believed to have caused significant population depletion, but regulation changes that resulted in only a small domestic fleet targeting sharks since the mid-1980s has allowed the stocks to recover and they are believed to be close to pre-fishing levels.&#160;<br/><br/>Throughout most of its Asian range, the Spottail Shark continues to be one of the most commonly landed coastal sharks, including in Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. Given the ongoing and intensive coastal fishing pressure through much of this range, it is one of the most productive species in the region. In Indonesia, this species is commonly caught, especially along the Indian Ocean coast (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009).<strong>&#160;</strong> Reconstructed catch data for the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shows carcharhinids increased throughout the mid to late 1900s. Although landings or catch data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can  be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased  while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before it rapidly decreased ~325% in the mid 1990s to 11,500 t; catch has remained relatively stable since (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s before reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000 and 17,500 t until 2004. After which, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600 and 14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian EEZ of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort, which is equivalent to a 30% decline over three generation lengths (24 years) of the Spottail Shark.<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, catches of carcharhinids in the east has increased at a relatively stable rate beginning in the 1950s to 2014 with catch of ~4,500 t. In the west, carcharhinid catch sharply increased in the early 1960s from under 1,000 t per year to ~6,500 t by the late 1970s. Catch has since decreased sharply and has been under 2,000 t per year since 2010, equivalent to a 52% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Borneo, carcharhinid landings increased in Sarawak throughout the 1950s and sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t. They then decreased to 4–5,000 t throughout the 1980s before increasing to 7,400 t again in 1997 and then decreasing to 2,500 t in 2014, equivalent to a 79% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Sabah, landings of carcharhinids slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1980s before steeply increasing to 14,800 t in 1995 and then decreasing to 9,400 t in 2014, equivalent to a 44% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Borneo. These levels of decline are not species-specific but informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks and rays from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam EEZ, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The reconstructed catch data showed an 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). When this decline is scaled to three generation lengths (24 years) it represents a decline <span style="""">of 95%, </span>in Viet Nam.<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">There is limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s, a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">–1980 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al. </em>2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Surveys of local markets from 2006<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">–2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>The Spottail Shark dominates landings in many countries across the Arabian Seas region. It is the most commonly landed species in the United Arab Emirates making up 32% of shark landings by number&#160;and 24% of sharks by number traded from Oman (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015a, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Jabado&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015b). It is the second most commonly landed species in Iran, but time series from trawl surveys indicate a declining trend over 10 years (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017).&#160;The species dominates landings in Pakistan, where there has been a decline in landings since 1990, and in Oman (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). This species was commonly caught on the coast of India, but has declined considerably in the last decade (A.K. Akhilesh&#160; pers. comm. <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">9 February 2017). In a pelagic longline survey undertaken between 2004-2010 in the Indian EEZ, this species represented 5% of sharks caught by number and 6% by weight (Varghese <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys at the Cochin Harbor indicate that this species comprised 11.1% of shark landings by number in 1986-1987 but declined to 1.4% in 2008 (Akhilesh <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).

Similarly, results from interviews with fishermen in the UAE indicate that the majority of fishers started seeing a decline in the abundance of sharks over 20 years ago, and that these declines have been significant (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015b). In Pakistan, catches of this species have decreased by ~70% over the past 20 years (M.

appears to have declined because of the intensive ongoing nature of coastal fishing effort and its desirable meat and fins. There are no species-specific declines, but general declines for sharks, and at time specifically carcharhinid sharks, show declines between 30 and 98% through the species' range outside of Australian waters. Given that the Spottail Shark is one of the most productive shark species, these declines over-estimate the population reduction level of this species, but are indicative of declines nonetheless. The limited catches and healthy populations across northern Australia provide a refuge for the Spottail Shark. With fishing pressure across most of its range stable or increasing, and catches likely declining, it is suspected that the reduction in this species may be close to 30% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) and is assessed as Near Threatened, being close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A2d.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Spottail Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-West Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","This species is retained for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin.

(2018) reported that this species made up 1.04% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong making it one of the most common coastal species encountered in these markets.",Marine,"Very few specific conservation measures are in place for the Spottail Shark over much of its range except Australia. All Australian fisheries that target the Spottail Shark are managed. Catch is controlled by input (restrictions on entry to the fishery, effort, gear, and area that can be fished) and output (Total Allowable Catch (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory)) controls. Management measures maintain catches below levels that will maintain stocks at sustainable levels (Simpfendorfer and Dulvy 2017). Recreational catches of shark are restricted by bag limits, possession limits, and gear restrictions (Johnson et al. 2018). Due to its importance as a commercial target species, in Australian waters the Spottail Shark has been relatively well studied and as a result its biology and response to fishing pressure is well understood. The effect of Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing in Australian waters remains uncertain, but it is suspected that levels have decreased since a peak in the mid-2000s in response to increased border patrols, along with other factors such as the increase in fuel prices and decrease in shark fin prices (Marshall 2011).<br/><br/>There are no other species-specific conservation measures in place in the remainder of its range. However, a number of nations have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in non-target fisheries. Some countries also have bans on specific fishing gears that benefit this species (e.g. United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters). However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting) to which they are more susceptible. India and UAE banned all shark fin export in 2015. Shark finning has also been banned in the UAE, Oman, Iran, India, and Sri Lanka yet trade surveys indicate that some trade in the fins and meat of this species still occurs. Spottail Sharks likely also benefit from the numerous Marine Protected Areas that occur throughout its range. However, no data are available to estimate the benefits they provide, or whether they have reduced population declines. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global
173435173,41831,Loxodon macrorhinus,Near Threatened,A2d,2021,2021-03-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Sliteye Shark (<em>Loxodon macrorhinus</em>) is a small (to 99 cm total length) shark that occurs from eastern South Africa to southern Japan and the Australian east coast, that is, in the Indian Ocean and Northwest and Western Central Pacific. It is demersal on continental and insular shelves at depths of 2–120 m and prefers areas of high water clarity. The species is captured as bycatch and occasionally targeted, in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line, and is retained for its meat, and to a lesser extent for its fins. The population is suspected to be declining across most of its range except for within Australia where there is likely a stable population due to the low to moderate managed fishing pressure. Although the Sliteye Shark is a productive species which likely increases its resilience to fishing pressure, it is subject to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is still common in parts of its Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia regions but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Another small productive shark species, the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>) with a similar spatial and depth range has undergone steep population declines in parts of its range. Declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across more than half of Sliteye Shark’s range are also reported. Taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Sliteye Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2d.","The Sliteye Shark is demersal on continental and insular shelves at depths of 2–120 m (Gutteridge <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Wiegmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 99 cm total length (TL), males mature at 62–66 cm TL and females mature at 79 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gutteridge <em>et al</em>. 2013). It appears to prefer habitat areas of high water clarity (Gutteridge <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2011). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 2–4 pups, an annual reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 40–45 cm TL (Stevens and Mcloughlin 1991, White 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gutteridge <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 1.4 years and maximum age is 8.9 years; generation length is therefore 5.15 years (Gutteridge <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><strong></strong>","<p></p><p></p>The Sliteye Shark is rarely targeted but is captured as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and to a lesser extent, for the low value fins.<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, catches of marine resources reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999, suggesting stocks are fully fished. Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa and Madagascar (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are under-reported and most small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or over-exploited, especially where they are found close to population centres (FAO 2006, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the Sliteye Shark's inshore habitats. For e.g., In Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In Australia, the Sliteye Shark was one of the most commonly captured sharks captured by demersal trawls (Last and Stevens 2009), however spatial and temporal fishery closures have since occurred. The species is now caught in low numbers in gillnet fisheries in Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland (e.g. Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gutteridge 2012).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019).<br/><p></p><span lang=""EN-AU"">","Species-specific population trend data of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was available from northwest Australia (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020). The fishery-independent survey with droplines and longlines from 2002 to 2017 found the CPUE to be fluctuating but overall mostly stable, although there was a high level of uncertainty as the catches were relatively low. The area of the surveys was closed to commercial fishing from 1993 to 2005 onwards and the fluctuating, but overall stable pattern is suggested to reflect either no major detrimental fishing effects on the population even prior to the closures or naturally low abundance that precludes detecting abundance patterns (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020). The CPUE for 2002–2017 (16 years) was analysed over three generation lengths (15 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis revealed a 2.2% annual rate of reduction, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 30.1% over three generation lengths (15 years), with the highest probability of a reduction of &lt;30% over three generation lengths. The high level of uncertainty in the CPUE data is reflected in the trend analysis that also includes high levels of uncertainty (see the Supplementary Information). There are limited threats to this species in Australia where there is low to moderate fishing pressure in managed fisheries, and the population is likely to be stable in its Australian range.<br/><br/>In East Africa, this species was among the most commonly recorded sharks from 2007 to 2012 in a small-scale fishery off southwest Madagscar (Humber <em>et al</em>. 2017). It was also among the shark species most frequently captured in large mesh gillnets off northwest Madagascar, though all shark catches began to decline towards the end of the reporting period of 1990–1998 (Cripps <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, there is very little information on population trends of this species. Anderson and Ahmed (1993) report that the Sliteye Shark was the most commonly taken species by demersal longlines during reef fish surveys (about 70% of sharks caught) in the Maldives. In India and Pakistan, it forms only a minor part of the fishery. For e.g., in 2003–2004, a total of 199 t was recorded from trawl landings in northwest India (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the Gulf, this species is reportedly very uncommon in Iran (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). However, it is commonly taken along the southern coast of the United Arab Emirates (9% of shark landings by number), Qatar (3% of elasmobranch landings by number) and Bahrain (1.6% of elasmobranch landings by number) (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015a). In Oman, it is the third most common species in the overall shark landings (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Henderson and Reeve 2014). In the Sudanese Red Sea, it is taken in artisanal fisheries and there is an inferred decline based on landing site surveys (I. Elhassan unpubl. data 2017). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches. Although the Sliteye Shark is a productive species, the intense level of exploitation and declines in other shark species, leads to a suspected population decline of 20–29% for the Sliteye Shark in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (15 years) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, this species is still considered common in parts of the region, such as Andaman Islands, Malaysia, and Indonesia (K. K. Bineesh, A. Bin Ali, and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020), uncommon elsewhere, i.e., Myanmar (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020), and with possible declines in Viet Nam and Sri Lanka where it used to be captured but has not been recorded recently (V. Q. Vo and D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks and rays are very high in Southeast Asia but have declined and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber et al. 2009). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers. comm. 22 May 2007). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Sliteye Shark in Southeast Asia are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Overall, the population is likely stable in Australia but declining across more than 50% of the other parts of its range. Although it is a productive species which likely increases its resilience to fishing pressure, the Sliteye Shark is exposed to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range, except for within Australia. It is still common in parts of the Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia regions but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Another small productive shark species, the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>), with a similar spatial and depth distribution, has undergone recorded steep population declines in parts of its range (Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2020). This, combined with the declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across more than half of the Sliteye Shark's range, and taking a precautionary approach, leads to a suspected 20–29% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Sliteye Shark occurs from eastern South Africa to southern Japan and the Australian east coast, that is, it ranges across the Indian Ocean and Northwest and Western Central Pacific (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gutteridge <em>et al</em>. 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, White <em>et al</em>. 2017, Arai and Azri 2019, Krajangdara 2019, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, Mariani <em>et al</em>. 2021).","The species is used for its meat which is often consumed fresh but also dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries. Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. In Australia, fisheries are well regulated with limited entry, catch or effort limits, gear restrictions, finning regulations, and size limits. Throughout much of the rest of the Sliteye Shark's range there are few effective regulations that limit the take of this species. Several nations within its range have general regulations that apply to sharks, and the marine protected areas in parts of its range may provide some benefit to the species. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

The closely related and similar-sized Australian Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon taylori</em>) also breeds annually and has a female age-at-maturity of 1 year and maximum age of 7 years (Simpfendorfer 1993); thus, generation length is inferred as 4 years.","<p>  </p>The Grey Sharpnose Shark is targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and to a lesser extent, for the low value fins. In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the Grey Sharpnose Shark's inshore habitats. For example, in Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For example, in Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Indonesia has the highest global catch of sharks (Oakes and Sant 2019). Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2020). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing.<br/><p></p>","In the Arabian Seas, there is some information on population trends of this species. In Kuwait, it accounted for 11.5% of elasmobranch landings by number in 2008, but this had declined to 7.8% by 2011. This may represent a decline in abundance, however the changes may also be confounded by a ban on sale of elasmobranchs at market enforced in 2011 (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). In India, trawl data from Mumbai in Maharashtra indicate declines in landings of this species from 79.8 t in 1999 to 40.3 t in 2005 (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). At the Cochin Fish Harbor, India, in 1981–1982, this species represented between 1.7–2.7% of shark landings, but the species' landings had declined by 2008 to &lt;1% of shark landings (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2011). Elsewhere, there is no data on trends though the species accounts for &lt;1 and 2.4% of elasmobranch catches by number in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, while in Pakistan, it is the third most commonly landed shark species (Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015, M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches. The steep declines in some areas are of concern, but it is not clear if it reflects a decline in abundance as the concurrent effort data is not available and legislation changes could have confounded the observed landings. Although the Grey Sharpnose Shark is likely a productive species, the intense level of exploitation and declines in other shark species, leads to a suspected population decline of 20–29% for the Grey Sharpnose Shark in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (12 years) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, in Indonesia, this species is still considered common in some areas but is now rare in other areas where there has been an anecdotal decline from 2006 to 2019, with only a few individuals captured in the latter years (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). It is uncommon in Myanmar (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, this species accounted for 3.8% of elasmobranch landings in 2012–2013, equivalent to ~210 t (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2015), and has declined to ~120–180 individuals per year since 2017 in the southeast region (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks and rays were very high in Southeast Asia but have declined and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Trawl and gill net fisheries are moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers. comm. 22 May 2007). The stock status of the Grey Sharpnose Shark captures in gillnets in the Java Sea was found to be sustainable in 2015, based on landings data from 2014 to 2015 (Wijopriono and Ernawati 2020). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs elsewhere in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Grey Sharpnose Shark in Southeast Asia are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Overall, the population is suspected to be declining in parts of its range. The Grey Sharpnose Shark is exposed to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range, however, it is a productive species which increases its resilience to fishing pressure. It is still common in parts of the Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia region but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Another small productive shark species, the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>), with a similar distribution across the Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia, has undergone population declines in some parts of that range (Rigby et al. 2020). This, combined with the declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across most of the Grey Sharpnose Shark's range leads to a suspected 20–29% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (12 years) due to levels of exploitation.<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span

It is common in coastal and estuarine waters at depths of 10-75 m, but more typically less than 50 m and prefers muddy and sandy substrates and often occurs near large freshwater outflows. It is highly productive with annual large litters of 6–20 pups, early maturation at two years and a short generation length of 4.5 years. The species is caught mainly by trawl and gillnet in industrial and artisanal fisheries and is retained for human consumption. It is the dominant shark landed in Pakistan, northern India, and Bangladesh and fishing pressure is intense across most of its range. The high productivity of the species and short generation length likely provide it with resilience to fishing pressure, however, the intense and ongoing fishing pressure on this species is a cause for concern. It is suspected that the Spadenose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (14 years) and is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Spadenose Shark is demersal in coastal and estuarine waters at depths of 10–75 m, but mostly less than 50 m (Weigmann 2016, Sen <em>et al</em>. 2019, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). The species prefers muddy and sandy substrates and often occurs near large freshwater outflows. It reaches a maximum size of 91 cm total length (TL), males mature at 24–36 cm TL and females mature at 33–35 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016, Sen <em>et al</em>. 2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). Breeding occurs throughout the year (Devadoss 1979) and females probably mate at least once each year. Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparity, with potentially the most significant placental investment in offspring of all elasmobranchs (Wourms 1993). Litter sizes are 6­–20, with a mean of 13 (Devadoss 1979) and young are born throughout the year after a gestation period of 5–6 months with a size-at-birth of 12–15 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is around two years and maximum age is seven years; generation length is therefore 4.5 years (Nair 1976).","This species is commonly taken in fisheries throughout the Indian Ocean. This includes coastal set gillnet fisheries for a wide range of fish including bony fish and sharks. It is also caught incidentally in demersal trawls for shrimp and fish. In some parts of the region, it is also commonly taken in handline fisheries. Fisheries that catch this species are often small-scale artisanal fisheries, although some trawl fisheries are carried out by commercial and foreign vessels. In some regions (e.g. India, Pakistan) fishing effort on this species has been increasing in recent years. For example, in India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). This number&#160;almost&#160;doubled to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010).&#160;In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017).<p></p>","There are no species-specific population trends. Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). While there is limited species-specific information available on this species in the region, it is marketed for consumption across its range, and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that like many other sharks in the region it has declined. <br/><br/>In Pakistan, it is one of the most commonly landed shark species although over the past 10 years, there has been about a ~30% decline in landings (M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017, 12 December 2020). Similarly, in India, this is one of the dominant shark species caught in the northern states (Kizhakudan et al. 2015). This species is the dominant component of the shark catches in Gujarat, with an annual average landing of 6,364 t, and it represented 67% of shark catch during 2012–2016 (Sen et al. 2019). Recent catches have been stable and a length-based stock assessment suggests the exploitation ratio is around 0.53 suggesting the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring (i.e. E&gt;0.5) (Sen et al. 2019). Annual catches in Maharashtra between 2010–2015 were approximately 3,131 t (G.B. Purushottama pers. comm. to K.V. Akhilesh 9 February 2017). At the Cochin Fish Harbor (Kerala state), in 1981–1982, this species represented between 4.7–8.0% of shark landings, but these landings contributed &lt;1% in 2008 (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2011). In 2003–2004, reports indicate that 11,795 t were landed along the northwest coast of India and 47 t in the southwest (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). Trawl data from Mumbai in Maharashtra indicate declines in landings of this species from 1,269 t in 1999 to 839 t in 2005, and it represented 66% of landed species by weight during the 1991–2005 period (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2015). When scaled to three generation lengths (14 years) of the Spadenose Shark this is equivalent to a population reduction of 85%. In Karnataka, trawlers accounted for 72% of the catch of this species and mostly operated within depths of 10–50 m (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2020) The average catch of Spadenose Shark for the period 2012–2017, was estimated to be 112 t, which formed about 13% of the total shark landing in the region, the average catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was 3.4 kg (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>This species is the most frequently landed shark species in Bangladesh and comprises 58% of shark landings (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This species is mainly taken as bycatch of the Hilsa Shad (Tenualosa ilisha) drift gillnet fishery. A length-based stock assessment suggests the exploitation ratio is around 0.57 suggesting the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring (i.e. E&gt;0.5) (Karim <em>et al</em>. 2017). This species, or one like it, is known from Myanmar and captured with demersal trawls, gillnets and line gears (Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Maung unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Reconstructed catches of mainly carcharhinids are available for the western and northern Indian Ocean and Red Sea (Large Marine Ecosystems 31–34), ranging from Tanzania to Thailand (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Reconstructed catches rose rapidly since the 1960s peaking at a catch of 90,984 t in 1974. Since then catches have declined by 58 over 42 years (1974–2016), with a very steep decline in catch of 48% over 12 years (2004–2016). When scaled to three generation lengths (14 years) of the Spadenose Shark, this is equivalent to a population reduction of 54%.<br/><br/>The species is likely to be resilient enough to withstand moderate fishing mortality and there may be localised stability in catch trends. With increasing fishing pressure across the Indian Ocean region, it is suspected that this species has declined by 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (14 years) and is close to reaching the population reduction threshold due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Spadenose Shark occurs in the Eastern and Western Indian Oceans, from the Gulf of Oman to Myanmar and possibly to Thailand (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Krajangdara 2019).

This species is not present in Sri Lanka (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).

India and Pakistan have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species, however, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g., gillnetting).

It is an anadromous species which undergoes seasonal annual migrations to freshwater to spawn. It does not appear to be overly common, and is considered rare in parts of its range.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is a highly-valued food fish, and has been the subject of artificial breeding efforts in China and South Korea for the purposes of stock enhancement and in order to supply fish for human consumption. This species' dependence on freshwater systems to spawn and its predictable, seasonal mass spawning migrations into freshwater systems render it particularly vulnerable to overfishing. Habitat modification in estuaries is occurring in parts of its range and we infer that these events are contributing to population declines in parts of its range. Some authors have noted population declines in this species, which are currently unquantifiable. This high-value species occupies a shallow depth range (&lt;20 m) and undergoes mass-spawning migrations to freshwater systems, factors which render it particularly vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal areas as well as to overfishing.&#160;It is inferred that this species is dependent on fisheries management, such as off-fishing seasons, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, protected areas, and the increasing reliance on species-specific aquaculture to meet increasing consumer demand which can not be met by wild stocks alone.&#160;<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is conservation dependent and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu</em> genus, and the prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological methods in addition to habitat and population monitoring.","<em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> is anadromous, migrating into freshwater rivers for reproduction during the spawning season.

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver.

Highly-effective fishing gear, including modified longlines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. ocellatus</span> are unknown it has been suggested that populations are declining due in part to over-fishing. It is likely that spawning aggregations of this species, which are found in freshwater, are intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations<br/></span> Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia.

Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Fishes of the genus <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> are relatively recently diverged, and each combination of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu</span> on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Regional threats: environmental degradation and overfishing</span><br/> Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/> This species is anadromous and breeds in freshwater. Several of its known breeding and feeding grounds, including the estuaries of the lower Yangtze river and several downstream lakes have recorded declines in fish biodiversity and shifts in species composition which have been attributed to anthropogenic habitat alteration, river modification (i.e. dam construction), overfishing, heavy metal pollution, deforestation and land erosion (Fu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Zhang<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008, Huang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Chen and Zhu 2008).

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations, which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009).&#160;<strong></strong></p>  <br/><br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>T. ocellatus</em>,&#160;however, it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. ocellatus</em>. Additionally,<em> T. ocellatus&#160;</em>has been bred in captivity to meet increasing demand and to enhance existing stocks.<br/></p>      <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>       <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China Sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><em>Takifugu ocellatus</em> can be found in both&#160; freshwater and marine  protected areas.

This corresponds  with the spawning migration of this species in China, although whether  or not this species spawns in the lake is unknown.

It is demersal on the outer continental shelf at depths of 141–300 m. The species is a bycatch of demersal trawl, deep-water shrimp trawl, and longline gear. There is no local consumption of this species due to its small size, and it is mostly discarded but may be retained at times for animal feed. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure may be rising and extending offshore into deeper waters across the species’ entire range. Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys. This small species may have refuge at depth and in two Marine Protected Areas in the Andman and Nicobar Islands. Overall, it is suspected that the Magnificent Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the last three generation lengths (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Magnificent Catshark is presumably demersal on the edge of the outer continental shelf at depths of 141–300 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 49 cm total length (TL), males mature at 41–48 cm TL and females mature at 39 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is presumably oviparous. Nothing else is known of its biology. There are no age estimates from the family Proscylliidae and related families (i.e. catsharks of the families Scyliorhinidae and Pentanchidae) are difficult to age. The most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) (family Pentanchidae) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2011). This should be treated with caution and as an estimate only as the two species are in different families.","In Myanmar, the Magnificent Catshark is caught in demersal trawl at depths &lt;100 m and by longlines at depths of 70–200 m, although longline captures are rare (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, it has been caught in deep-water trawls targeting shrimp (<em>Plesionika </em>spp. and <em>Heterocarpus </em>spp.) at depths of 300 m off South Sentinel Island (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species is likely either a discarded bycatch or is retained as a 'trash' fish for animal feed mills in Myanmar, but was landed for sale in the Andaman Islands (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015). Post-release survival rate is unknown.<br/><br/>More generally, sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. The inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. The International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014. <br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this is one of the small uncommon sharks caught as bycatch in longline fisheries at depths of 80–300 m (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Very few individuals, less than ten, were encountered during surveys from 2016 to 2019 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). This species may also have been captured in an artisanal deep-water vertical handline fisheries targeting the deepwater gulper and dogfish sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp. and <em>Squalus </em>spp.) for their liver oil. This deep-water fishery operated intermittently between 1988–1992 and used 300–450 hooks per vessels at depths of 200–400 m (Soundrararajan and Roy 2004). Intensive longline and handline fishing pressure targeting groupers and snappers at depths of 50–150 m may catch higher numbers of individuals than the fisheries targeting deep-water sharks (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).","There are limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no landings data to FAO on landings between 1956–1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.3 million t by 2008 (Booth and Pauly 2011). Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950, this increase is concurrent with an increase in fishing effort which infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased, yet surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations and there are significant concerns for the status of many species. Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray species catch rates declined more than for shark species.<br/><br/>This is a small species that may have refuge at depth from intense inshore and trawl fisheries, and in Marine Protected Areas in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in sharks and rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the shallower portion of this species. Overall, it is suspected that the Magnificent Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the last three generation lengths (45 years) and it is assessed as is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).",Decreasing,"The Magnificent Catshark is poorly known and occurs in the Eastern Indian Ocean in the northern Andaman Sea off Myanmar, Thailand, and the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands (India) (Last and Vongpanich 2004, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Tyabji <em>et al</em>. 2018, Krajangdara 2019). The paucity of knowledge may be because this species may be confused with other similar species in the area (Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019).",There is no local consumption of this species due to its small size (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020) but it may be used as a 'trash' fish for animal feed mills (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020).,Marine,"There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, the government established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). The species may have refuge inside the two Marine National parks (Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park and Rani Jhansi Marine National Park) in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available for shark and ray species (to represent the range of possible gears the wobbegong might be caught in) from fisheries within the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). These landings data indicate declines that represent reductions of 36–95% when scaled to three generation lengths (27 years) of the Indonesian Wobbegong. These catch trends are not species-specific or directly from southern Java and Lesser Sunda Islands and the potential occurrence of Indonesian Wobbegong on rocky and coral reef habitats and nocturnal behaviour likely provide refuge from fishing pressure in most areas of its range. Nevertheless, this species is still captured occasionally in trawls is Borneo and artisanal trawl and gillnet fisheries off Bali and Lombok, hence, it is suspected the population has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Indonesian Wobbegong is demersal on the insular and continental shelves (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The depth range is uncertain, but like other coastal wobbegongs we assume the depth range is 0–100 m. It was photographed underwater at a depth of 20 m at Silayakuti Point, Bali, but may have a much deeper depth range as it was observed in fish market in Indonesia landed along with Squalus and triakid species presumably caught by longliners (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010a). In Lombok it has been recorded from depths of &gt;60 m (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020) and it has been caught by trawlers in Sabah, which typically operate at 60–100 m depth (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of at least 120 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016), males mature at ~90 cm TL and females mature at 94–104 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with at least 4 mid-term embryos observed in one pregnant female and size-at-birth estimated as 20 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology. There are no age estimates for wobbegongs and the only data are available from another member of this order, the Whitespotted Bambooshark (<em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>), which in the wild, has an age-at-maturity of 4.5 years, and maximum age estimated at 12.6–14.2 years (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007), and generation length is thus estimated at 9 years.","This species is captured as bycatch of trawl and possibly gillnet fisheries and retained. Four specimens caught by trawl were landed in Kota Kinabalu, Sarawak (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, most fisheries in Lombok fish deeper than 60 m, but this species is caught by very small boats and usually caught together with rays, and typically fishing at &lt; 60 m deep (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is regularly landed in Lombok with several individuals landed each month (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019) and the catch of rays is rising as shark fisheries collapse. In the South China Sea, there has been degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat due to climate change and destructive fishing (Heileman 2009).<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","The population trend of the Indonesian Wobbegong is difficult to ascertain, as there is confusion with another species, the Japanese Wobbegong (<em>Orectolobus japonicus</em>) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This species has been found on coral reefs and, like other wobbegongs, presumably it occurs on rocky and coral reef habitats and exhibits nocturnal behaviour, which likely provides considerable refuge from fishing pressure in most areas of this species distribution. The consequent reduced interactions with fisheries may account for its reported and possible rarity in some areas.<br/><br/>There is no population estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. While not a whipray, the Indonesian Wobbegong is in a similar depth range and may be susceptible to the same trawl gears as whiprays once outside their coral reef habitat. However, Indonesian Wobbegong is more likely to be caught with longlines and gillnets (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020) and the catch of carcharhinid species is also considered. <br/><br/>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Indonesian Wobbegong (27 years), they represent declines of 74% and 95% in Central Indonesia. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of ‘flatsharks’ in the region, though we caution that the wobbegong is more likely to be captured in longline and gillnet gears. <br/><br/>In Indonesia, reconstructed catch data shows catches of carcharhinids increased throughout the mid to late 1900s. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased by 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before it rapidly decreased ~325% in the mid 1990s to 11,500 t, where catch has since remained relatively stable (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s before reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000 and 17,500 t until 2004. After which, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600 and 14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian EEZ of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort. When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Indonesian Wobbegong (27 years), they represent a reduction of 36% based on carcharhinid catches. <br/><br/>These catch trends are not species-specific or directly from southern Java and Lesser Sunda Islands. Nevertheless, this species is still captured occasionally in trawls is Borneo and artisanal trawl and gillnet fisheries off Bali and Lombok and hence, it is suspected the population may have undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) based on actual fishing pressure and is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2d).",Decreasing,"The Indonesian Wobbegong is known from the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific off Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and Malaysia (Borneo) (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016, A.

It has also been recorded in Sulawesi from the Makassar Strait (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is known from a few specimens collected off southeastern Sabah (Semporna) and Sarawak (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010b). There are unconfirmed specimens from Taiwan and Honshu Japan, and there is taxonomic confusion between this species and the Japanese Wobbegong (<em>O. japonicus</em>) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010a).

The species is a discarded bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due to its small size and likely has a low post-release survival rate. Inferred and suspected declines from central Java and are not species-specific and range from 42–70% over three generation lengths (11 years). Based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the Bali Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (11 years) due to levels of exploitation, and is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","The Bali Numbfish is demersal on the inner continental shelf and is currently known from depths of 60–62 m, but is presumably found from the surface down to this depth (Carvalho and White 2016, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 31 cm total length (TL) (Carvalho and White 2016, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is presumably histotrophic viviparity, but relatively little is known of the biology of the species. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data. The Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Bali Numbfish (93 vs 31 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 3.5 years for the Bali Numbfish.","In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong></strong>","There is no population estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. While not a whipray, the Bali Numbfish occurs in a similar depth range and is susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of numbfishes.<br/><br/>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016).

With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007).<br/><br/>In general, there are not many fish landings along the south coast of Java. There are some areas where there is very low or no fishing pressure along the south coast of Java that may be refuge areas for the species (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Bali Numbfish (10.5 years), they represent reductions of 42% and 70% in Central Indonesia. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Bali Numbfish. Dramatic declines have been documented in populations of similar species, where they are heavily fished. Considering these catch trends are not species-specific or directly from southern Java and Lesser Sunda Islands, the suspected population reduction of the Bali Numbfish in Indonesia is 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (10.5 years).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in the Eastern Indian Ocean off southern Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands (Carvalho and White 2016, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Numbfishes are not consumed as human food and are presumably discarded due to their small size (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).,Marine,"No specific measures are in place.

It is only known from four specimens. It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 60–160 m. The species is likely a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including demersal trawl and gillnets and is likely retained for human consumption. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys, with steeper declines in rays than for shark species. This small species may have some refuge at depth and may also benefit from mesopredator release and hence it may not have declined as steeply as larger species.

Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the Yellow-spotted Fanray that, in Taiwan, has a female age-at-maturity of 4.1 years and maximum age of 20 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Hsieh 2011).","Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. This species is captured using demersal trawl and gillnets (Psomadakis <em>et al.</em> 2019). In coastal waters prior to a nationwide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<p></p>","There is limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956–1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small Exclusive Economic Zone (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950, this increase is concurrent with an increase in fishing effort which infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased, yet surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations and there are significant concerns for the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray species catch rates declined more than for shark species.<br/><br/>This small species may have some refuge at depth from more intense inshore fisheries and may also benefit from mesopredator release and hence it may not have declined as steeply as larger species.

It is necessary to note, however, that there is no formal monitoring data for relative abundance of this species. It is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for <em>A. bicolor</em> be conducted across its range to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal in conservation. <br/> <br/> Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel.

The growth rate of <em>A. bicolor</em> leptocephali collected in the eastern Indian Ocean, west of Sumatra, was slower than other tropical eels, such as <em>A. celebesensis</em> or <em>A. borneensis</em>, suggesting that this subpopulation have a longer leptocephalus stage during oceanic migration (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). Year-round spawning has been suggested to occur for <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Indian Ocean (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a</em>) and almost throughout the year in the Pacific (Sugeha <em>et al.</em> 2001, Sugeha <em>et al.</em> 2008). Individuals recruiting to Indonesia are thought to be coming from two or three different spawning seasons and/or sources, possibly including North and South Pacific spawning locations (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sugeha and Suharti 2008, Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2008<em>,</em> Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> This species has been observed to have elongate nostrils of a yellow/orange colour, that have been hypothesised to act as lures for prey (Tweddle and Skelton 2016). <em>A. bicolor</em> spends most of its life in estuaries, brackish waters, freshwater lakes, streams, pools and small rivers, preferring marshy habitats but can also be found over rock bottoms and in deeper pools (Pethiyagoda 1991). Chino and Arai (2010) found two patterns of habitat residence in eels from Segara Anakan, central Java Island in Indonesia. No eels were found to display solely freshwater residence, whilst 25% solely existed in either brackish or sea waters. The other 75% displayed habitat shifting between freshwater and either brackish or sea waters. In Africa this species is noted as preferring lowland coastal reaches of river systems (Skelton 1993) and in the Arabian Peninsula to wadis, estuaries and the coastal habitat (EPAA 2002). Similarly, in the Cagayan River, Philippines, it is thought that <em>A. bicolor</em> is found more commonly to reside in tributaries closer to the mouth of the river (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2018). In Vietnam, <em>A. bicolor</em> were found to show no freshwater residency during growth phase after analysis of Sr:Ca ratios suggesting either sea water or estuarine residency or migrating between brackish to sea (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2013). In a lagoon in Indonesia, individuals tended to migrate between freshwater and sea water with no constant freshwater residence (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017). Hamzah <em>et al</em>. (2015) found most of the sampled <em>A. bicolor </em>in Peninsular Malaysia to display <a name=""_Hlk17467906"">high gonadosomatic indices</a>, suggesting they were ready to begin the spawning migration. This possibly indicates that they might remain entirely in freshwater before migration to the ocean to breed. However, Arai and Kadir (2017<em>b</em>) found <em>A. bicolor </em>to be widely distributed in both upstream to downstream areas of rivers in Peninsular Malaysia. Most recently, Arai and Chino (2019) investigated migratory history of <em>A. bicolor </em>collected in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. <em>A. bicolor </em>in Indonesia and Viet Nam were found to be either marine or brackish resident, whereas in Malaysia, it was freshwater resident (Arai and Chino 2019). Overall <em>A. bicolor </em>appears to show opportunistic, flexible habitat use and migration strategy during the growth phase, possibly in response to local conditions. </p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> can grow to a maximum size of 1.1 m (Gomon and Bray 2017). However, while this species can live for up to 20 years, the average age of silvering is younger than those of temperate eels, suggesting that growth is faster (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2011). A variety of studies have examined the reproductive ecology of <em>A. bicolor </em>in Peninsular Malaysia. Arai <em>et al</em>. (2011) found age of female silver eels ranged between four and six years, with a total length of 497 to 636 mm, and weight ranging from 205 to 497 g. Another study found age at maturation of females ranged between 5.5 and 8.5 years, with body length and weight ranging from 411 to 720 mm and 126 to 1125 g, respectively (Chai and Arai 2018). On Penang Island off Peninsular Malaysia, migrating female silver eels were found to have an average total length and body weight of 651 mm, and 593 g respectively (Kadir <em>et al</em>. 2017). Glass eels of <em>A. bicolor </em>recruiting to Réunion Island in the western Indian Ocean were found to be 54 ± 2.1 mm long (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> From research conducted on the Pacific subpopulation of <em>A. bicolor</em> in the Dumoga River, North Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, the ages of glass eels at recruitment to the coast ranged from 124 to 202 days, with hatching being estimated as having occurred between November and March (Arai <em>et al</em>. 1999). The duration of metamorphosis was estimated as 20 to 40 days (Arai <em>et al</em>. 1999). In the Poigar River, North Sulawesi, <em>A. bicolor </em>was only present in samples in January, March, April, October and December (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2001). Mean age at metamorphosis and recruitment was estimated to be 141 ± 20.9, and 173 ± 20.9 days, respectively (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2001). Based on year-round recruitment of glass eels at the Poigar River mouth, and age at recruitment remaining constant throughout the year, year-round spawning may exist for <em>A. bicolor</em> (Arai 2000, Arai 2001). </p><p>Average total length of <em>A. bicolor </em>glass eels recruiting to Mindanao, Philippines was 48.8 mm (45–52.3 mm) (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). Two specimens of metamorphosing leptocephali - 42.6 and 46.3 mm - were reported off the Indonesian Archipelago and their ages were estimated as 106 and 112 days, respectively (Kuroki <em>et al.</em> 2006). During a sampling survey from Sumatra in 2003, <em>A. bicolor </em>leptocephali were collected west of Sumatra in the Mentawai Trench (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). Otolith microstructure of these larvae revealed size and age ranges of 44.1–55.5 mm and 114–158 days respectively (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007). The transport of <em>A. bicolor </em>larvae is likely to be heavily influenced by the South Equatorial Current (SEC), the South Equatorial Counter Current (SECC) and the South Java Current (SJC) (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p><p>Kadir <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated the fecundity range (millions of eggs) for <em>A. bicolor </em>to be 0.6 to 5 and relative fecundity (millions of eggs per kilogram of body weight) was 3.1. </p><p>          </p><p><em>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>To date, few studies or surveys have considered the threats facing this species. Across the range of <em>A. bicolor</em>, there are documented threats affecting all anguillid eels. In Northern Luzon, Philippines, there is concern over pollution resulting from agricultural run-off, sediment erosion and mining (Ame <em>et al.</em> 2013). Farming practices occur along the Cagayan River, and run-off may well be affecting eels in this aquatic system (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2018). In Sulawesi, mining for gold takes place, possibly affecting anguillid species in this area through mercury pollution (Muhammad <em>et al</em>. 2012, Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2017, Octaviano 2017). Anguillid eels have been suggested as reliable indicators of contaminant concentrations within surface waters (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>). In a study on <em>A. bicolor </em>from Malaysia, cadmium, copper, nickel and zinc were found below the acceptable limits of heavy metal pollution in fish and shellfish, although lead was higher than the global standard (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>). Even at low levels, heavy metals are toxic (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>b</em>), and <a name=""_Hlk10034760"">can impact anguillids metabolism, in some cases leading to mortality</a> (Le <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>Major impoundments and weirs are barriers to upstream eel movement in all countries within <em>A. bicolor</em>’s range (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011) and mortalities can occur during the downstream passage of silver eels through turbines and pumps, and impingement on intake screens. For example, an irrigation dam in the Karau River, Malaysia, may prevent upstream/downstream movement of yellow stage <em>A. bicolor </em>(Arai <em>et al</em>. 2012<em>a</em>). In the Poso river watershed in Indonesia, dams for hydropower and unsustainable harvest of glass and larger eels are two reported threats (Watupongoh and Krismono 2015). <a name=""_Hlk10102978"">Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), present a threat to eels and other recruiting fish (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</a></p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited. The Philippines are significantly affected by typhoon activity, which has been increasing, most likely as a result of climate change (Holden and Marshall 2018) and may have the potential to reduce habitat quality. Significant localised damage caused by typhoon activity has been observed in some tributaries of the Cagayan River system (M. Gollock pers. comm.). </p><p>Parasitic infection by the invasive swim bladder nematode <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> has also been observed in <em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor </em>and<em> A. marmorata</em> from Reunion (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). Two <em>A. marmorata </em>(n = 80), one <em>A. bicolor</em> (n = 23) and one <em>A. mossambica</em> (n = 15) were infected (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). While the infection prevalence was low in these samples, this parasite is known to spread extremely quickly (Kirk 2003).</p><p>            </p><p>A major concern for <em>A. bicolor</em>, is believed to be the growing exploitation of this species across much of its range, particularly for glass eels (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em> </em>Over the last decade<em> A. bicolor</em>&#160;has been fulfilling some of the demand for eels for consumption in East Asia driven by declines in other species (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015, Nijman 2015, Shiraishi and Crook 2015). Increasing exploitation is expected to continue due to the reduced availability of <em>A. japonica</em> and <em>A. anguilla</em> in particular, and there are concerns over illegal trade from several countries in Southeast Asia where glass eel exports are not permitted (see Conservation). In a study investigating illegal trade in the Philippines, <em>A. bicolor </em>made up 87% (20 out of 23) of randomly selected elvers identified after confiscation - the remaining three were identified as <em>A. marmorata </em>(Asis <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla bicolor</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>In historic studies conducted in southern Sri Lanka, the population was stated to be relatively stable as reflected in the catch per unit effort (Wickström and Enderlein 1988, Wickström 2006).&#160;Population densities of this species are very low in the Arabian Peninsula (EPAA 2002).&#160;In the Philippines, multiple species of glass eels, including <em>A. bicolor</em>, recruit to the coast and abundances appear to fluctuate annually and regionally (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). </p><p>Sugeha <em>et al</em>. (2001) studied the inshore migration of glass eels to the Poigar River estuary (North Sulawesi, Indonesia) over a three-year period from 1997–1999. <em>A.</em><em> bicolor</em> was found to recruit almost year-round, although in the lowest abundance compared to <em>A. celebesensis</em>, and <em>A. marmorata </em>(Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001). <em>A. bicolor </em>made up only 2.7, 1.7, and 0.3% of the annual catch, respectively (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2001). In contrast, <em>A. bicolor</em> was recorded to be the dominant species recruiting to the estuary of Palu River (West Sulawesi, Indonesia) from 2006 to 2007, compared to <em>A. marmorata </em>and <em>A. celebesensis</em> (Sugeha <em>et al</em>. 2008). Aoyama <em>et al</em>. (2015) sampled glass eels in the Cagayan River, Philippines, from 2008 to 2009, and again in 2011 to 2012. In 2008–2009, <em>A. bicolor</em> made up only 3.9% (of 8,643 glass eels), which increased to 29.5% (of 23,535 glass eels) in 2011–2012 (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). Another study in the Cagayan River system conducted monitoring over a twelve-month period from May 2015 to May 2016 and found <em>A. bicolor</em> to make up only 10% of recruitment in a mixed system with <em>A. marmorata</em> (44%), and <em>A. luzonensis</em> (46%) (Zoological Society of London, unpub. data.) In the Pangi River, Maitum Sarangani Province, Philippines, <em>A. marmorata</em> was dominant, making up ~97% (4,118 of 4,262 eels) of catch, whereas <em>A. bicolor</em> was less common, only making up ~3% (139 of 4,262 eels) (Valdez and Castillo 2016). In Southern Mindanao, Philippines, glass eels were collected over a year period between April 2014 and May 2015, <em>A. bicolor</em> was the second most abundant species, making up 19.5% of catch (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>In Palabuhan Ratu, Indonesia, eel catch and effort data (CPUE) has been recorded since November 2013 (SEAFDEC 2018). This data is not species specific, however it has been suggested that the dominant species caught in the Cimandiri River is <em>A. bicolor </em>(SEAFDEC 2018). Although there is no overall trend across this time series, there are three periods where CPUE peaked; October 2014 to September 2015, October 2015 to September 2016, and January to April 2017 (SEAFDEC 2018). In a study of glass eels recruiting to Palu River in Sulawesi, <em>A. marmorata</em> was dominant, constituting just over half of catch (51%), <em>A. bicolor</em> made up 36% (Serdiati <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p><p>        </p><p><a name=""_Hlk14865245"">In Réunion, <em>A. bicolor</em>, as well as other recruiting anguillid eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em>, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>), are classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the regional Red List (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009). Listed threats include fisheries (target species and bycatch), habitat loss, construction of barriers to migration, and parasites (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;</a></p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor</em> has diverged between the Indian and Pacific Oceans giving rise to two subpopulations (Ege 1939). The subpopulation found in the Indian Ocean (sometimes referred to as <em>A. bicolor bicolor</em>) is genetically homogeneous in this ocean, but significantly different from that in the Pacific Ocean (sometimes referred to as <em>A. bicolor pacifica</em>) (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2012). There is also continued debate about whether the Indian Ocean subpopulation might also be considered as two separate management units (K. Tsukamoto pers. comm. 2014). Watanabe <em>et al</em>. (2014) suggested each spawning population “should be considered a distinct ecological unit for conservation and sustainable management”.<br/> <br/> The Pacific subpopulation is native to the coasts of mainland China (hereafter China), Taiwan, Province of China (hereafter Taiwan), Viet Nam (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Hue, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Nha Trang (Nguyen 2018)) (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2011), Philippines (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the islands of Borneo, Sulawesi Island, New Guinea, and the Marianas (Tesch 2003 in Nguyen 2018). In Taiwan, it has been suggested to be an occasional species with low abundance (Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hong <em>et al</em>. (2017) recently identified one specimen in the Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) waters. A study by Sugeha and Suharti (2008) conducted around the Indonesian Archipelago, found <em>A. bicolor</em> to be distributed along the archipelago from the west to the east.&#160;<em>A. bicolor</em> recruited in Sulawesi, Halmahera, and West Papua Islands of eastern Indonesian archipelago (Sugeha and Suharti 2008).<br/> <br/> The Indian Ocean subpopulation is distributed from the east coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula (Oman and Yemen, including Socotra, in coastal drainages of the Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, and Gulf of Aden (EPAA 2002)), it is widespread in the tropical Indian Ocean (Seychelles, Madagascar and Mascarenes), east to India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar. It is found across to northwestern Australia but known only from streams in the Kimberley regions of northwestern Western Australia and Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Indonesia, <em>A. bicolor</em> has been found to recruit to Sumatra and Java Islands of the western Indonesian archipelago (Sugeha and Suharti 2008, Sugeha and Genisa, 2015, Muchlisin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Suryati <em>et al</em>. 2018). A number of recent studies also support the occurrence of <em>A. bicolor </em>from the Indian Ocean subpopulation in the Malaysian Peninsula (Arai <em>et al.</em> 2012<em>a</em>, 2015; Hamzah <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arai and Wong 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). In Africa, it is widespread but relatively uncommon along the east and southeast African coast from South Africa to Tanzania and Madagascar, including the Lower Shire River System of the Lower Zambezi in Malawi (Tweddle and Willoughby 1979) and Tana River in Kenya (Copley 1958). In a study identifying eels from Madagascar and surrounding islands, <em>A. bicolor</em> was the only anguillid species collected in the Seychelles archipelago (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/> <br/> The exact spawning locations of <em>Anguilla bicolor</em> are unknown. Studies have long thought the spawning location of <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Indian Ocean lies to the west of Sumatra above the Mentawai Trench (Jespersen 1942, Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Aoyama <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007). A second western spawning location has been hypothesised to exist to the east of Madagascar (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kuroki <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2007, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although, the utilisation of a single spawning area is supported by a population structure showing this species to be genetically homogenous throughout the Indian Ocean (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Fahmi 2013). It is therefore likely that eels in the southwest Indian Ocean may be coming from the same spawning area as those recruiting to Sumatra (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). <em>A. bicolor </em>in the Pacific Ocean<em> </em>is thought to spawn somewhere in the North Equatorial Current region, near the Mariana Ridge, possibly overlapping or near to that of <em>A. japonica</em> (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2018, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, South Korea and China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). <a name=""_Hlk17384264""><em>Anguilla bicolor </em>was increasingly used to stock farms in East Asia from 2010 onwards (after <em>A. anguilla </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2009 and the EU banned all trade in <em>A. anguilla </em>from and to the EU), and in particular when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to shortages in 2011–2013.</a></p><p>According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~220 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from eight countries in south-east/south Asia (&gt;70% from the Philippines), reaching a peak of around 64 t in 2013, and 14 t from Africa (99% from Madagascar, see below). China and South Korea farming input data includes some specific records of “<em>A. bicolor </em><em>+</em><em>” </em>(believed to include mainly <em>A. bicolor, </em>but also some other tropical species): in mainland China “<em>A. bicolor +</em><em>” </em>input gradually increased from 0.3 t in 2008–2009, reaching a peak of 13.5 t in 2013–2014; South Korea also began to use <em>A. bicolor </em>in 2010–2011, input reaching a peak of 6.7 t in 2012–2013. Both trade and farming input data suggest that the demand for <em>A. bicolor </em>and other tropical eels in East Asia has declined since 2014 as successful farming techniques for <em>A. bicolor </em>and other species have not yet been fully developed (Fan and Qin 2016, Back and Park 2017). However, there appears to have been an increase in <em>A. bicolor </em>farming in Indonesia and the Philippines in recent years (SEAFDEC 2018). It should also be noted that exports of glass eels from most south-east Asian countries are not currently permitted (see Conservation).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160; </p><p><em>Anguilla bicolor </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited. At best it is reported as an approximate percentage of catch/trade and only available for part of its range. Within south-east Asia, Indonesia and the Philippines are currently the principal <em>Anguilla</em> catching, farming and trading nations (SEAFDEC 2018). Annual catches of “River eels nei” (other eel species not included elsewhere in FAO fishery statistics) in Indonesia and the Philippines fluctuated between 1355 and 6125 t between 2008 and 2017, averaging over 3000 t per year. According to national surveys coordinated by SEAFDEC, in 2017 total Indonesian glass eel catch (a mix of <em>A. bicolor </em>and <em>A. marmorata</em>) was ~20 t, and annual elver and yellow eel catches in 2015 and 2016 (no data available for 2017) was ~700 t (SEAFDEC 2018). The mouth of the Cimandiri River in Sukabumi Regency is considered to be one of the largest glass eel fishing grounds in Indonesia, with more than 1,500 part-time fishermen active in the peak season (Honda <em>et al. </em>2016). Fahmi and Hirnawati (2010) concluded that 86% of the glass eel caught in the Cimandiri River was <em>A. bicolor</em>.&#160; There are 12 eel farms currently operating in Java, and 90% of total production (354 t in 2015 and 511 t in 2016) is reportedly <em>A. bicolor </em>(SEAFDEC 2018). </p><p>In the Philippines, the main target species for fisheries is <em>A. bicolor, </em>however<em> </em>the main species caught in Luzon and Mindanao is <em>A. marmorata </em>(85–90% of all glass eels, 95% of yellow eels). 2017 glass eel catches were reported as 2.2 t in Luzon and 10.3 t Mindanao. There are 28 eel farms currently operating in the Philippines and in 2016 they produced 114 tonnes - 20% <em>A. marmorata </em>(exported to China, South Korea and Taiwan) and 80% <em>A. bicolor</em> (exported to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan). Apparently, farmers are specifically looking for species mixes with a high percentage of <em>A. bicolor</em>, glass eels are sorted and most of the <em>A. marmorata </em>is released back into the wild. In other south-east Asian nations, anguillid eel catch and use is small in comparison, and in many cases only as bycatch species, e.g. yellow eel bycatch in Myanmar was reported as 12 t in 2017 (90% <em>A. bicolor</em>, 10% <em>A. marmorata </em>or <em>A. bengalensis</em>). Due to the high diversity of tropical fish in south-east Asia and the perception that anguillid eels look like snakes and/or have mythical status (Mekong Fisheries Network 1999) domestic consumption is minimal, apart from in Viet Nam, which uses 50% of its anguillid production (95% <em>A. marmorata</em> and 5 % <em>A. bicolor</em> farmed from domestic glass eel catch, ~0.6–0.75 t a year) for domestic consumption (SEAFDEC 2018). In some parts of its range, such as Sri Lanka, <em>A. bicolor</em> is also reportedly used in the aquarium trade (Pethiyagoda 1991).</p><p>International trade in <em>Anguilla</em> commodities is reported from much of <em>A. bicolor’s </em>range, however, the species composition of shipments is unknown and could contain many different <em>Anguilla </em>species including <em>A. marmorata, A. bengalensis </em>and<em> A. mossambica. </em>According to UN Comtrade, exports of eel commodities (live, fresh, frozen and prepared eel) from south-east and south Asian countries increased from ~8,420 t in 2008 to 32,640 t in 2016, with live and frozen eels being the main commodities for export. However, live eel exports from south-east Asian countries in particular are known to include non-<em>Anguilla </em>eel species such as <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels) and <em>Pisodonophis </em>spp. (Gollock <em>et al.</em> 2018, SEAFDEC 2018). For example, verified exports from the Philippines in 2016 were only 48 t (all apparently identified as <em>Anguilla bicolor pacifica</em>), compared to the 8,423 t reported to UN Comtrade. Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius also exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t). According to UN Comtrade, exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous, however exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species <a name=""_Hlk10101152"">(S.

In May 2012, as a precautionary measure by the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) legislation was enacted to prohibit the export of juvenile anguillid eels of a size less than 15 cm from the Philippines, (Crook 2014). In the Cagayan River, located in the north of Luzon island in the Philippines, an eel management plan has been developed (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019). This has been proposed as a model for replication in other islands/regions, and even nationally (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019). </p><p>Indonesia has legislation relating to export of glass eels that dates back to 1973; in October 2012 a new regulation came into force (Nijman 2015). The “Regulation on the Export of Glass Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.) from the Republic of Indonesia (PP 19/2012)” stipulates that the individual mass of eels exported from Indonesia must equal or be larger than 150 g, and so despite its title, encompasses glass eels, elvers, and some yellow eels (Nijman 2015). In Vietnam Anguilla eel export is banned except for farmed eels (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2018, a nine-year conservation and management plan for Anguillid eels in Réunion was produced (Valade <em>et al</em>. 2018).

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>&#160;is found in fresh and saline water habitats of East Africa, Madagascar and other West Indian Ocean island chains. Documented threats to this species include barriers to migration (Mafuca and Bills 2012), parasites&#160;(Sasal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Weyl&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, McHugh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), and the growing exploitation of this species in Madagascar and South Africa, for export to Asia and Europe (Robinet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a decline in range of ~50% over three generations (30 years) has been estimated in some rivers in the province (C. Hanzen unpub. data). Elsewhere in South Africa, there is anecdotal evidence of declines in the Eerste River catchment in False Bay due to poor water quality, and the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay where recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). In Réunion Island, this species occurs frequently in some rivers, whereas in Mayotte, <em>A. mossambica</em> are considered scarce (Valade <em>et al</em>. 2018, DEAL and OCEA 2019). Dam construction has also thought to have led to declines in Tanzania (Tamatamah 2012). In the Cahora Bassa Lake, Mozambique, eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) were found to be absent where historical studies had reported them as extant prior to dam construction (Mafuca and Bills 2012).</p>  <p>If observed range declines in some areas are reflected in other regions across the distribution of this species, there would be significant cause for concern. This, coupled with growing interest and demand for this species for farming and consumption, has led to&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em> being assessed as Near Threatened (NT). The listing for this species is based on inference from limited data across a small range and it is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal in conserving the population.</p>  <p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup>&#160;of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>In South Africa this species inhabits a broad ecological niche, being found in rivers from the headwater to lower reaches (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015; Kadye and Booth 2019). Similar to other anguillids, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is catadromous, whereby a proportion of the growth phase (yellow eel) reside in freshwater and the other remaining in sea, coastal, or brackish habitats (Tsukamoto 1998, Lin <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elvers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa arrive in considerably higher numbers in the summer (November/December) than during the winter (June/July) or spring months (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Although yellow eels are usually fairly sedentary, otolith microchemistry suggests that some individuals in South Africa are inter-habitat migrants that move between freshwater and saline habitats (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012). In a later study using otolith Sr:Ca ratios, Lin <em>et al</em>. (2015) found 16.7% (n = 5) of individuals in the Maningory River, Madagascar, to exhibit freshwater residency, and 13.3% to be habitat-shifters (n = 4).</p><p>Females can attain lengths of up to 120 cm and are generally longer and heavier than males (Froese and Pauly 2011). This species is thought to remain in the yellow stage for 8–18 years before metamorphosing into the silver stage, prior to beginning the spawning migration (McEwan and Hecht 1984, Bruton <em>et al</em>. 1987 in Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015).</p><p>It has been suggested that spawning of this species occurs continuously between June and November in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). The age of leptocephali increases as they are found further south of the proposed spawning area and it is suggested that individuals are transported by the South Equatorial Current (SEC) (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). The present continental range suggests a migration of 1,000 to 2,000 km from the proposed spawning area (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Of the three species that inhabit the Malagasy area (<em>A. mossambica</em>,&#160;<em>A. marmorata</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>A. bicolor</em>),&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em>&#160;have the slowest otolith growth rate due to its southernmost distribution (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>        </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; <span lang=""EN-US"">barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments.</p><p>Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cahora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). However, in both the Sundays River (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Baakens River (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2015) in South Africa, <em>A. mossambica</em> was found upstream of the obstructions, and in both studies was the only species able to transverse the weirs. </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17467190"">In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</a></p><p>Fisheries for eels based in Madagascar, Mozambique, and South Africa appear to be increasing, and over the last 15 years, glass eels have been increasingly exported directly from Madagascar to East Asia (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). There are also concerns over illegal fishing and trade in the region (see Use and Trade). Weyl <em>et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that the trade of live <em>A. mossambica</em> may result in parasitic introductions into other regions, as a result of its rich parasitic fauna. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa this species is particularly vulnerable to a parasitic gill worm (<em>Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae</em>) (Parker <em>et al</em>. 2011, McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). This parasite has been shown to cause damage to gills resulting in impaired respiration (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under aquaculture conditions, where fish are kept in high numbers, infection has led to mortalities (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). <a name=""_Hlk17468384"">Parasitic infection by the invasive swim bladder nematode <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> has also been observed in <em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor </em>and<em> A. marmorata</em> from Reunion (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). Two <em>A. marmorata </em>(n = 80), one <em>A. bicolor</em> (n = 23) and one <em>A. mossambica</em> (n = 15) were infected (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). While the infection prevalence was low in these samples, this parasite is known to spread extremely quickly (Kirk 2003).</a></p><p>          </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our knowledge of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>A study investigating niche patterns in native and non-native fish within The Great Fish River (South Africa) described <em>A. mossambica</em> as having broad environmental niches and being widespread (Kadye and Booth 2019), which is similar to what has been found in the Sundays River, Eastern Cape (Wassermann <em>et al</em>. 2012). In a study of 4099 glass eels sampled between April 2005 and February 2006 from rivers in Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Madagascar, 3790 <em>A. mossambica, </em>246 <em>A. marmorata</em>, and 63 <em>A. bicolor</em> were identifiable (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009a), indicating the latter was a small proportion of the recruitment to these islands at the time.</p><p>Other recent monitoring data has been collected from South Africa between 2015 and 2019, predominantly in KwaZulu-Natal (C. Hanzen unpub. data.). A comparison of historical (Scott <em>et al</em>. 2006, GBIF 2018) and current data from the samples collected across this province was carried out. Using this method, the decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) was 51% over three generation lengths, and 59% over the full time series (1959-2019). These records indicate a decline in distribution – and very likely abundance – of this species in some rivers of KwaZulu-Natal. This pattern, if reflected in other areas across the range of this species, would be significant cause for concern.</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing surveys carried out over the past decade only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</a> <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em> once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S.

In Mayotte, <em>A. mossambica</em> are considered scarce (OCEA 2014).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>This species is endemic to countries bordering the southwest Indian Ocean. Along the east coast of Africa, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is found in rivers from Kenya south to Table Bay (South Africa), also found on Madagascar and other western Indian Ocean islands (Mascarene: Réunion and Mauritius Islands, Comoros:&#160;Mayotte Island and the Seychelles: Mahé and Praslin Islands). <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,&#160;is also the most common anguillid species in the Eastern Cape, South Africa and in eastern Madagascar (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>  </p><p>Spawning is thought to occur in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan<a name=""_Hlk17467804"">, The Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) </a>and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global production of <em>Anguilla </em>has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). Being a plain-coloured eel, there has been an increase in interest in <em>A. mossambica </em>to stock farms in East Asia and elsewhere from 2010 onwards (after <em>A. anguilla </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2009 and the EU banned all trade in <em>A. anguilla </em>from and to the EU), and in particular when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to shortages in 2011–2013.</p><p>According to East Asian Customs data, the first known records of imports of live glass eels into Asia from Africa are from 2005, and between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar). Live eel fry imports from Madagascar (believed to be mainly composed of <em>A. mossambica</em>) reached a peak of 5.6 t in 2013, after which they dropped to less than 600 kg in 2014 and 2015, with no imports recorded in 2016–2017. South Korea reported farming input 0.5 t of <em>A. mossambica </em>in 2012–2013 (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018); South Korea tried farming <em>A. mossambica </em>and <em>A. bicolor </em>when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to their shortage during 2011–2013, most of which was reportedly unsuccessful (Fan and Qin 2016, Back and Park 2017).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla mossambica </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited. No country from the species’ range has reported eel catch or farming data to FAO, however in recent years there has been a reported increase in interest in commercial harvesting of eels (all life stages) from South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar, with a focus on <em>A. mossambica</em> for export to Europe and Asia. Illegal fishing and trade of glass eels has been reported from the region, and this has been linked to several applications for setting up eel farms in South Africa mainly using <em>A. mossambica</em> imported from Madagascar, all of which have been rejected by national authorities over concerns of disease, introduced parasites and population status (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). An increase in investment into fisheries and farming of eels in Madagascar and Mauritius, in particular of <em>A. mossambica</em>, has been reported over the last decade (FIS 2010, Farm Africa 2015) and Malagasy eel farmers are advertising their products on B2B marketplaces/trade platforms such as Alibaba. There has also recently been a proposal to farm <em>A. mossambica</em> in aquaculture facilities in Michigan, USA (Wyam-Grothem <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>          </p><p>International trade in <em>Anguilla</em> commodities is reported from <em>A. mossambica </em>range states, however, the species composition of shipments is unknown and could contain many different <em>Anguilla </em>species including <em>A. marmorata, A. bengalensis </em>and <em>A. bicolor. </em>According to UN Comtrade<em>, </em>Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t). Exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous. However, exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species (S.

This suggests their spawning season may extend for at least six months of the year (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). </p><p>    </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>In India and Bangladesh in particular, harvesting of this species occurs, but it is not known what impact fishing is having on the overall population. As a mottled species, <em>A. bengalensis</em> is perhaps less desirable to the East Asian market, where plain coloured eels are generally preferred. There is, however, a growing market for mottled eels, although to date this is mainly for <em>A. marmorata</em> (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).&#160;</p><p>The Conservation Assessment and Management Plan (CAMP) report on the freshwater fishes of India (Molur and Walker 1998) declared <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Endangered’ according to IUCN criteria. In Bangladesh, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was assessed as ‘Vulnerable’ resulting from population decline attributable to “habitat loss and perceived over-exploitation for export” (Islam 2015). Threats reported to be affecting this species in both localities, were damming, fishing, loss of habitat, invasive species, disease, pollution, climate change, overexploitation and domestic trade (Molur and Walker 1998, Shrestha 2003, IUCN Bangladesh 2015). In Nepal specifically, most dams do not have fish and/or eel ladders, and loss of freshwater habitat is a significant problem (Shrestha 2003). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17376556"">Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cabora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). </a>In Malawi, Nkula Dam is located on the Shire River (Mzuza <em>et al</em>. 2017), which may limit available habitat and movement. In Tanzania, the construction of large dams is also thought to have contributed to eel declines (Tamatamah 2012) Within the Arabian region, vagrant individuals of this species are known from a single location in the Wadi Hajr river, which is dammed 3–4 km from the mouth, possibly blocking upstream access for eels (Attaala and Rubaia 2005, Freyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p><p>In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>In 2012 a new species of parasitic nematode was discovered in the intestines of&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> collected from the freshwater bodies of Kerala State in southern Indian (Moravec <em>et al</em>. 2012). In some parts of India, this species has also been found to contain levels of pollutants that could be toxic to humans. In the Ganges River, West Bengal for example,&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> specimens that were caught contained methyl mercury concentrations that were higher than the limits set by the PFA (Provention of Food Adulteration Act) for human consumption (Pal <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;</p><p>            </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited <a name=""_Hlk17376667"">(Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015)</a>.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk6388497"">There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</a></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian freshwater systems, and in particular in Nagaland and Assam. In 1998, this species was classified as ‘Endangered’ in India in accordance with a decline in AOO (area of occupancy) and a decline in the extent and/or quality of habitat (Molur and Walker 1998). During a systematic sampling survey carried out between 2004 and 2006 in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (a large river system in Kerala), its relative abundance was deemed 'rare' across the ten sampling locations (Radhakrishnan and Kurup 2010). The IUCN Red List of Bangladesh assessed <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Vulnerable’ within its regional assessment (Islam 2015). This is due to a suspected population decline of 30% over the last ten years, resulting from habitat-loss and unsustainable exploitation (Islam 2015).</p><p>For other localities, there is limited information.&#160;There is some anecdotal evidence for localised extirpation in Africa, for example in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe where fisherman, in 1998, reported no freshwater eel had been found since the construction of a large hydroelectric dam in 1959 (S. Watanabe pers. comm. 2014). In Manyame River, Zimbabwe, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was described as “formerly more numerous”, with individuals having not been collected or caught more recently, possibly indicating decline as a result of dams (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, also as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing trials carried out over the past decade have only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (<a name=""_Hlk17375676"">S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019</a>). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, river surveys for anguillid eels combined with historical distribution data found <em>A. bengalensis</em> not to be present in areas where they were previously extant (C. Hanzen unpub. data).</a> Since 2000, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. bengalensis</em> have disappeared from longline sample catches in some catchments in Western Cape. One example is the Breede River, home to the invasive catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), and so this may be a result of predation (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Similar to <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica, A. bengalensis </em>may have once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>        </p><p>In Réunion, <em>A. bengalensis </em>(listed under the redundant synonym <em>A. labiata</em>), as well as other recruiting anguillid eels (<em>A. bicolor</em>, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>), are classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the regional Red List (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009). Listed threats include fisheries (target species and bycatch), habitat loss, construction of barriers to migration, and parasites (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is found in Pakistan, India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and Nagaland (Tsurang River)), Bangladesh, Nepal (Gandaki, Koshi, Karnali, Mahakali), Sri Lanka, Myanmar, South Africa (Sympatric with <em>A. marmorata</em> in the Western Cape), Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Eswatini (Komati river system), Lake Kariba, Middle Zambezi and its larger tributaries on the plateau, Limpopo (Umzingwane River and Inyankuni Dam), Pungwe, Buzi, Upper and Lower Save/Runde systems in Zimbabwe. It is also found in Lake Malawi and its catchment area as well as the Shire River and its tributaries and the eastward flowing Athi and Tana drainages (Seegers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). In Ethiopia <em>A. bengalensis</em> has been reported from the middle reaches of the Genale River catchment in the southwest of the country and is currently the only anguillid species found in the country (Golubtsov <em>et al</em>. 2012). An electrofishing study conducted in upper estuaries of the Seychelles, Mayotte, Mauritius, Reunion and the east coast of Madagascar recorded no <em>A. bengalensis</em> out of 4,172 collected eels (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008). Most recently, this species’ range has been extended to Aceh in Indonesia (Muchlisin <em>et al.</em> 2017), and north-western Peninsular Malaysia (Arai 2014, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arai and Wong 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a,b</em>). There are also occasional records of vagrant individuals in the Arabian Peninsula (Wadi Haj in Yemen; Ataala and Rubaia 2005). </p><p>  </p><p>There remains some uncertainty surrounding where freshwater eels including&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> spawn in the Indian Ocean. Indeed, compared to other species, very few leptocephali have been gathered for&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em>&#160;and it is still not known whether this species has a single, or multiple spawning locations, or whether spawning location overlaps with other anguillids (see Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2014 for discussion).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, the Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar) and 7.6 t from Bangladesh (all in 2014). There is, however, no information suggesting that <em>A. bengalensis </em>is currently used (or there are plans to use it) in eel farms in East Asia.</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited and no catch data has been reported to FAO by any of its main African or Asian range States. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian inland waters and is of considerable commercial value in India and the Andaman Islands. On local markets in both India and Bangladesh <em>A. bengalensis</em> is only sold during the yellow or silver eel stage; live eels (greater than 100 g) of this species, originating in Bangladesh, are being offered for sale on B2B marketplaces/trade platforms. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em><span class=""a0""> is harvested in small quantities (on average between one and six specimens a day per fisherman) in the Ganale Dawa river basin in Ethiopia (Abelti <em>et al. </em><span class=""a0"">2014). Yellow eel bycatch in Myanmar was reported as 12 t in 2017 with 10% of this believed to be <em>A. marmorata </em><span class=""a0"">or <em>A. bengalensis </em><span class=""a0"">(SEAFDEC 2018). Other uses of the species include treatment of arthritis, piles and meningitis in India (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Chanu <em>et al.</em><span class=""a0""> 2014). In addition, <em>A. bengalensis</em><span class=""a0""> is considered a 'pristine rare ornamental species of the Himalayan drainage' often being preserved in temple ponds for religious purposes (Shrestha 2003).<span class=""a0""></span></span></span></p><p>        </p><p>International trade in <em>Anguilla</em> commodities is reported from much of <em>A. bengalensis’s </em>range, however, the species composition of shipments is unknown and could contain many different <em>Anguilla </em>species including <em>A. bicolor, A. marmorata and A. mossambica. </em>According to UN Comtrade, exports of eel commodities (live, fresh, frozen and prepared eel) from south Asian countries increased from ~1,330 t in 2008 to ~5,170 t in 2015 (however, data is incomplete and this may be an underestimate), with live (from Bangladesh) and frozen eels (from India) being the main commodities for export. Myanmar reported exports live eels in 2010, 2014 and 2016, totalling ~10,900 t, however, live eel exports in the region are known to include other non-<em>Anguilla</em> eel species such as <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels). Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius also exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t). Exports of live eels (all life stages) from Madagascar increased gradually from 4.6 t in 2004 to 8.8 t in 2009 and then in 2010 there was a dramatic increase in exports to over 45 t. From 2011 to 2015 annual exports fluctuated between 16t and 26 t, and in 2016 and 2017 they declined again to ~11 t. Companies trading in the southern and east Africa region declare that their glass and adult live eels are <em>A. mossambica</em> and that they are able to differentiate between species and control harvesting as glass eel recruitment is asynchronous, however exports to East Asia of live eels caught in Madagascar, Mozambique and South Africa have been reported to include other species (S.

177163701,39328,Squatina californica,Near Threatened,,2020,2014-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina californica</em>) occurs off the coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico (including the Gulf of California), where it is associated with soft bottom habitats. It grows slowly and matures late in life (8-13 years), has an estimated generation length of 11.7-17.0 years, and&#160;produces an average of six pups per year. Based on these life history characteristics and the potential for isolation due to patchy habitat distributions and restricted movement patterns, resident stocks of Pacific Angel Shark may be vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially harvested in California beginning in the late 1970s. In response to a decline in landings, management measures (including a ban on nearshore gillnets and&#160;minimum size limits) significantly reduced the landings in California and these landings have stabilized at low levels over the past decade (2005-2014). In Mexico this species is still fished, and logbooks have been required in targeted shark fisheries since 2006. The population trend remains unknown, but reported landings data (2003-2015) from Baja California suggest that landings declines of &gt;99% may occur within three generations if current trends continue. While landings data cannot be equated with population declines, fishing pressure in Mexico has likely remained relatively stable over time. Given that this species is taken in targeted elasmobranch fisheries in Mexico,&#160;and that landings have declined under stable fishing pressure, this species is globally assessed as Near Threatened, with a suspected population decline approaching 30% over three generations. In the United States, however, this species is considered Least Concern, as the threat of targeted commercial fishing has ceased, and ground fisheries along the west coast of the United States are managed.","Pacific Angel Shark are relatively small, benthic elasmobranchs, that are commonly found in soft bottom habitats, including shallow bays and estuaries, as well as around rocky reefs and kelp forests (Feder <em>et al</em>. 1974, Ebert 2003). It lives in relatively shallow waters to depths of 100 m, but it is much more abundant in nearshore, coastal waters (Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983). They are fairly residential, restricting their movements to a small geographic area, possibly on the order of 150 ha or 375 acres, with the potential to make longer distance movements (Ebert 2003, Love 2011). For example, one Pacific Angel Shark tagged in Catalina Island was recaptured three and a half years later at Santa Cruz Island, a distance of approximately 100 km (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). They are generally quiescent during the day, often remaining buried in the sediment, but become quite active and hunt during the night (Pittenger 1984, Leet <em>et al</em>. 1992, 2001; Castro 2011). They appear to exhibit a high degree of site fidelity, with reports of sharks having preferred foraging and resting locations (Standora and Nelson 1977, Love 2011).<br/><br/>Numerous techniques of ageing and age verification have been used on Pacific Angel Shark, but none except tag-recapture have been successful at estimating their growth rates or age-specific processes (Natanson and Cailliet 1990, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). These tag-recapture data, however, allowed an estimate of von Bertalanffy growth and demography parameters that predicted relatively slow growth and moderate fecundity, with maturity occurring relatively late in life. Off California, males and females begin to mature between 90-100 cm total length (TL), with an average reproductive age of 8-13 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpublished data 2005). All males and females larger than 103 cm and 112 cm, respectively, are mature (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). In the Gulf of California, Pacific Angel Shark mature at a smaller size, 75.6 cm for males and 77.7 cm for females (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Age at maturity of the Pacific Angel Shark in California is around 10 years, but ranges from 8 to 13 years (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). The reproductive mode of this angelshark is aplacental viviparity. Females give birth to 1-13 pups (average six) after a 10 month gestation with pupping occurring between March and June (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Ebert 2003). Size at birth is approximately 25 cm TL (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). Maximum reported length is 152 cm TL for females and 118 cm for males (Natanson 1984), and maximum length in the Gulf of California was estimated at 99 cm TL (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Maximum age is around 22-35 years (Natanson 1984, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005). Generation length is estimated to be 11.7-17.0 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005).","Historically, the Pacific Angel Shark was discarded at sea or used as bait, but in the 1970s a commercial fishery in California began targeting this species. A rapid increase in Pacific Angel Shark landings between 1983-1986 occurred in California (Richards 1987), leading to concern that stocks could be overexploited. Even though a minimum size was proposed for the gillnet fishery targeting both California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) and Pacific Angel Shark, this measure proved not to be effective at reversing the declining population levels along the Santa Barbara/Ventura coast and Channel Islands areas, California (Richards 1987, Cailliet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Additionally, it was observed that declines in landings were occurring prior to the implementation of these management strategies indicating the over-exploitation of the species within the region (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In Mexico this species is caught in fisheries targeting elasmobranchs. Fishing effort in Mexico is challenging to quantify, as some fishers hold licenses but are inactive, while others may share a single license among multiple vessels (Sosa-Nishizaki, pers. comm. 2016). This species is now absent from regions in Baja California Sur where it was historically found in catches (Laguna San Ignacio and Bahia Magdalena), and there is also evidence for depensation in this region (Ramirez-Amaro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).","No information on stock size or structure has been documented for the species. However, three genetically distinct populations have been described off of the west coast of the United States within the California Channel Islands (Northern Channel Islands, Southern Channel Island, and along the mainland) that are most likely separated by deepwater channels (Gaida 1997). It has also been suggested that populations on the Pacific side of Baja California are distinct from that of the Gulf of California (Ebert 2003). Currently, support for these possibly divergent lineages has not been provided and the existence of distinct genetic subpopulations from throughout the eastern Pacific distribution of the species has not been assessed. Because of its rather limited geographical range and evidence of only limited exchange among regional stocks within this range, resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially fished in California beginning in the late 1970s. In 1977 landings totalled 0.15 metric tones (mt), and during the expansion phase of the commercial fishery for this species, landings rose dramatically to 117 mt in 1981, and to 277 mt in 1984. Landings peaked and began to decline from 426 mt in 1987 to 112 mt in 1990. While declines were observed around this time, these declines were not strictly a reflection of population declines, as a minimum size limit was proposed in 1987 and became law in 1989 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). In 1991, a 50% decline in effort occurred in response to bans on gill and trammel nets in California. This also had a dramatic effect on the landings, which dropped to 8.62 mt in 1995 and 8.16 mt in 1997, but then increased to 15 and 24 mt in 1997 and 1999, respectively. At the same time that landings were dropping in California, a Mexican gillnet fishery began targeting Pacific Angel Shark in 1997, with estimated landings of close to 163 mt in 1999 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). More recently, landings in California have stabilized at around 6.81 to 4.04 mt from 2005 to 2014 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000-2014).<br/><br/>Little is known about the effect of fisheries on the population of the Pacific Angel Shark in Mexico, but landings in some areas have declined and researchers have detected changes in size composition. Fisher interviews conducted along the coast of Baja California also suggest that catches have declined over time (Sergio Ramirez, pers. comm., 2 December 2016). Logbook data from the demersal trawl fleet in San Felipe, Baja California report catches of 663 to 6,375 kg from 2009-2013. Data on landed weight of the Pacific Angel Shark from Baja California reported to Bahia de Los Angeles are available over twelve years (2003-2015; CONAPESCA). These data suggest that landings have declined steadily from a peak of 83,778 kg in 2012 to 16,173 kg in 2015, representing a decline in landings of &gt;99% over three generations (2003-2057) if fishing continues at the same rate (CONAPESCA). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to detect, but effort is estimated to be relatively stable. Species-specific landings data are also available for Sonora state, but no trends in landings are yet clear (CONAPESCA).<br/><br/>A survey of landings of artisanal fishers targeting elasmobranchs was conducted in Sonora, Mexico (Gulf of California) from 1998-1999. Pacific Angel Shark constituted 1.3% of the total chondrichthyan landings, increasing to 3.3% in winter, which was considered ""a notable contribution"" by the authors (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Surveys were also conducted on the Gulf of California side of the Baja peninsular and found Pacific Angel Shark to constitute 11.6% of the total chondrichthyan landings (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Along the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula, an artisanal fishing community survey conducted between 2006 and 2008, determined that this species made up 1.86% of the total elasmobranch landings (Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011). In a survey focusing on the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, this species was found to make up 5.6% of the elasmobranch catch (a catch-per-unit-effort of 1.82 individuals per vessel per trip; Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Angel Shark occurs off the coast of North America from Alaska to the tip of Baja California, Mexico (including the Gulf of California), and&#160;is particularly abundant in central and southern California (United States) waters, especially off the coast of Santa Barbara (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, 1990; Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992, 2001) and off El Barril, Baja California (Castro 2005).&#160;It was previously reported that the&#160;South Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina armata</em>) was a possible synonym of this species, but&#160;this has largely been confirmed to be a separate species (Stelbrink&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Further evidence to support that Pacific Angel Shark does not occur in Chile was provided in a recent checklist for elasmobranchs in Chilean waters, where South Pacific Angel Shark but not Pacific Angel Shark was reported to occur (Bustamante <em>et al</em>. 2014).",This species is valued for its meat.,Marine,"The northeast Pacific population of the Pacific Angel Shark appears to have stabilized, at least in the waters of California.&#160;A ban on gillnet fisheries that targeted the California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) was voted into law by Californians in 1990&#160;(Proposition 132). Through this ban, the fishery is indirectly regulated (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1992, Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992). Additionally, a minimum retention size limit became law in 1989, which decreased the juvenile catch and overall harvest on exploited stocks.&#160;Drift gillnet fisheries are also prohibited off the coast of Washington state.<br/><br/>Further north, along the United States west coast (Washington, Oregon and California), ground fisheries are managed by a federal Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Although this species is not a focal species of the plan, and no species-specific data on the Pacific Angel Shark will be collected, other&#160;chondrichthyans&#160;are being managed under this program.<br/><br/>In Mexico, some fisheries are required to record species-specific data under the category of ""angelito"" (Pacific Angel Shark) in logbooks.

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span><span style="""">&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016). <br/></span>","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Maculate Panray that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and while population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. Average elasmobranch landings in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that this species is still relatively abundant across its range. The pattern of retention and discarding of panrays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The Maculate Panray has only been recently described and records are likely to be aggregated with, and undifferentiated from, the Striped Panray (<em>Zanobatus schoenleinii</em>). In fact, records across its known range are limited despite ongoing fisheries monitoring surveys investigating shark and ray landings. However, this is also likely due to discard patterns since this species is very small, difficult to skin, and therefore unlikely to be retained for local consumption. In Western Ghana, approximately 10 individuals were landed per day at sites visited during surveys in 2019 and 2020, representing 7% of ray landings, although these records are likely aggregated with Striped Panray (<em>Zanobatus schoenleinii</em>) records (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). It has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in Nigeria during research surveys; in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although there are records of the Striped Panray there); in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019; and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (P. Doherty, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). This lack of records could either be due to biogeographic absence, its poorly known status (the species was only described in 2016), or species depletion, although the latter seems unlikely given the small size of the species and the low interest in its utilization. Therefore, the real reason for this lack of records cannot be determined at this point and further monitoring is warranted. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, panrays are relatively commonly captured, and they are also infrequently recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets, but these records might also be aggregated with the Striped Panray which are mostly discarded alive (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Maculate Panray has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (17 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).<br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Maculate Panray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;to Angola (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;Séret 2016).&#160;It has not been recorded from&#160;São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).","Information on the use and trade of the Maculate Panray is not available. However, its congener, the Striped Panray (<em>Zanobatus schoenleinii</em>) is either discarded or retained as utilized bycatch across its range. In some countries like The Gambia, it is often found discarded on the beach and not utilized&#160;because even though their meat is edible, it is small and difficult to skin (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006, Last<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). However, in Mauritania, it is processed (salted and dried) for export to Nigeria where it is used for local consumption (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In Senegal, interviews with fishers indicate that the Striped Panray is always landed because its meat is in demand. It is considered tender and is consumed fresh or dried and salted and more expensive than other species of rays (e.g.,&#160;<em>Fontitrygon</em>&#160;spp.) (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Considering the smaller size of the Maculate Panray, it is likely that it is mostly discarded across its range.",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species.&#160;Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Maculate Panray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. Countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020).

Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau (Sobrino&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;As part of their tuna SFPA, The Gambia also allows three deep-water demersal trawls to fish&#160;for hake species at depths of 150–850 m (European Commission 2020).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).

It occurs only in the High Seas off the southern Emperor Seamount Chain (south of 35°N) and is demersal and epi-pelagic on seamounts at depths of 100–525 m. The species is a likely bycatch of deep-water demersal and pelagic trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries, and possibly retained for its meat and liver oil. Historically, fishing pressure across its range was intense and unregulated during the 1960s to 1980s, however, fishing effort has since reduced and is now managed by the North Pacific Fisheries Commission. The species is likely susceptible to overfishing and its highly restricted distribution and capture is of concern. However, over the past two generation lengths of the Boretz's Dogfish (42 years), fishing effort has declined and is managed. It is suspected that Boretz's Dogfish has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (63 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2d).","Boretz's Dogfish is demersal and epi-pelagic on seamounts at depths of 100–525 m (Dolganov 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 95.2 cm total length (TL), males mature at 61 cm TL and females mature at 77 cm TL (Dolganov 2019). Reproduction is viviparous with pregnant females observed with 2–3 near full-term embryos and size-at-birth estimated at 23 cm TL (Dolganov 2019). Nothing else is known of its biology. Generation length is inferred from a closely-related species, the Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>), which has a female age-at-maturity of 19.3 years and a maximum age of 22 years, resulting in a generation length of 21 years (Siao 2010).","The species may be taken as bycatch in demersal and pelagic trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries on the Emperor Seamounts.

Commercial catches of this species are unknown, and it is unknown if it is retained or discarded. The fisheries in the region have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019).

It is not targeted or retained. It is large-bodied and other large-bodied species of similar size have declined under relatively light fishing pressure.NT A2d, globally VU as 2/3 of habitat in Atlantic<br/><br/><em><em>OLD TEXT</em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em> is a medium sized (to 96 cm TL), wide-ranging skate from the Southwest Atlantic off Uruguay, Argentina and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and more rarely recorded off Chile in the Southeast Pacific. This species is known from a wide depth range (between 55 m and 861 m) with higher densities at depths that differ latitudinally in the Southwest Atlantic. It is reportedly taken as bycatch in deepwater benthic trawl teleost target fisheries and also in the <em>Dipturus chilensis</em> directed skate fishery off Argentina. There is little species-specific trawl landing information available but fishing pressure off Argentina has increased substantially over the past decade and in 1999, there was a decrease in the captures of rays by the deep sea fishing fleet of around 15% with regard to 1998. A decline in the biomass of <em>B. albomaculata</em> captured during fishery-independent investigations at 45° to 55°S was also reported off Argentina from 1998 to 1999, however the second phase of investigations employed gear which likely reduced the capture of rays. In longline fisheries targeting <em>Dipturus chilensis</em> off Argentina and Chile, they are thought to comprise up to 10% (on deeper water trips) and &lt;5% of the landed catch, respectively. In the multispecies skate trawl fishery north of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, <em>B. albomaculata</em> is the second most important species forming 28% of the catch. In the early 1990s the fishery experienced dramatic declines, especially in the southern area which was closed to the rajid fleet in 1996. Between 1993 and 1997 <em>B. albomaculata</em> replaced <em>B. griseocauda</em> as the dominant species in the catch in the northern fishery area. A recent assessment of the northern ray population, utilizing observer data, has shown no significant trend in CPUE for this species. There have been no studies to determine the abundance of <em>B. albomaculata</em> in the southern area since the rajid fishery closure; however, it is also caught as bycatch by finfish trawlers that operate around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and within the southern rajid closure. In an extensive study of the abundance of <em>B. albomaculata</em> in the Southwest Atlantic between 1998 and 2003, the species was generally absent between 48°S and 52°S, where it was formerly abundant, coincident with heavy fishing pressure in the area. <em>B. albomaculata</em> displays slow growth and late maturity and can be susceptible to overfishing if not closely monitored. Although more information is required to assess the magnitude of past declines, the vulnerability the species has shown to overfishing in the past and the continued fishing pressure through much of its range justifies an assessment of Vulnerable, on the basis of observed and inferred past and suspected future declines.","The Broadnose Skate is demersal on the inner continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 28–604 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann&#160;2016). It reaches a maximum size of 125 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). There is geographic variation in size-at-maturity: females mature at 67 cm TL and males at 65.4 cm TL in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (Paesch and Oddone 2009), whereas females mature at 57.9 cm TL and males at 63.9 cm TL in the&#160;Falkland Islands (Malvinas)&#160;(Arkhipkin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). As in other skates, reproduction is oviparous (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Female age-at-maturity is approximately 8 years and the maximum age is 20 years; generation length is therefore estimated to be 14 years (Arkhipkin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).","<p>In the Southeast Pacific, the Broadnose Skate is caught infrequently as bycatch of the target longline fishery for Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) off Chile. This fishery operates at depths of 30–300 m, mainly at the upper end of the Broadnose Skate depth range (Lamilla <em>et al. </em>2001, 2002). Landings for the fishery comprised 85% Yellownose Skate and 10% Roughskin Skate (<em>D. trachydermus</em>), with the remaining 5% made up of other skates including this species (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002).

Stock status assessments are not,  however, species-specific and a sustainable total allowable effort for  the entire stock may not translate to sustainable levels of effort for  individual species (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000).

There is little to no known fishing effort in the Northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean that reaches these depths. <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of the Portuguese Dogfish&#160;were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Leafscale Gulper Shark,&#160;<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>)&#160;in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;Since the introduction of TAC of zero in 2010, it is likely that discarding and misreporting of the species has increased (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;In 2014, 50% of sampled specimens collected from longliners and landed as the Tope Shark,&#160;<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>, were found to be Leafscale Gulper Shark or Portuguese Dogfish (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region.&#160;Deep-water sharks, which may include the Portuguese Dogfish, were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Somniosid sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal offshore trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In Suruga Bay, Japan, historic exploitation peaked during World War II when the species was utilized for its liver oil (Stevens and Correia 2003). In recent years, the species is infrequently reported from the region (S. Tanaka, unpubl. data 2019) and this may be attributed to refuge at depth. The&#160;Portuguese Dogfish has been reported in the region from depths &gt;750 m (Yano and Tanaka 1987), and current fishing operations, including&#160;a&#160;deep-water dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>), which operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). A<a>&#160;semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019). </a><br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Of the ~1,800 t of deep-water shark catches reported in the Southern Indian Ocean in 2016, ~1,300 t was the Portuguese Dogfish (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The species is also occasionally reported from demersal longline fisheries operating on the Kerguelen Plateau (Chazeau<em> et al. </em>2019).</p>","<p>Population genetics indicate low genetic variability and migration of individuals between the east Atlantic and Pacific populations, but have indicated there is a separate population in the Mediterranean (Catarino<em> et al. </em>2015). Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic from Marine Scotland Science (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) and (2) relative abundance from Canadian trawl surveys in the Northwest Atlantic (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019).&#160;The&#160;time series data were analyzed over three generation lengths (111 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, nominal CPUE from Scottish trawl surveys suggest&#160;no trend in CPUE between 1998–2012, but increasing CPUE from 2013 to 2019 (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019).&#160;The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 10.2% consistent with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the three generation lengths.&#160;In addition, commercial landings of deep-water dogfishes in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~11,000 t in 2003, before rapidly declining to 220 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES 2015). <br/><br/>Secondly,&#160;the trend analysis of relative&#160;abundance in the Northwest Atlantic between 1992–2013 (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019)&#160;revealed an annual rate of decrease of&#160;2.7%, consistent with an estimated decrease of&#160;95.1% over three generation lengths (111 years), with the highest probability (61%) of&#160;≥80% reductions in population over three generation lengths. These results are likely to be an artefact of sampling rather than trends in true abundance; most captures of the species occur at depths &gt;900 m (Halliday&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and sampling in this region occurs at depths between&#160;20–1500 m (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Portuguese Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations. Importantly, causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). <br/><br/>Across the regions, the Portuguese Dogfish&#160;was suspected to be declining across West Africa and increasing in recent years in the Northeast Atlantic.&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""FR""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 4.9%, with the highest probability of no major&#160;reduction over three generation lengths (111 years). However, trends are unavailable for &gt;50% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 20–29% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Near Threatened&#160;(close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"The Portuguese Dogfish has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).",The species has been utilised for its flesh and liver oil.,Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Portuguese Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). The species is considered a ""key species of concern"" within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Portuguese Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius</em>&#160;spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005. <br/><br/>In Australia, deep-water sharks, including the Portuguese Dogfish, are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, divided into eastern and western zone fisheries&#160;(Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). These fisheries are subject to Total Allowable Catches (TACs). A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.</p>","",,false,false,Global
