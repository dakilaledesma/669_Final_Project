20887241,18384,Prototroctes oxyrhynchus,Extinct,,2014,2014-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The New Zealand Grayling (<em>Prototroctes oxyrhynchus</em>) is assessed as Extinct. It was endemic to New Zealand, where it  was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the  North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement  in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued  rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some  streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North  Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas,  it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely  encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to  the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not  noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn  and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again  in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a  variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The  roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of  factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration  of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover  resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature  and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species&#160;was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. Hector (1871) reported of immense and conspicuous shoals ascending the Hutt River (southern North Island) in January. Apparently, however, signs of decreasing numbers were evident soon afterwards. The disappearance of the fish from the Waikato River (North Island) was noted to have occurred in 1874. In 1878, Rutland (who studied the species in the Nelson and Marlborough district, South Island), noted that in the Maitai River (n the north of the South Island) it had 'become very scarce during the past three years'. This disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. There are reports of this species being caught in the 1920s and in the early 1930s a specimen (possibly the last), was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010, Best 1929, Radway-Allen 1949).",Unknown,"The New Zealand Grayling (<em>Prototroctes oxyrhynchus</em>) was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori prior to European settlement and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing.
