1288745,170183,Chrysoblephus cristiceps,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2014,2009-12-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em> is endemic to South Africa and was historically a significant component of the commercial and recreational linefish catch in some areas of its distributional range. This species exhibits life history characteristics that make it vulnerable to over-exploitation including slow growth, longevity, late maturation, hermaphroditism and restricted home range. This species changes sex at a size of about 43 cm FL and, although a minimum landing size of 40 cm TL has been implemented, it is lower than the size at sex change and thus affords limited protection for males.&#160;There is strong evidence for a decrease in mean size and age-at-sex change in exploited areas. Furthermore, sex ratios are skewed with fewer males in areas of heavy exploitation. Overall catch rates have declined drastically since the 1930s, and more recent CPUE shows that catch rates have continued to decline (~50% between 1985–2007). CPUE has declined significantly throughout its range except in the Tsitsikamma National Park. CPUE in the Port Alfred commercial linefishery declined significantly &#160;from 0.69 kg per fisher per hour to less than 0.1 kg per fisher per hour<sup> </sup>(decline of ~85%) from 1998 to 2007. There has also been a drastic decline in percent composition by mass from ~65% from the 1940s to the 1960s to 2.5% &#160;in 1987 in the Port Alfred linefishery (greater than 96% decline). Similar declines have been observed in other parts of its distribution (e.g., in the Southern Cape): 11% in 1931–1933 to 2% in 1987–1993. The observed decrease in catch composition after 2005 is attributed partly to conservation measures such as: increase in the minimum landing size and the decrease in commercial and recreational bag limits. The stock is considered as collapsed based on per-recruit analyses conducted from 1980–1986. Standardized abundance indices provide evidence that for a decline by more than 95% from 1998 to 2011 across the entire range of <em>C. cristiceps </em>(within three generation lengths). Given that there is currently no moratorium in place to prevent the threat of further population decline, this species is listed as Critically Endangered under A2bd.","<p><em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps </em>adults are found on offshore reefs between 20 and 100 m depth (Buxton and Smale 1984, Buxton 1987), while juveniles occupy subtidal reefs from 10 to 30 m depth in the Southeastern Cape (Buxton 1987). Tagging results suggest that individuals are fairly resident although there may be some nomadic movement between reefs (Buxton and Allen 1989, Buxton and Smale 1989, Griffiths and Wilke 2002, ORI Tagging Project unpublished data).<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;</span>This species&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>is a benthic carnivore feeding on a wide variety of reef-associated invertebrates (Buxton 1987). The maximum length recorded for this species is 70 cm TL (van der Elst 1993) and it has a maximum age of 22 years (Buxton 1993). Growth parameters of this species in the Southeastern Cape were estimated at L∞ = 654.7 mm FL, K = 0.081 and t<sub>0</sub> = -2.35 (Buxton 1993).</p><strong>Reproduction</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em>&#160;is a protogynous hermaphrodite (Buxton 1989), with sex change occurring at approximately 43.5 cm FL (Buxton 1990).&#160;Size at 50% maturity occurs at between 27.5 cm and 36.5 cm FL for females and age at 50% maturity is 7.7 years for females and 11 years for males (mean age at sex change). <em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em>&#160;is a reef spawning species with a spawning season between October and January (Buxton 1990).&#160;<strong></strong><br/><br/>Generation length for <em>C. cristiceps</em> is estimated to be 11 years, using the following equation for a protogynous fish species: Generation length =SR* (Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)+(Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)","<em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em> is vulnerable to exploitation as it is slow growing, long-lived and exhibits hermaphroditism (Buxton 1992, 1993) and has experienced significant population declines throughout its distributional range (Buxton and Mann 2013) including a fishery collapse (Buxton 1993). Individuals of this species are recruited into the fishery before maturity as sex change occurs around 43 cm FL and the minimum landing size is 40 cm FL (Buxton 1990, Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012) resulting in heavier fishing pressure on males than females. This species is currently considered to be heavily overexploited (Griffiths 2000). Skewed sex ratios have been observed in areas with higher fishing effort with fewer males observed (Buxton 1993). Major threats include localized overexploitation by recreational and commercial linefishers particularly close to major metropolitan areas (Griffiths 2000).","<p>The&#160;<em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps </em>stock&#160;is currently considered to be collapsed (Buxton and Mann 2013).&#160;Per-recruit assessment showed that the <em>C. cristiceps</em> population off the Port Elizabeth area in the Eastern Cape had already collapsed in 1986 with a spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) of&#160;&#160;~5% in the Port Elizabeth area while SBPR was ~54% in the Tsitsikamma Coastal National Park (TCNP) (Buxton 1993). There is strong evidence to suggest that the catch per unit effort (CPUE) for <em>C. cristiceps</em> has declined throughout their distributional range except in the TCNP (Crawford and Crous 1982, Hecht and Tilney 1989, Buxton 1993, Griffiths 2000). Commercial linefish catches throughout the range of <em>C. cristiceps</em>&#160;from 1984 to 2007 indicate a decline in excess of 50% over a period of 23 years (National Marine Linefish System&#160;unpublished data). CPUE in the Port Alfred commercial linefishery declined significantly from 0.69 kg per fisher<sup> </sup>per hr to less than 0.1 kg per fisher<sup> </sup>per hr<sup></sup> (decline of ~85%) from 1998 to 2007. The decline after 2005 is believed to be primarily due to the implementation of stricter fishing regulations including an increased minimum size limit of 40 cm TL and a reduced daily bag limit of one fish per person per day applying to both recreational and commercial fishers&#160;(Donovan 2010). For this reason, an additional analysis was conducted using Generalized Additive Models to standardize the probability of capturing <em>C. cristiceps</em>&#160;along the South African coast (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2014). The modelling framework was based on an approach described in Winker <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2013), which was developed to correct abundance index for the effects of targeting and spatial and seasonal variations. The probability of capture is widely used for rare species and is considered to be more defendable than catch rates in weight because of it being less sensitive to management regulations such as catch restrictions by bag limits. The trends for the period 1985-2010 show that the capture probability of <em>C. cristiceps </em>declined from 8% in 1985 to less than 0.1% in 2011 between Cape Point and Tsitsikamma, and from 24% to less than 0.1% along the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coast, corresponding to declines of more than 95% across its South African range. &#160;</p><p>There has also been a drastic decline in the percentage composition by mass from ~65% from the 1940s to the 1960s to 2.5% &#160;in 1987 in the Port Alfred linefishery (Hecht and Tilney 1989). Similar declines have been observed in the southern Cape such as 11% in 1931 to 1933, to 2% in 1987 to 1993 (Griffiths 2000). A further decline in catch composition was also observed in the Port Alfred linefishery with <em>C. cristiceps</em>&#160;decreasing from an average of 28% of the sparid group from 1985 to 2001 to 8.5% between 2002 and 2007. The decrease in catch composition was partially a result of the increase in minimum landing size and the decrease in commercial and recreational bag limits in 2005 (Donovan 2010). Recent data show that the total commercial catch for this species has declined since 1992 from approximately 25 tonnes/annum to a current level of less than one tonne/annum since 2004.</p><p>There is strong evidence for growth overfishing in the form of a decrease in mean size and age-at-sex change in exploited areas (Hecht and Tilney 1989, Buxton 1993) as fish are recruited into the fishery before maturity. Buxton (1993) showed that sex ratio was skewed towards females and mean size was lower in exploited areas. The adult M:I:F sex ratio from 1978-1986 was 1:0.2:2.3 (East London area), 1:0.2:4.4 (Woody Cape to St Croix), 1:0.6:3.8 (Tsitskamma National Park) and 1:0:24 (Knsyna to Mossel bay) (Buxton 1993).</p><p>  </p>",Decreasing,"<em>Chrysoblephus&#160;cristiceps</em> is endemic to South Africa from Cape  Point to Durban in KwaZulu-Natal (Fischer and Bianchi 1984, Smith and Heemstra 1986, van der  Elst 1988) with a few large specimens  recorded as far north as Richards  Bay in KwaZulu-Natal (P. Garratt pers. comm. 2009). The depth range for this species is 20 to 100 m (Buxton and Smale 1984,&#160;Buxton 1987). This species is rarely caught in KwaZulu-Natal waters and is more common in the Eastern and Western Cape (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).&#160;<br/><br/><em><br/></em>","<p><em></em><em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em> is important to commercial and recreational skiboat linefisheries in the Eastern and Western   Cape (Crawford and Crous 1982, Smale and Buxton 1985, Hecht and Tilney 1989). However, a decline in abundance and strict species-specific regulations have reduced the importance of this species in the commercial linefishery (Donovan 2010). This species is also taken by spearfishers that dive on deep reefs below 20 m depth (B. Mann, ORI pers. obs.).&#160;<br/></p>",Marine,"<p>The current fisheries regulations for <em>Chrysoblephus cristiceps</em> include a daily bag limit of one fish per person per day for both commercial and recreational fishers and a minimum size limit of 40 cm TL (Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 2012). This species is afforded some protection&#160;in several no-take MPAs on the South African coast including De Hoop, Goukamma, Tsitsikamma, Bird Island, East London MPAs, Dwesa-Cwebe and the Pondoland MPA (World Database of Protected Areas, accessed March 2014). The Tsitsikamma National Park has been shown to protect a higher abundance and a larger mean size of <em>C. cristiceps</em> than adjacent exploited areas (Buxton and Smale 1989; Buxton 1992, 1993). The De Hoop Marine Reserve and MPAs off East London probably also assist in protecting a portion of the <em>C. cristiceps</em> stock (Griffiths and Wilke 2002; M. Smale, PEM, pers. comm.). SBPR in an unexploited MPA was estimated to be ~54% while in an exploited area SBPR was estimated at ~5% (Buxton 1993) which indicates that MPAs can be effective tools in the protection of this species.</p>","",,false,false,Global
1293194,170206,Polysteganus undulosus,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2014,2009-12-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The seventy-four seabream (<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>) is endemic to southern Africa, inhabits deep offshore reefs, and exhibits slow growth and late maturation. This species was once heavily exploited throughout its range, and particularly where it formed spawning aggregations, leading to the contraction of its distribution and the collapse of the stock in the 1960s. Individuals of this species have not been recently reported&#160;north of Sodwana Bay and south of Cape Agulhas. Although the stock had collapsed by the 1960s, strict fishery regulations were not implemented until 1985, and were subsequently revised in 1992 with no evidence of stock recovery. This led to the implementation of a ten year catch moratorium for&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;in 1998. In 2007, an assessment was conducted on <em>P. undulosus</em> which showed limited recovery of the adult stock but increasing numbers of juveniles in their traditional nursery areas in the Eastern Cape. This work led to the moratorium being extended for a further five years. In addition to the moratorium, several no-take MPAs are likely to aid in the recovery of this stock, particularly the Pondoland Marine Protected Area (MPA) established in 2004. Despite this species' occurrence in no-take MPAs and the moratorium, <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;is still subject to illegal fishing, as a result of high prices on the black market, which poses a major threat to the recovery of this species.&#160;Catches declined&#160;substantially&#160;from over 1,000 tonnes in the early 1900s to less than 400 tonnes in the 1920s and 1930s and by the 1980s only 5.4 tonnes were reported.&#160;CPUE for&#160;<em>P. undulosus </em>thus&#160;declined by ~99% and SBPR is currently estimated at &lt;5%.&#160;The moratorium was extended to 2013 and the status of the stock needs to be re-evaluated.&#160;Based on population declines of &gt;90% extrapolated over three generation lengths (=39 years)&#160;this species is listed as Critically Endangered under A2bcd.&#160;However, juveniles of this species have become increasingly abundant in the Border area of the Eastern Cape (Kei Mouth to East London) to the extent that fishermen are reporting not being able to catch other reef fish species due to the prevalence of <em>P. undulosus</em>. This suggests that the moratorium and MPAs are working and at least that population is recovering.","<em>Polysteganus undulosus </em>adults are found offshore, over deep-water reefs and pinnacles forming dense shoals in depths down to 160 m (Ahrens 1964, van der Elst 1993, Garratt 1996). Juveniles are fairly resident and inhabit offshore reefs deeper than 20 m in the Eastern and Western Cape (Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1989, Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI) Tagging Project unpublished data).&#160;<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;is primarily a piscivore, feeding on pelagic species such as sardines and mackerel (e.g.,&#160;<em>Sardinops sagax</em> and <em>Scomber japonicus</em>)&#160;as well as small reef fish, cephalopods and crustaceans (Garratt 1996, Mann and Fennessy 2013). Juveniles of this species feed primarily on mysids and other invertebrates (Pillay 2011).<br/><br/>Adults undertake an annual, spawning migration from Cape waters to the former Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal during the winter (Ahrens 1964, Garratt 1988, Garratt 1996). A return migration of the adults to Cape waters has not been confirmed (Ahrens 1964, Mann and Fennessy 2013). This annual migration may also be in response to the seasonal migration of&#160;<em>Sardinops sagax </em>into KwaZulu-Natal waters (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;The growth rate between males and females is similar&#160;and age estimates range to&#160;20 or more years&#160;for <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;(Chale-Matsau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). However, this species may exceed 20 years in age as the largest fish sampled in the former study was only 11 kg (Mann 2007). The maximum recorded size of this species is 16 kg weight and 100 cm TL (IGFA 2012, van der Elst 1993, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><br/><em>Polysteganus undulosus </em>is a rudimentary hermaphrodite and functional&#160;gonochorist (Ahrens 1964, Chale-Matsau 1996, Mann 2007, Buxton and Garratt 1990). <em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;reaches 50% maturity at about 8.8 years of age for both sexes (Chale-Matsau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001), with first maturity evident from four to five years (Mann and Fennessy 2013). Length at 50% maturity for this species is attained from 65 cm to 75 cm (Chale-Matsau 1996).&#160;Spawning occurs from late winter to spring from July to November with peak spawning occurring from August to October when adults form predictable spawning aggregations (Ahrens 1964, Penney <em>et al</em>. 1989, Mann 2007). Spawning takes place on offshore reefs from 50 m to 100 m depth off the KwaZulu-Natal southern coast and northern Transkei coast (Ahrens 1964, Garratt 1988, Mann 2007). Spawning was previously also known to occur on deep reefs off Umvoti mouth on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast (B. Clark commercial fisherman pers. comm.). The Illovo Banks south of Amanzimtoti on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal was a well-known spawning aggregation site (Ahrens 1964, Penney<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>1989, Garratt 1988, Penney <em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Mann 2007); however, since the depletion of the stock there has been little evidence of recovery at this locality (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;Fecundity of females ranges from one to three million eggs (Ahrens 1964).&#160;The pelagic eggs of&#160;<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;are assumed to be carried southwards inshore of the Agulhas Current (Penney <em>et al.&#160;</em>1989) but have not been recorded off Park Rynie on the southern coast of KwaZulu-Natal after 25 years of sampling (A. Connell, South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity pers. comm.).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;is estimated to be 13 years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>","<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em> was overexploited and fished down to very low levels throughout the 20th&#160;century&#160;(Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Griffiths 2000).&#160;During the peak spawning season (August to October),&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;historically formed predictable spawning aggregations in areas such as the Illovo Banks south of Durban which were heavily targeted by line fishermen (Penney&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). This resulted in recruitment overfishing and severe depletion of the stock. The range of&#160;<em>P. undulosus </em>has contracted and at the time of last assessment (2007) limited evidence of recovery of the adult stock was available (Mann 2007, Mann and Fennessy 2013). In addition to forming a predictable spawning aggregations,&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em> exhibits intrinsic characteristics including slow growth and late maturation (Chale-Matsua <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Mann 2007) that slow stock recovery and make this species more vulnerable to additional exploitation by illegal fishing practices and incidental catches (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;<em>Polysteganus undulosus </em>does not reach sexual maturity until about eight years of age and long-lived, late maturing species are generally more susceptible to overexploitation, even at low levels of fishing (Acosta and Appeldoorn 1992). <em>Polysteganus undulosus </em>is&#160;an iconic species and a popular food fish and despite the moratorium, illegal and unreported harvesting of this species for human food has continued (B. Mann and C. Buxton pers. comm. 2009) which could impede the recovery of the stock.<br/><br/>	The removal of large sparid fish can change the community structure, reduce both primary and secondary production in a temperate-reef ecosystem (Babcock <em>et al.</em> 1999) and can reduce the links of reef ecosystems with the pelagic food web. Virtually all South African warm/temperate, bottom-dwelling, subtidal linefish species have been overexploited which can result in the loss of productivity, commensurate socio-economic impact and a high risk of commercial extinction with harmful impacts to trophic flow and biodiversity likely (Griffiths 2000).","The historic distributional range of&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;has decreased in size with no fish recently reported north of Sodwana Bay and south of Cape Agulhas (Mann 2007).&#160;Prior to the closure of the fishery in 1998 the&#160;spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR)&#160;was believed to have been &lt;5% of its pristine level (A. Govender pers. comm. in Chale-Matsau 1996). <em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;has thus been considered commercially extinct since before the fishery closed in 1998 (Chale-Matsau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Moloney&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;During the 20th&#160;century, catches and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of adult <em>P. undulosus</em> declined off KwaZulu-Natal by more than 90% (Garratt 1996, Penney <em>et al</em>. 1999) while catches in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces also declined by more than 90% (Griffiths 2000). Stocks &lt;25% of the pristine status are indicative of stock depletion in long-lived species and are at high risk of collapse (Clark 1991, Mace and Sissenwine 1993, Thompson 1993, Mace 1994). Reductions in CPUE of &gt;90% coincide with spawner biomass ratios of &lt;10% and are indicative of severe stock depletion (Griffiths 2000).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;is currently closed to commercial and recreational fisheries due to the overexploited status of the stock (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, South Africa 2012).&#160;This species was heavily targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout the 20th century. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was revealed to be &lt;1% than that of historical values based on commercial and fishery-independent survey data, while more recent stock assessments show a decline in CPUE of 99% (Griffiths 2000).&#160;<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;was initially targeted by harbour-based lineboats and then later by smaller, shore-launched skiboats, especially on their spawning grounds in KwaZulu-Natal, south of Durban. Initially, large adult fish comprised the bulk of the catch taken by this fishery but by the late 1960s catches in KwaZulu-Natal had collapsed and only small quantities of this species continued to be caught in the Eastern Cape (van der Elst and Garratt 1984, Penney&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Mann 2007). Line catches from the Southeastern and Southern Cape also declined considerably during the 20th&#160;century (Griffiths 2000). A retrospective stock assessment&#160;conducted in 1996 (based on data collected during 1962–1963 by Ahrens (1964)) revealed that the stock had collapsed in the 1960s (Griffiths 2000, Chale-Matsau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). The decline of CPUE by more than 90% throughout its distribution triggered the implementation of a moratorium in 1998 to allow the stock to recover (Mann and Fennessy 2013). &#160;<p>In 1910,&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;comprised 70% of the KwaZulu-Natal commercial linefish catch with 1,550 tonnes landed and from 1921 to 1933 catch composition of this species ranged from 30% to 50% with 337 tonnes caught.&#160;By the late 1950s the annual catch of&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;had halved despite a dramatic increase in fishing effort (van der Elst and Garratt 1984, Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).&#160;By 1985, only 5.4 tonnes were reported by the commercial line fishery, comprising &lt; 1% of the total commercial linefish catch in KwaZulu-Natal (Penny&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989, Birnie<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>1994, Chale-Matsau 1996, Penney&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). By 1997, the last year that the fishery for&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;was still open, the total reported catch of&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;by the commercial line fishery throughout South Africa was only 2.6 tonnes with a mere 1.4 tonnes reported from KwaZulu-Natal, representing a dramatic collapse (NMLS, unpublished data; Mann 2007). A similar collapse in&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;catches was reported for Cape waters (Griffiths 2000).&#160;For example, the average catch per boat year dropped to 0.09% in the Southwestern Cape, 0.01% &#160;in the Southern Cape and 0.22% in the Southeastern Cape of historical values (Griffiths 2000). Average catch per boat year was: 40 kg (1897-1906), 28 kg (1927-1931), and 0.04 kg (1986-1998) in the Southwestern Cape; 580 kg (1897-1906), 200 kg (1927-1931), and 0.07 kg (1986-1998) in the Southern Cape; and 5,944 kg (1897-1906), 339 kg (1927-1931), and 13 kg (1986-1998) in the Southeastern Cape (Griffiths 2000).</p><p>Since the implementation of the moratorium on catching&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;in 1998, poaching still occurs driven by high prices on the black market (Mann 2007).&#160;A reassessment of&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;conducted in 2007 showed a slight increase in the mean size of adult fish but little evidence of recovery of the adult spawning population in southern KwaZulu-Natal. However, juveniles of this species have become increasingly abundant in the Border area of the Eastern Cape (Kei Mouth to East London) to the extent that fishermen are reporting not being able to catch other reef fish species due to the prevalence of <em>P. undulosus</em>. This suggests that the moratorium and the MPAs proclaimed in the area are working and that the population is now showing signs of recovery (B. Mann pers. comm.)</p>",Increasing,"<em>Polysteganus undulosus </em>is endemic to the southeastern coast of southern Africa from Cape Point, Western Cape to the mouth of the Limpopo River in southern Mozambique (Ahrens 1964, Smith and Heemstra 1991, van der Elst 1988, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004, Garratt 1996). The depth range for this species is 40 m to 160 m (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;The overexploitation of&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;has resulted in a range contraction from its historical distribution&#160;with no specimens recently reported north of Sodwana Bay and south of Cape Agulhas (Mann 2007).&#160;The centre of the adult distribution is currently deep offshore reefs between Durban and East London (Mann 2007).","<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;is currently closed to commercial and recreational fishing due to the severely overexploited status of the stock (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, South Africa 2012).&#160;This species was heavily targeted by commercial and recreational line-fisheries throughout the 20th Century (Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Griffiths 2000).",Marine,"<em>Polysteganus undulosus</em>&#160;is currently closed to commercial and recreational fishing due to the severely overexploited status of the stock (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The first conservation actions for <em>P. undulosus&#160;</em>were implemented in South African legislation in 1984 and included a minimum size limit of 25 cm TL, a bag limit of five fish per person per day (pppd) and a closed season during the spawning season from the 1st of September to the 30th of November (Garratt 1988,&#160;regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 58 of 1973). Amendments were made to this legislation in 1992 including an increased minimum size limit to 40 cm TL and a reduced daily bag limit to two fish pppd (Chale-Matsau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001,&#160;regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 12 of 1988). Following research conducted by Chale-Matsua <em>et al. </em>(2001) in 1996 and no further improvement in catches, a 10-year moratorium was implemented for <em>P. undulosus</em> in South Africa in 1998 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012). From 2006 to 2007 a reassessment of the <em>P. undulosus</em> stock was conducted on the KwaZulu-Natal coast (Mann 2007). Little evidence was found of increased catch per unit effort off the KwaZulu-Natal coast although there was some evidence of increased abundance of juvenile fish in the Eastern Cape. Based on this research, the then responsible South African government department (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism) extended the moratorium until 2013 where after, the stock status should be re-evaluated. In addition to traditional fisheries management, a number of large no-take MPAs have been established along the South African coast. One of the most recent MPAs to be established was the Pondoland MPA between Port Edward and Port St Johns and extending out to the 1,000 m depth contour (Mann<em> et al.</em> 2006). It is likely that the Dwesa-Cwebe, Amathole and Bird Island MPAs currently play an important role in providing protection for juvenile <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;which appear to be fairly resident (B. Mann, ORI pers. obs.), while the Pondoland MPA may play a role in protection of adults (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2006). There has been little evidence of&#160;<em>P. undulosus&#160;</em>receiving protection in MPAs further south (i.e. Tsitsikamma, Goukamma, Stilbaai and De Hoop) (Mann and Fennessy 2013).&#160;<p>The slow recovery of the <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;stock is not surprising given its slow growth and late age at maturity. It may be that its niche has been filled by other reef fishes, although this has not been investigated. Due to its rarity and high price on the black market, poaching of <em>P. undulosus</em> has continued despite the implementation of the moratorium (Mann 2007). Mann (2007) recommended that the moratorium should remain in place for a further 10 years, until end of 2017, before consideration is given to reopening the fishery. Consideration should also be given to extending the Aliwal Shoal MPA northwards to include some of the historical spawning grounds on the Illovo Banks and focus on protecting the deep reefs in this area, particularly between August and November (Mann 2007). Monitoring the status of a fish species which has been closed to fishing is difficult as all fishery-dependent data are excluded. Fishery-independent and non-invasive methods, such as underwater videography, should be used to monitor <em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;populations. There is also a need for additional information about the movement patterns and the distribution of eggs and larvae (Mann and Fennessy 2013). Fishing mortality is also incurred when&#160;<em>P. undulosus</em>&#160;are accidentally hooked and brought to the surface in the process of which severe barotrauma occurs (Mann and Fennessy 2013). Nevertheless, it is believed that overall fishing mortality has been greatly reduced for this species since the implementation of the moratorium and the increased public awareness about the critical status of this stock.&#160;The abundance of juvenile <em>P. undulosus</em> in the Border area of the Eastern Cape bodes well for the eventual recovery of this population and careful consideration will need to be given to how this species is managed in future should the moratorium be lifted.&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

This species is a popular food fish in Japan, and is among the top four Fugu species consumed in Japan.&#160;Declines in landing statistics reported from the Sekai National Fisheries Institute in Nagasaki and  the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City indicate localized population declines  of 99.99% over the last 40 years, with steady declines from a peak of 3,600 tonnes in 1969 to about one tonne in 2008. Elsewhere, declines in wild populations in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea have been noted, but remain to be quantified. <em>Takifugu chinensis</em> is threatened by overfishing resulting from fisheries mismanagement, as well as pollution, urban development and possibly the effects of wide-spread aquaculture of the closely-related congener<em> T. rubripes. </em>The escape or intentional release of aquacultured<em> T. rubripes&#160;</em>threatens the genetic integrity of this species through possible introgression and hybridization, and large-scale aquaculture operations with high mortality rates may introduce pathogens to wild populations. This species is harvested by bottom long-line fishing, which is very efficient in the capture of this and other <em>Takifugu</em> species. Additionally, cultured individuals listed under the name <em>T. chinensi</em>s may be mis-identified and pertain to <em>T. rubripes </em>and <em>T. pseudommus.</em> Taxonomy of cultured species remains to be verified.&#160;There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place, however this species may benefit from management directed towards&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;under plans such as the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources, implemented in Japan in 2005, which includes seasonal closures, improvements to fishing grounds, support for some stock assessment programs (for other species of pufferfish), and the mandated release of small fishes.&#160;There is no evidence that catches have increased above the 2008 level in recent years. Therefore, we list this species as Critically Endangered under criterion A2bd. We accept current taxonomy that this species is valid (Eschmeyer 2011) and although taxonomic problems persist for this putative species, it is clear that even at the population level there have been severe population declines. Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu </em>genus, and the  prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend  further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological  methods. <em>Takifugu chinensis</em> also occurs in several marine protected areas throughout its distribution. There is very little information available on the population status, life history characteristics, habitat and ecology of this species. We recommend continued research on this species' life history characteristics and population status.","<p><em>Takifugu chinensis</em> inhabits the continental shelf and sandy bottoms, and is usually found at depths of 50 to 100 metres (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Although it has been recorded in lakes and rivers, neither this species nor <em>T. rubripes</em> are found in these habitats (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). It spawns at depths of 80 metres over sandy, muddy bottoms on the continental shelf (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2007).The age of first maturity has been estimated at two to three years (Yu 2003,&#160;K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011). Longevity is estimated at nine years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2011).&#160;Based on this information, generation length has been estimated to be four years.

They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

This estimate is based  on landing statistics from the East China Sea and Yellow Sea provided by  the Sekai National Fisheries Institute in Nagasaki and the National  Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City.&#160;</p><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. chinensis</em> are not well understood, over-exploitation was the principal cause of population decline in several congeners, including the closely related <em>T. rubripes</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). As culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","<strong>Population structure<br/></strong>Molecular analyses of the whole mitochondrial genome of the genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;revealed that the genetic differences between&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. pseudommus</em>,&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>basilevskiannus</em>, and&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;are not significantly different from the genetic differences between individuals within the species&#160;<em>T.&#160;</em><em>chinensis</em>, reinforcing the need for further taxonomic studies of the genus using molecular and morphological techniques (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<em>&#160;</em>Additionally,<em>&#160;</em><em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. pseudommus&#160;</em>were previously proposed to belong to the same species as&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;based on analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (Song&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Reza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;<span class=""nbApiHighlight"">Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967, Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

These include:&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>,&#160;<em>T. porphyreus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>T. xanthopterus. </em>Catch records of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>in on the west coast of Kyushu Island, Japan&#160;have shown a sharp drop from 3600 tonnes/year in 1969, to 2300 tonnes/year in 1972, to 1600 tonnes per year in 1975, to 1000 tonnes/year in 1979, to 200 tonnes/year in 1989, and 100 tonnes in 1999 (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007). More recent records from the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City (the city being famous for its specialized pufferfish-only market),&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;was regularly found in the Fugu fish market in the 1960s at a level of 3000 tonnes, however the figure dropped sharply in the late 1970s through the 1990s. Only one tonne was recorded in 2006 and 2008&#160;(Matsuura pers. comm. 2010).&#160;Based on the above landing statistics, it is estimated that the global population of&#160;<em>T. chinensis</em>&#160;may have declined by over 99.99% over the last 40 years. Over the course of three generation lengths, or 12 years, this species may have declined by as much as 99%. This estimate is based on landing statistics of harvests from the East China Sea and Yellow Sea provided by the Sekai National Fisheries Institute in Nagasaki and the National Fisheries University in Shimonoseki City. It is also worth noting that&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>, one of the most expensive commercial fish species in Japan which is a genetically close relative of&#160;<em>T. chinensis&#160;</em>has also experienced population declines in the region which have been attributed to fisheries mismanagement and overfishing. Despite increasing fishing effort in the region, the wild catch of <em>T. rubripes </em>fell to less than 500 tonnes in 1994, and has continued to decrease ever since (Reza <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p><em>Takifugu chinensis </em>is uncommon in museum collections, it is represented by eight lots (FishNet2 database searched November 2013).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span> is found in the Northwest Pacific, from Northern Kyushu, Japan west to the East China and Yellow seas (Nakabo 2002).&#160;It is found at depths ranging from 5 to 150 metres.","<p><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis </span>is a highly-desirable, commercially important species.

Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7800 to 11000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks 5th among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high mortality—survival is estimated to be less than 50%—from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong></p>  <p></p>",Marine,"There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Takifugu chinensis</span>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. chinensis</em>.<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/>The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p><p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p><p><strong>Further research</strong><br/>The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

2876505,3854,Carcharias taurus,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2021,2020-12-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Sand Tiger Shark (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>) is a large (to 325 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution. It is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf at depths of 0–232 m, however it mainly occurs in shallow waters of 15–25 m depth. It has very low biological productivity, with litter sizes of just 2 pups, which greatly reduces its ability to withstand fishing pressure. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, recreational, and industrial fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including longline, gillnet, and trawl, and is mostly retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal a subpopulation reduction of &gt;80% in east Australia, with inferred subpopulation reductions of 30–49% in Northwest Atlantic and South Africa over the past three generation lengths (74 years). The species is suspected to be Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic, Mediterranean, and the Arabian Seas region where it is either no longer or rarely encountered. It is suspected to have undergone similar levels of reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (74 years) in West Africa and Southeast Asia where there are high levels of historic and current inshore fishing pressure. Overall, the species is estimated and suspected to be declining across its entire range due to exploitation, except for west Australia, with signs of the onset of recovery evident where management measures have prohibited retention or reduced fishing mortality and have been in place for some time, that is in the Northwest Atlantic, South Africa, and east Australia. Globally, it is suspected that the Sand Tiger Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations lengths (74 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>","The Sand Tiger Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf from the surf zone to a depth of 232 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It occurs mainly in shallow waters of 15–25 m depth and aggregates in or near underwater caves, gullies, and rocky and coral reefs (Otway and Parker 2000, Pollard <em>et al</em>. 1996, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Momigliano and Jaiteh 2015). The species is philopatric and undertakes complex size- and sex-segregated migrations associated with seasonal and reproductive events, habitually returning to the same breeding area (Bass <em>et al</em>. 1975, Gilmore 1993, Musick <em>et al</em>. 1993, Otway and Ellis 2011, Bansemer and Bennett 2011). It reaches a maximum size of 325 cm total length (TL), males mature at 190–200 cm TL and females mature at 220–235 cm TL (Gilmore <em>et al</em>. 1993, Lucifora 2003, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is adelphophagic viviparous with a litter size of 2 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle (possibly annual and triennial regionally), and a size-at-birth of 85–105 cm TL (Branstetter and Musick 1994, Henningsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gilmore <em>et al</em>. 2005, Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bansemer and Bennett 2009). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 7.7 years in the Southwest Atlantic and 9–10 years in the Northwest Atlantic and maximum age is validated to at least 40 years in the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Indian Oceans (Lucifora 2003, Passerotti et al. 2014, Jakobs and Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2019, S. Wintner pers. comm. 13 March 2020). Generation length is thus estimated as 24.8 years.","The Sand Tiger Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, recreational, and industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including longline, line, gillnet, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is also a bycatch of beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Australia, during the 1960s and 1970s this species was actively persecuted and killed off New South Wales by spear fishers (Reid and Krogh 1992). At-vessel mortality has been reported as zero for demersal longlines and when released from both longlines and rod-and-reel, the species has high survival rates (Carslon <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kneebone <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017, Kilfoil <em>et al</em>. 2017). In South Africa, this species is captured in the recreational shore angling fishery (Smale 2002, Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2006). Tag recapture data has shown that pregnant sharks are philopatric to their gestation areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal, within the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area (Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2007). Concern had been expressed that the increase in tourist SCUBA divers over the past 10 years may be impacting the number of Sand Tiger Sharks seen in the iSimangaliso MPA. However, a recent study from 2019 to 2020 suggests that this may not be the case (Staiger 2020).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged industrial fisheries in many areas. In Brazil, large aggregations of the Sand Tiger Shark were targeted and eradicated in Santa Catarina state by spear fishermen in the 1970s and 1980s (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the Mediterranean, unmanaged spear fishing and unregulated coastal fisheries may have caused the acute decline of the Sand Tiger Shark (Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2000). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years. For e.g, effective fishing effort of the small-scale fleet operating off Mauritania is estimated to have increased by a factor of 10 during the past 25 years (Gascuel 2007). In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the species' inshore habitats. For e.g., In Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing for aquaculture and development, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019). Conversely, climate change is predicted to create additional available habitat for the species in some areas, which may contribute to recovery and resilience of the species (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><p></p>  <p></p>","Genetic studies support at least five subpopulations of the Sand Tiger Shark where it has been sampled, that is, Northwest Atlantic, Japan, west Australia, east Australia, and South Africa which is possibly also the same subpopulation as Brazil and the Mediterranean Sea (Stow <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ahonen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Fioravanti <em>et al</em>. 2019). Genetic data imply a low frequency of migration among each of these five regions and that the populations are genetically discrete (Ahonen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Fioravanti <em>et al</em>. 2019). Population trend data were available from three sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2009, J. Carlson and C. McCandless unpubl. data 2020); (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020); and, (3) east Australia (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) based on fisheries independent longline surveys and commercial observer data from the United States shark bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1975–2006 indicated low to moderate declines in abundance over that period, although the first 15 years of data, i.e., from 1975 to 1990 are based on very low sample size and missing years of data for one of the data sets which led to high levels of uncertainty (Carlson et al. 2009). The catches fluctuated but generally decreased from 1975 until the early 1990s after which they remained low (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The data post-1990 are considered more robust (SEDAR 2020) and were used in the trend analysis along with updated CPUE data to 2019. The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1990–2019 (30 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.3%, consistent with a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (74 years). However, experts do not consider this analysis accurately represents the trend as there has been an historical decline in Sand Tiger Shark in the Northwest Atlantic, but the lack of robust data makes it difficult to quantify that level of decline. An Ecological Risk Assessment of the Sand Tiger Shark in the Atlantic found it to be ranked as one of the less vulnerable Atlantic shark species as it has low susceptibility to longline fisheries due to a combination of limited overlap with fisheries and high post-capture survival rates when released from longlines (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2008). Based on suspected low to moderate historic declines, limited overlap with fisheries, no evidence of growth overfishing (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2009), but a low productivity that slows recovery rates, expert judgement elicitation inferred a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (74 years).<br/><br/>Second, the standardized CPUE from the Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) bather protection program (South Africa) for 1981–2019 initially rose then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years. This increase may be a reflection of the management changes in the bather protection program which has seen a reduction in effort in order to reduce captures of species. The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed an annual rate of reduction of 1.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 61% over three generation lengths (74 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the population structure and seasonal movement patterns of the Sand Tiger Shark. It is possible that catch trends reflect the removal of individuals philopatric to the netted beaches rather than the level of decline along the entire South African coast. Recreational shore angling catch rates for Sand Tiger Shark in the Eastern Cape of South Africa have increased between 1989–2004 (Pradervand and Govender 2003, Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2012), indicating a stable population over at least 16 years. This recent stable population is supported by both mark-recapture (Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2008) and recent multilocus genotype population assessments (Klein et al. 2020). Based on localised declines in the KZNSB bather protection program and a stable population elsewhere in South Africa for at least 16 years, expert judgement elicitation inferred a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (74 years).<br/><br/>Third, the nominal CPUE from the east coast New South Wales bather protection program for 1950–2009 revealed a dramatic catch decline for the first three decades, when the species was heavily targeted by fishers, and very low subsequent catches (Reid et al. 2011). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1950–2009 (60 years) revealed an annual rate of reduction of 5.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 97.8% over three generation lengths (74 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. The east coast subpopulation is considered Critically Endangered (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2003a). More recently, close-kin mark recapture estimated current adult population sizes of the east coast subpopulation of 1,686–2,167 with the range attributed to differing age-at-maturity estimates (Bradford et al. 2018). An increasing population trend for this subpopulation was estimated with annual rates of increase of 3.4–4.5%, which indicates there has been some recovery of the subpopulation, likely as a result of a voluntary and legislated prohibitions on capture from 1979 onward (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Additionally, the west Australia subpopulation was considered stable when captured prior to its protection in 1997 (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Although there has been no reporting of the catches post-protection, fishing effort is the main source of mortality for this species. The Western Australian demersal gillnet fishery has been stable, and the fishery closed in the area around Perth, thus, it is unlikely that there has been any increase in catches. The west coast subpopulation is considered Near Threatened (Pollard <em>et al</em>. 2003b).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, CPUE for this species declined dramatically in southern Brazil by 97% from 1980 to 1990 (Soto 2001). In Rio Grande de Sul, this species was fished with gillnets and was abundant in the 1980s, however by 2005 there were no records from the shore-based fishery, and it occurred in only 3 of 43 monitored gillnet fishery trips, and is now considered rare in the area (Vooren <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Uruguay, this species had been caught since the 1950s by the artisanal fishery, but catches declined by 96% from 1985 to 2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The species is considered Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean, the last known record of the Sand Tiger Shark was of an individual captured in 2008 and with no records since, it is suspected that there are less than 250 mature individuals remaining in the Mediterranean and that the species is considered Critically Endangered and locally Possibly Extinct (Walls and Soldo 2016, Bargnesi <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no confirmed records from the Red Sea in several decades, and in the Gulf, this species is now only seen occasionally as single individuals in Kuwait and Qatar, Iraq, and United Arab Emirates (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2007, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ali 2013, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2013). In India, it is now rarely encountered and has not been recorded from landings surveys over the past decade (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 9 February 2017). The species has been previously confirmed from Sri Lanka, but not recently recorded (Móron et al. 1998, D. Fernando pers. comm. 9 February 2017). It is suspected to be Critically Endangered in the Arabian Seas region (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The Sand Tiger Shark is estimated and suspected to be declining across its entire range due to exploitation, except for west Australia, with signs of the onset of recovery where management measures have been in place for some time which prohibit retention or reduced fishing mortality, that is, in the Northwest Atlantic, South Africa, and east Australia. The east Australian subpopulation is estimated to have undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (74 years), while the Northwest Atlantic and South African subpopulations are inferred to have undergone reductions of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (74 years). The species is suspected to be Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic, Mediterranean, and the Arabian Seas region, that is, reductions of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (74 years). Elsewhere, in Southeast Asia and West Africa, fishing pressure is high across the spatial and depth range of this species, and it is suspected similar levels of dramatic decline have occurred. Overall, it is suspected that the Sand Tiger Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (74 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Sand Tiger Shark has a circumglobal distribution. It occurs in all oceans except for the eastern Pacific (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, SEAFDEC 2016, NFRDI 2017, White <em>et al</em>. 2017, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, Tyabji <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The species is used for it meat that is consumed fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried and salted. It is used for its fins which accounted for &lt;1% of fin samples analysed in Hong Kong (Fields <em>et al</em>. 2018), and for its skin, liver oil, and for fish meal. It is popular in public aquaria and for dive tourism in the United States of America, South Africa, and Australia (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,"Species-specific measures are in place in a number of countries and regions. In the United States (US), it was listed as a prohibited species in 1997 under the Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic Sharks (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Australia, game fishers voluntarily banned capture of this species in Australian waters in 1979, it was protected in 1984 in New South Wales, and in 1997 it was listed as threatened under the national Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act in 1997, making the take and retention of this species illegal throughout its Australian range. A National Recovery Plan for the species was adopted in 2002 and updated in 2014. From 2001 to 2009, 26 Marine Protected Areas were established in east Australia, at least in part, to manage interactions with the Sand Tiger Shark (Lynch <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Argentina, the landing of this species is prohibited in recreational fisheries. In the Mediterranean, Parties to the Barcelona Convention agreed that the Sand Tiger Shark is prohibited to be retained and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible. In South Africa, it was protected from commercial fishing through the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998, as a precautionary approach in response to declining population trends elsewhere in the world. In recent years, fishing effort by the Kwazulu-Natal bather protection program has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global
2899669,39331,Squatina occulta,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Hidden Angelshark (<em>Squatina occulta</em>) is a medium-sized shark (to 160 cm total length) endemic to the Southwest Atlantic inhabiting waters from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Buenos Aires Province, Argentina and likely further south to the northern Patagonia-Argentine region. It is mainly found on the continental shelf at depths of 10-150 m, but has been found at depths to 350 m. The species' low reproductive potential (litter size of 4-10 and a possible three-to-five-year female breeding cycle) together with its susceptibility to capture in both trawl and gillnet gear makes it highly susceptible to population depletion. Angel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and significant reductions have been documented there.&#160;In the period from 1988 to 2002, on the continental shelf of southern Brazil, the abundance of <em>Squatina</em> species was reduced by approximately 85%, and benthic trawl fishing continued to intensively exploit this population in more recent years.               In the same region, scientific fishing cruises conducted between 1986 to 2001 using bottom trawls revealed that the frequency of occurrence and CPUE (in kg/hour and number of individuals/hour) of this species was reduced by 80% confirming trends observed in commercial fisheries. In Argentina, trawl catches of <em>Squatina</em> underwent a reduction of 58% in the years 1992-1998, showing a continuing negative trend since then. These are the equivalent of a &gt;99% reduction over three generation lengths (46.5 years), however there may be other areas within its range where fishing intensity is not as high. The catch and trade of this species has been banned in Brazil since 2004, but it is still targeted illegally and caught as bycatch and sold in markets. Given the species' relatively low productivity, the presence of intensive fisheries throughout the species' range, and the level of localized reductions reported, the Hidden Angelshark is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of over 80% over three generation lengths (46.5 years) across its range, and is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Hidden Angelshark is a medium-sized (to 160 cm total length; TL) demersal shark (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species occurs at depths of 10-350 m; it is found most commonly throughout the year from 50 to 100 m from the mid- and outer continental shelf, and is scarce at depths of 10 to 20 m and from 100 to 350 m (Vooren and da Silva 1991).&#160;<br/><br/>Hidden Angelsharks are lecithotrophic viviparous. Males mature at 82 cm TL and females at 89 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The breeding cycle of the females lasts at least two years. The gestation period is approximately 11 months, and young are born in spring. The breeding cycle of the female may take 4-5 years, with variation between individuals (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Uterine fecundity ranges from 4 to 10, with an average of 7 embryos, and the size at birth is 30 cm TL. Birth occurs in summer months, usually at depths of 60 to 80 m (Vooren and Klippel 2005). 100% sexual maturity occurs from the age of 10 years and the longevity is at least 21 years (Vooren and Klippel 2005). According to available data on longevity, reproductive ages and duration of the reproductive cycle, females may produce a maximum of five litters throughout an individual's reproductive life. <span style="""">This species </span>has a calculated generation length of 15.5 years. Similar to other <em>Squatina</em> species, the Hidden Angelshark carries out its entire life cycle on the shelf, with no seasonal migrations between depths or regions reported. However, females may move to shallower (60-80 m) coastal waters to give birth (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<span style=""""><br/></span>","The major threats to populations of Hidden Angelshark are bottom trawls and bottom-set gillnets. <br/><br/>Until 1989, bottom trawl gears targeting demersal fish mainly caught <em>Squatina</em> species in Brazil. Although this type of fishing gear continues to operate, from 1990 the introduction of bottom gillnets increased on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil, leading to an increase in the capture of angel shark species. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005). This efficiency is due to two factors: first, the nocturnal behavior of the species determines the high vulnerability to night fishing with bottom gillnets; secondly, this fleet practices directed fishing of angel sharks with stretched mesh of 35 to 40 cm between opposing nodes. For these reasons, fishing with gillnets is the main threat to the remaining populations of <em>Squatina</em> species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Although angel sharks were heavily targeted by these nets in the early 2000s, depletion has led them to be caught more infrequently and the targeted fishery is no longer profitable (Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). Currently, the Itajaí fleet (Santa Catarina, Brazil) is responsible for most of the fishing effort on the South Platform. In 2007, in the port of Itajaí, 61% of the <em>Squatina</em> catches came from the bottom gillnet fleet, and 39% from bottom trawling. These two fishing modalities are the main extrinsic factors that affect the population of this species in Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>Gravid females have been observed to abort embryos easily upon capture, further reducing the reproductive capacity (Vooren and Klippel 2005). A low rate of dispersal between populations also makes them especially prone to local depletion and means that recolonization will be extremely low. <br/><br/>In Uruguay, there is little direct fishing for  angel sharks, but they are taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal  fisheries (Paesch and Domingo 2003).<br/>In Argentina, Chiaramonte (1998) stated that <em>Squatina</em> species were the second most important fish landed by the gillnet fleet of Puerto Quequen (Buenos Aires Province), however this was mostly the Angular Angelshark.","Angel sharks in the Southwest Atlantic are notoriously difficult to distinguish and catches and landings are typically reported at the genus level. Unless otherwise stated the information below refers to the genus as a whole (i.e. combined catch or landings of all <em>Squatina </em>species that are native to the region). <br/><strong></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil</strong><br/>In the period from 1988 to 2002, on the continental shelf of Rio Grande do Sul, the abundance of <em>Squatina</em> species was reduced by approximately 85%, and bottom trawling continued to intensively exploit this population in the early 2000s (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005). In São Paulo State, the gillnet fleet began directed fishing on <em>Squatina</em> species in 1997, collapsing during the year 2005 (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Angel shark stocks remain depleted as a result of ongoing incidental catch (Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the same region (continental shelf of southern Brazil), scientific  fishing cruises conducted between 1986 to 2001 using bottom trawls  reveals that the frequency of occurrence and CPUE (in kg/hour and number  of ind./hour) of this species (i.e. not aggregated <em>Squatina </em>spp.) underwent a reduction of approximately 80%, confirming trends observed in commercial  fisheries (-85% between 1988 and 2002) (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) </strong><br/>In Uruguay, angel sharks are caught by trawling on the platform and declared as “<em>angelito</em>”. Annual catches by Uruguay of Argentinian, Angular, and Hidden Angelsharks combined<em> </em>were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between 1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010 the average of angel sharks declared landings was 277 t and decreased to 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo <em>et al. </em>2015). There is no clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM 2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi <em>et al.</em> (2001) found that Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch. <br/><br/>Argentinian landings in the AUCFZ underwent a reduction of 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent to a 78% reduction over three generation lengths (CTMFM 2018).&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)</strong><br/>Total captures of angel sharks in Argentina oscillated around 1,000 MT  between 1979 and 1984 then increased to maximums of over 4,000 MT in the  1990s. In 1991 as much as 4,167 MT were taken, and 4,281 MT in 1996.  Peaks were reached in 1997 and 1998, before landings dropped in 2002 to  2,000 MT, rising again in 2003 to 3,550 MT (Massa <em>et al.</em> 2004). Thus, there has been an overall negative trend in landings during the period 1998 to 2003 (Massa <em>et al.</em> 2004). Massa and Hozbor (2003) suggested a 58% reduction in the CPUE of angel shark in the coastal bottom trawl fleet, and this trajectory has continued since (although these fisheries there are thought to catch mostly Angular Angelshark; G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2018). <br/><br/>Overall, given reported past population reductions, ongoing heavy fishing pressure across its range, and its low productivity, the Hidden Angelshark is inferred to have undergone reductions of more than 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Hidden Angelshark occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (24˚S), through Uruguay to the Puerto Quequén, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (38˚S) (Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2016). Vooren and Klippel (2005) suggested that the species might be present south to 45˚S along the northern Patagonia-Argentine region, however, this requires confirmation.","Angel sharks, including this species, are caught and retained as valuable bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries. There are both directed and indirect fisheries that catch this species in Argentina and Brazil, while there is little direct fishing of the species in Uruguay, where it is mostly caught as bycatch. Angel shark meat is sold fresh or salted and dried for local consumption. In Brazil, the meat is marketed as <em>cação-anjo</em> and is typically more valuable than other shark meat which is simply known as <em>cação</em> (P. Dolphine unpubl. data 2018). Although it has been illegal to retain angel sharks in Brazil since 2004, the meat of this species does still show up in markets (Bornatowski <em>et al. </em>2018, Almerón-Souza <em>et al.</em> 2018). Since 2000, Brazilian imports of shark meat have increased eight-fold (Dent and Clarke 2015). Furthermore, Brazil imports more than 90% of the production of <em>Squatina</em> spp. from Argentina (J.-M. Cuevas unpublished data). This indicates a growing market in Brazil and may indicate depletion of the domestic Brazilian portion of the population.",Marine,"Retention of the Hidden Angelshark has been banned in Brazil since 2004, but the species is still caught illegally. In Brazil, there is no control of the shelf angel shark fishery, and although trawling in inshore waters is prohibited in some areas for some some periods, enforcement of this regulation is difficult. Because it is listed on the Brazil National Red List, the species is among the priorities of the Brazilian Action Plan for the Conservation of Marine Elasmobranchs. The species, however, was the target of fisheries in the 1980s and 1990s and never stopped being landed in Brazil (as target and bycatch). Recent data indicates that its occurrence in both landings and markets is still frequent (Bornatowski <em>et al.</em> 2018, Alméron-Souza <em>et al. </em>2018). The species was evaluated in Brazil as over-exploited in 2004 (Ministério do Meio Ambiente 2004), Critically Endangered in 2011 (Vooren <em>et al. </em>2018), and was re-evaluated again in 2017 as Critically Endangered (not yet validated), and was fully protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the  normative instructions numbers 5 and 445.&#160; <br/><br/>In September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul  approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is  prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected  area will be increased from 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12  nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore. <br/><br/>Nursery areas of the  species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further  south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern  Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no-take protection  in the country. At the same time an assessment of the relative  composition of each species in commercial landings in each country is  needed. <br/><br/>There  is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in  the Argentine Sea and it is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common  Fishing Zone between 36° and 37° S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km<sup>2</sup>  is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and  reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello <em>et al.</em>  2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between  years and it is applied to all types of vessels using bottom net  trawling.&#160; <br/><br/>The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans  in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated  by the Binational Technical Comision (<em>Comisión Técnica Mixta del Frente Marítimo</em>). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, the angel sharks <em>Squatina </em>spp.  and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between  2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a  total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay. <br/><br/>Since 1992 there is a Maximum Permitted Catch (MPC) for angel sharks in  Argentinian waters south of the AUCFZ, which was 6,000 MT in the years 1995 to 1999 and thereafter  was reduced to 4,000 MT (Massa <em>et al.</em> 2003). However, these  MPC values are not respected: 4230 MT were taken in 2006, 4294 MT in  2007, 5214 MT in 2008, 5064 MT in 2009, 5277 MT in 2010 and 4509 MT in  2011 (Fisheries statistics published by the Undersecretariat of  Fisheries and Aquaculture of the Argentine Republic  (http://www.minagri.gob.ar/site/pesca/pesca_maritima/02-desembarques/ins).<br/>Molecular markers of <em>Squatina</em> spp. have been determined for future identification of these species in local markets (Falcão <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><p>                      </p><p>Research and monitoring of population size and landings are needed across this species’ range. <br/></p><p>Although the Argentine and Angular Angelsharks were assessed by the US National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration in 2015 (Casselberry and  Carlson 2015) and later listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act in 2017, this species was not assessed or considered for inclusion under the Act. <br/></p><p><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&#160;<br/><p><br/>    </p><p><br/></p><p>                      </p><p><br/></p>      <p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
2907336,39352,Galeorhinus galeus,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2020,2020-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Tope (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 200 cm total length) bentho-pelagic shark, widespread in temperate waters in most oceans. It is present across the <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Northeast, Eastern Central,  Southwest, and Southeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern  Indian, and across all of the Pacific, except in the Northwest Pacific. It occurs on continental shelves and upper to mid slopes from shallow inshore to well offshore to depths of 826 m, though most frequently to depths of 200 m. Genetic and tagging data support up to six separate subpopulations of Tope and while the species makes extensive movements within each of the subpopulations, there is no evidence of mixing between them. Tope has a particularly low biological productivity with a late age-at-maturity and triennial reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale demersal and pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in trawl and hook-and-line fisheries. Tope is often retained for the meat and fins but is discarded or released in some areas, in line with regional management measures. Steep subpopulation and stock reductions of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (79 years) have occurred in the Southwest Atlantic, southern Africa, and Australia. In the Northeast Atlantic, the subpopulation is estimated to have&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">undergone a reduction of 76% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). The New Zealand stock is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). In the Northeast Pacific, a dramatic decline in the subpopulation occurred in the early 1940s, with no recovery until 1997<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">–2004 when localized management led to a localized increase in abundance. The consistent steep subpopulation reductions across most of the analyzed subpopulations and stocks together with the lack of movement between the subpopulations are cause for serious concern. Management in Australia, probably aided by the immigration of large mature animals from New Zealand, appears to have stabilized that stock since 2000. The subpopulation in the Northeast Atlantic has been stable in recent years, possibly due to management measures, and there is some recovery in part of the Northeast Pacific. Release of this species is mandatory since 2011 <span class=""apple-converted-space"">off Canada<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Release is mandatory in European Union waters for line-caught Tope. The global population is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 88% with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over the last three generations (79 years) due to levels of exploitation, and Tope is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</span></span></span></p>","Tope is bentho-pelagic in temperate waters on continental and insular shelves and upper to mid slopes from shallow inshore to well offshore to depths of 826 m, though it most frequently occurs to depths of 200 m (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, Wiegmann 2016, Thorburn <em>et al. </em>2019). Some large individuals travel long oceanic distances offshore well away from the continental shelves and slopes, but they do not cross ocean basins (Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al. </em>2008, Colloca <em>et al. </em>2019). Tope sometimes moves diurnally from shallow water at night to deep water by day, and usually occurs in schools, partially segregated by size and sex (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species has pupping and nursery areas in shallow, protected bays and estuaries where the young can remain for up to two years (Stevens and West 1997, Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bovcon 2018, McMillan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The maximum size varies regionally with the largest maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) in the Mediterranean Sea (Capapé and Mellinger 1998) and the smallest maximum size of 155 cm TL in the Southwest Atlantic (Peres and Vooren 1991). There is also regional variation in size-at-maturity: males mature at 107–170 cm TL and females mature at 118–185 cm TL (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes 6–52 (average 20–35), a reproductive cycle that reportedly varies regionally from annual to triennial, although studies with intensive sampling indicate triennial cycles, and a gestation period of ~12 months and size-at-birth that varies regionally from 26–40 cm TL (Peres and Vooren 1991, Walker 1999, Walker 2005, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Female age-at-maturity varies from 10–15 years (average 12.5 years) and maximum age is estimated as 40 years (tag returns suggest a possible maximum age of 60 years); generation length is therefore 26.3 years (Olsen 1954, Ferriera and Vooren 1991, Freer 1992, Francis and Mulligan 1998, Walker 1999).<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

has a long history and ongoing capture as target and bycatch globally in industrial, small-scale, and recreational demersal and pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in trawl, hook-and-line, troll lines, trammel nets, and traps. Tope is generally retained for the meat, fins, and liver oil (Dent and Clarke 2015). Where it is taken as bycatch, it is mainly retained (as byproduct) but when released, at-vessel-mortality varies by gear: in gillnets, it ranges from 2–73% and on longlines it is reported as 0% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Tope is a bycatch that is discarded in some fisheries but retained in others and is an important target species for recreational fisheries in some areas (ICES 2019). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommended landings be limited to 376 t annually in 2018 and 2019 (ICES 2019). Landings data are incomplete, as some landings are reported in aggregated landings categories, for example, 'Dogfish and Hounds', and not all range states report species-specific data. The annual reported species-specific Tope landings of the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation (2005–2018) across ICES areas were 542–715 t (ICES 2019). In the western Mediterranean Sea and northwest Africa, the species is a bycatch of a range of fisheries, with landings of 300 t in 2011 (McCully <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, the species has been subject to periods of intensive fishing in its entire area of distribution since about the mid-1940s, that includes increasing artisanal fishing pressure (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006). In Uruguay, artisanal fisheries targeting Tope with gillnet and longline were significant fisheries during 1940–1980 but severely declined after 2000 with the disappearance of the Tope targeted with longline (Marín <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is still landed as bycatch of several other fisheries; in Argentina, for example, in 2015 it represented ~2% of the 30,000 t of total chondrichthyan landings, that is ~ 600 t of Tope was landed (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In southern Africa, Tope is both targeted and a byproduct with catches of 100–400 t annually in demersal and pelagic line, trawl, gillnet, and recreational fisheries (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, Tope is taken as bycatch at low levels with the main fisheries in which it is taken declining in effort due to implementation of management measures (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, COSEWIC 2007). Demersal trawl and trammel net fisheries targeting groundfish landed small quantities of Tope in California during 1876‒1936. In response to a demand for shark liver oil beginning in 1937, a gillnet fishery expanded rapidly throughout Californian Pacific waters and south along the Baja Peninsular in Mexico and into the Gulf of California (Ripley 1946, Walker 1999), and subsequently north to Canadian waters off British Columbia (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). The catch peaked at &gt;4,000 t (live mass) in 1939 and then rapidly fell to 287 t by 1944 with the depletion of stocks (Walker 1999). About 840,000 individuals, primarily large adults, were killed for their livers from 1937‒1949, of which ~40,000 were landed in Canadian ports and an additional unknown number were caught off, but landed outside, Canada (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Recent Canadian bycatch has averaged 0.5 t/year and 1.8 t/year since 2006 in the trawl and hook and line fisheries, respectively, with mandatory release since 2011. During 1976‒1994, of 100‒380 t of Tope landed on the US west coast, most was landed in California, but during 1990‒2004 catch levels in California were about half those during 1977‒1989 (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pondella and Allen 2008). Landings in US waters for 1990–2016 totalled 840 t, of which 816 t was caught in California (NOAA 2018). Estimates of the catches during a long history of recreational fishing are unavailable (Ebert 2001).<br/><br/>In Australia, the fishing effort on this species is mainly in the Shark Gillnet and Shark Hook sectors of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Tope was historically the main target species, but since its biomass was reduced by 1990, it is now a byproduct of targeting Gummy Shark (<em>Mustelus antarcticus</em>), with the take of Tope strictly managed to reduce catch and to support its recovery through a total allowable catch (TAC) of 225 t, closed areas, and trip limits; annual catches are now ~150–200 t (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). Catches across the rest of Australia are much lower at ~24 t annually (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). In New Zealand, catches of this species peaked in 1984 and have been ~3,000 t annually with a current TAC of 3,107 t.<br/><br/>In the Southeast Pacific, catches of Tope throughout the waters of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile are low despite intensive and diverse fisheries, including the widespread use of gillnets of mesh sizes 50–200 mm (Reyes and Oporto 1994, Doherty 2014), which are particularly efficient for the capture of the species. In Ecuador and Peru, there is no mention of Tope in chondrichthyan species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (Martinez 1999, Anon. 2014). In Chile during 1976–1995, reported annual catches were often zero but increased from zero to 11 ton in 1979, to a peak of 36 ton in 1980, and then decreased to 6 ton in 1992, and subsequently to zero (Pequeño and Lamilla 1997). Since that time, official landings statistics to 2017 include only 1 ton for 2009. As an unimportant fishery product, much of the catch is likely unreported (F. Concha, Biología y Conservación de Condrictios, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile, pers. comm. 20 January 2020). Visual inspection and DNA testing of landed shark fins in Chile also indicate low catches of Tope (Sebastian <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality are habitat degradation in potential nursery areas that can negatively affect recruitment, and installation of high voltage direct current sub-sea cables across their migration lanes that may affect feeding and navigation (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006).","<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Genetic and tagging data support up to six separate subpopulations of Tope (Ward and Gardner 1997, Chabot and Allen 2009, Chabot 2015, Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2015, Devloo-Delva <em>et al. </em>2019): Northeast Atlantic (including the Mediterranean Sea), southern Africa (Namibia to East London, South Africa), Southwest Atlantic (southern Brazil to Patagonia), Northeast Pacific (British Columbia to southern Baja California including the Gulf of California), Southeast Pacific (Ecuador to Chile), and Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). There is evidence of some genetic similarity between the South American subpopulations (Bester-van der Merwe <em>et al. </em>2017). Within each of the six subpopulations, the species makes extensive movements, but there is no evidence of mixing among the separate genetically-distinct subpopulations (Chabot 2015, Hernández <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from five sources: (1) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (ICES 2019); (2) nominal CPUE in the Southwest Atlantic (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2019); (3) stock assessment biomass from South Africa (Winker <em>et al. </em>2019. H. Winker pers. comm. 21 January 2020); (4) stock assessment biomass from Australia (Thomas and Punt 2009); and, (5) standardized CPUE from longline and gillnet in New Zealand (Dunn and Bian 2018). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2019, Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, three fishery-independent survey standardized CPUE were available from the northern (2005–2018) and southern areas (1997–2016) of the Celtic Seas Ecoregion (all trawl data) and from the Azores (1990–2015) (longline data) (ICES 2019). An exploratory trend analysis was undertaken that included these three surveys and additional trawl survey data from the North Sea (1992–2016; ICES 2019). However, given that ICES (2019) identified likely taxonomic confusion between Tope and Smooth-hound (<em>Mustelus</em> spp.) in some of the North Sea trawl survey data, the North Sea data were excluded from the present assessment. The three fishery-independent datasets were used to also represent the Mediterranean Sea, as that is part of the Northeast Atlantic Tope subpopulation (Colloca <em>et al. </em>2019). Data from the MEDITS trawl survey program in the Mediterranean Sea (1994–2015) was not reported as CPUE and as such, was not able to be included in the trend analyses, however it indicated that Tope has a low frequency of occurrence (Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Northeast Atlantic survey data may not be fully representative of stock status due to the low catchability of Tope in these fishery-independent surveys and annual peaks associated with large catches of individual hauls; as such, caution is advised in interpretation of these data (ICES 2019). The combined data indicate declining catches till the 2000s when catches began to slowly increase. The trend analysis of these survey data combined for 1990–2018 (29 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.7%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 76.6% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. This trend is largely driven by higher catch rates at the start of the time-series, with data from the latter part of the time-series indicating more stable trends (ICES 2019). The exploratory analyses that included the North Sea data resulted in a reduction of 91.5% over three generation lengths, yet the differences in the trend analyses for this subpopulation between inclusion and exclusion of the North Sea data did not affect the likely status of the overall global trend analysis.<br/><br/>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, Tope declined dramatically in importance in the commercial chondrichthyan catch in Argentina, declining from 40% to 2% during 1984–2015, where the Tope fishery also collapsed at the end of the century (Chiaramonte <em>et al.</em> 2016). A matrix population model of data from Bahía San Blas found a decrease in the subpopulation at an average annual rate of 6.7% to 12.8% from 1998–2001 (Lucifora 2003). The nominal CPUE from Argentina for 1992–2015 (24 years) was available from demersal trawl fisheries (referred to as 'coastal' and 'ice' trawlers in Argentina) (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2019). The trend analysis revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.9%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.3% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Third, in South Africa, a JABBA stock assessment indicated declining stocks for 1952–2016 (65 years) (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The current biomass is 10–14% of pre-exploitation levels (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The data used for the assessment was from scientific surveys and commercial catches in the demersal shark longline, line, and trawl fisheries (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The trend analysis of the biomass estimates from the stock assessment (H. Winker pers. comm. 21 January 2020) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 91.4% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, in Australia, stock assessments indicated that the current biomass is &lt;20% of unexploited levels and the stock is considered overfished (Patterson<em> et al. </em>2018). Trawl CPUE available since ~1994 is considered a poor indicator of the abundance of Tope in southern Australia because the catch is predominantly large males mostly taken in small numbers from a small part of the species’ range in deep water. Changes in targeting practices by the fishers since 2001 create the same issue of bias as for gillnet CPUE. Since 2001, catches of Tope have been managed with a low total allowable catch (TAC) and this catch has been stable, albeit at a very low level. The biomass is classed by the Australian government as overfished at a level below 20% of the pre-fishing level and the fishing mortality is classed uncertain (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018). The trend analysis of the stock assessment abundance for 1927–2000 (74 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 90.1% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fifth, in New Zealand, standardized catch-per-unit-effort was available for longline from 5 areas and for gillnet from 4 areas (Dunn and Bian 2018). The combined data show a general decline during the 1990s followed by a rise in catches in the early 2000s and then fluctuations in catches across areas and gear (Dunn and Bian 2018). The high fluctuations in these data may be due to varying patterns of fishing and/or migration of Tope both spatially and temporally. The trend analysis of the combined longline and gillnet data from 1990–2016 (27 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 29.8% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths. Whilst Australia and New Zealand are part of the same subpopulation, they are treated as separate stocks for the purposes of fisheries and conservation management, and risk assessments within Australia and New Zealand. The exchange of large mature animals between the two stocks of Australia and New Zealand has been established by tag release-recapture (Hurst <em>et al. </em>2008, Walker<em> et al.</em> 2008), and some interbreeding between the two stocks established by genetic studies (Hernández <em>et al. </em>2015). However, most animals in the two stocks are too small to move across the Tasman Sea and there are separate pupping grounds in Australia and New Zealand.<br/><br/>In addition, in the Northeast Pacific, in California, a historic targeted Tope fishery collapsed due to overfishing from 1938–1944 (Pondella and Allen 2008). This dramatic decline occurred ~76 years ago, almost three generation lengths (79 years). The subpopulation did not show any signs of recovery until prohibitions in 1994 on the use of inshore gillnets and trammel nets. The prohibitions were for the White Sea Bass (<em>Atractosciaon nobilis</em>) and Giant Sea Bass (<em>Stereolepis gigas</em>) but also reduced the catch of inshore Tope. Gillnet surveys in the southern California Bight showed an increasing trend of Tope during 1977–2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008). Given there was no increase in the total Californian commercial landings of Tope during 1997–2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008), the rise in the CPUE during the surveys is more consistent with a localized increase in the abundance from the combined effects of improved survival of young animals inshore and older animals recolonizing inshore waters, rather than indicative of a widespread increase in abundance of Tope in all Californian waters. It does indicate, however, that localized stocks can recover following management that prohibits catch.<br/><br/>Across the regions with analysed subpopulation and stock trends, Tope was estimated to have steeply declined in the Southwest Atlantic, southern Africa, Australia, and to a lesser extent in the Northeast Atlantic and New Zealand. All of these subpopulations and stocks, with the exception of New Zealand, are estimated to have the highest probability to have undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (79 years). In New Zealand, the stock is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 30–49% over three generation lengths (79 years). The data quality used for the trend estimates varies from robust stock assessments in Australia and South Africa, to standardized CPUE in Northeast Atlantic (noting the caveats above) and New Zealand, and nominal CPUE in Southwest Atlantic; the CPUEs may not fully represent actual abundances but are the best available data. In the Northeast Pacific, the subpopulation collapsed in the early 1940s, with no recovery until 1997–2004 when localized management led to localized increase in abundance. The consistent steepness of decline across most of the analyzed time-series over the past three generation lengths together with the lack of movement between the subpopulations is cause for serious concern. The trend data were used for the estimation of a global population trend; the estimated three generation subpopulation trend for each region was weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 88%, with the highest probability of a &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (79 years).<br/><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

is widely distributed in cold to warm temperate waters of most oceans. It occurs in the Northeast, Eastern Central, Southwest and Southeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern Indian, and in the Southwest, Southeast, Western Central, Eastern Central, and Northeast Pacific. It is absent from the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, the Northwest Pacific, and the Western Indian (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Tope is used for its meat and fins, and historically for the liver oil (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2006, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"There are some regulations in place for Tope. In 2020, Tope was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which obligates Parties to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, European Union vessels are prohibited to land Tope captured on longlines over a large part of its northern European range in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) waters (ICES 2019). In the United Kingdom, since 2008, it has been prohibited to fish for Tope other than using rod and line (with anglers fishing using rod and line from boats not allowed to land their catch) with bycatch of Tope caught in other commercial gears limited to 45 kilograms per day (ICES 2019). In the Mediterranean Sea, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in 2012 banned retention and mandated careful release for Tope and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, seasonal no-take areas provide some protection to Tope. Like other large sharks, Tope is protected by regional, national, and provincial legislation in Argentina whereby all sharks larger than 160 cm TL (the largest Tope in Southwest Atlantic is 155 cm TL) must be discarded alive and cannot be landed in any Argentinean port (Undersecretariat of Fisheries, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2009). The Province of Buenos Aires prohibits the landing of Tope in recreational fisheries (Ministry of Agrarian Affairs, Province of Buenos Aires 2007). However, enforcement is difficult and large sharks are still landed.<br/><br/>In Australia, the species was listed as Conservation Dependent in 2009 on the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </em>(EPBC Act), and there is a species-specific School Shark Rebuilding Strategy and other management measures to reduce catch (DEE 2009, AFMA 2015, Woodhams and Curtotti 2018). These measures in southern Australia include: all live-caught Tope to be released, limited entry for the use of gillnets and longlines, total allowable catch, gear restrictions, and permanent and seasonal closures for nursery and breeding areas (Walker 1999, Walker and Gason 2007, Woodhams and Curtotti 2018). Spatial closures to the Shark Gillnet Sector were implemented in all Victorian coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) since 1988, and in South Australia implemented since 2003 (Penney <em>et al.</em> 2014). The Commonwealth South-East and South-West Marine Park Networks implemented since 2013 provide refuge for Tope. <br/><br/>In New Zealand, Tope are managed under the Quota Management System with Individual Transferable Quotas (Finucci <em>et al.</em> 2019). They are also included in recreational bag limits of 20–30 fish per day.<br/><br/>In the mortheast Pacific, Tope was designated as Special Concern by COSEWIC in 2007 and was listed under Canada’s Species at Risk Act, Schedule 1 as Special Concern in 2009. Careful mandatory release in Canada since 2011 and 100% observer cover to monitor release has resulted in a very low level of mortality. A management plan for Tope was created by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 2012, calling for more research on the species’ ecology and biology in Canadian waters, in addition to ongoing improvements to bycatch information.<br/><br/>Further research is required on population size and trends, and catch rates should be monitored.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

2911619,39374,Carcharhinus longimanus,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Oceanic Whitetip Shark (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>) is a large (to 350 cm total length) wide-ranging, oceanic species of tropical and temperate seas worldwide with a preference for surface waters, though it has been reported to depths of 1,082 m. It has litters of 1–15 pups and likely has a biennial reproductive cycle. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries and is often retained for the meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species has a high catchability due to its preference for surface waters and its inquisitive nature. Steep population declines have occurred in all oceans. The Oceanic Whitetip Shark was once one of the most abundant pelagic shark species in tropical seas worldwide but is now rare in some regions. The <a name=""_Hlk526521317"">global population is estimated</a>  to have undergone a reduction of &gt;98%, with the highest probability of &gt;80%  reduction over three generation lengths (61.2 years). Therefore, the  Oceanic Whitetip Shark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Oceanic Whitetip is one of the most widespread sharks, ranging  across entire oceans in tropical and subtropical waters (Young <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an  oceanic-epipelagic shark usually found far offshore in the open sea with a preference for surface waters, but it has been reported to depths of 1,082 m (Bonfil <em>et al. </em>2008, Tolotti <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weigmann 2016).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 350 cm total length (TL)<em></em>, possibly 395 cm TL; males mature at 168–198 cm TL and females at 175–224 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016, D'Alberto <em>et al</em>. 2017). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups and litter size increases with female size; gestation period is 10–12 months with most likely a biennial reproductive cycle and size at birth of 57–77 cm TL (Seki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998,&#160;Bonfil <em>et al. </em>2008, Last and Stevens 2009, Clarke<em> et al.</em> 2015). Consequently, the rate of population increase is very low and has been estimated at 0.039–0.067 (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008), or 0.110 (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2008), although these may be overestimates as they are based on younger age-at-maturity and maximum age than has since been reported. There is regional variation in age estimates: female age-at-maturity is  4.5–8.8, 6.5, and 15.8 years, and maximum age is 11, 17, and 24.9 years in Northwest  Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Western Central Pacific,  respectively (Seki <em>et al.</em> 1998, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liu and Tsai 2011, Joung<em> et al. </em>2016, D'Alberto<em> et al.</em>  2017). Studies have verified annual periodicity of band formation but  none have yet validated the age estimates. Using the precautionary  approach, the older age-at-maturity of 15.8 years and maximum age of  24.9 years are used to calculate a generation length of 20.4 years across all  regions.","<p>  </p><p>The Oceanic Whitetip Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is often retained for fins, and sometimes, the meat (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>,</em>Clarke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al.</em>  2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of  catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke  2015)<em></em>. At vessel mortality of 34.2% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012). The species has an inquisitive nature that increases its catchability (Ebert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","There are no data available on the global population size of the Oceanic Whitetip Shark. Genetic studies suggest there may be some genetic structure between the Western Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, however the data are preliminary and stock structures require further investigation (Camargo <em>et al</em>. 2016, Ruck <em>et al</em>. 2016, Young <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from six sources: (1) standardized catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) in the Northwest Atlantic (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017); (2) standardized CPUE in the Southwest Atlantic (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2013); (3) standardized CPUE in Hawaii (Brodziak and Walsh 2013); (4) stock assessment biomass in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) (Rice and Harley 2012); (5) updated standardized CPUE in the WCPO (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015); and, (6) standardized CPUE from the Spanish longline fishery in the Indian Ocean (Ramos-Cartelle <em>et al</em>. 2012). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the observer CPUE time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992–2015 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had declined from the 1990s to 2000s, after which it fluctuated but then remained relatively steady (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017). It was noted that fishing pressure had been present for decades prior to 1992 and that the species had likely experienced significant historical declines of 50 to 88% in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, respectively (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992–2015 (24 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 93.1% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017), the annual rate of reduction in the time-series produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, robust catch data from the South Atlantic are lacking (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017). Observer CPUE data from the Brazil longline fishery from 2004–2010 showed a slight increase in abundance, however the data are from a short time-series and were susceptible to changes in fishing strategy during those years (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2013). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 2004–2010 (7 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 13.9%, consistent with an increasing abundance over three generation lengths (61.2 years). These CPUE data are from a large area around Brazil, but they may not be representative of the entire South Atlantic region. A more comprehensive analysis of catch rates of Oceanic Whitetip Shark on longlines in the South Atlantic revealed steep declines of 85% in the average CPUE from 1980–2011 (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016), however because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analysed over three generations.<br/><br/>The third to the fifth data sources are all from the Pacific. Third, the observer standardized CPUE from the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery for 1995–2010 indicated a highly significant decline of 90% over the time-series (Brodziak and Walsh 2013). The trend analysis of the same data for 1995–2010 (16 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 16.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 100.0% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Fourth, the stock assessment based on observer longline data from the WCPO for 1995–2009 indicated an 86% decline in spawning stock biomass and that the stock of Oceanic Whitetip Shark is overfished with overfishing occurring (Rice and Harley 2012). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1995–2009 (15 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 14.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 100.0% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Fifth, updated standardized CPUE data from the WCPO observer longline data from 1996–2014 indicate continuing declines with the stock likely maintaining an overfished status (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015). The trend analysis of the same time series for 1996–2014 (19 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 98.6% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Sixth, the standardized CPUE from the Spanish longline fishery in the Indian Ocean from 1998–2011 was highly variable, influenced by the low-prevalence of the species in some years, and not considered a plausible indicator of stock abundance (Ramos-Cartelle <em>et al</em>. 2012). The trend analysis of the same time series for 1998–2011(14 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 92.9% over three generation lengths (61.2 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Data from the Japanese longline fishery in the Indian Ocean was not analyzed due to unrealistic CPUE in the early years of the time-series, although in the latter years from 2003–2011, there is a generally decreasing trend (Yokawa and Semba 2012).<br/><br/>Further to the above CPUE trend analyses, in the Eastern Pacific, nominal catches of Oceanic Whitetip Shark in purse seine fisheries have declined by 80–95% from the late 1990s to 2009 (Hall and Roman 2013, Young <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the Arabian Seas region, the species is inferred to have declined by &gt;80% over the last three generations (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>This species was historically one of the most abundant shark species in tropical seas worldwide, and regional trends indicate it has experienced significant historical declines across its range, likely continues to experience global declines in abundance, and it is now rare in some regions (Young <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was estimated to have severely declined in all oceans, including the South Atlantic. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of WCPO data were used to generate two global trends that both gave essentially the same result. The overall estimated median reduction was 98–100%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (61.2 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Oceanic Whitetip Shark occurs worldwide in tropical and temperate waters (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>The species is used for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). The Oceanic Whitetip Shark accounted for 1.8% in 1991–2001 and 0.6% in 2014, of the fin imported in Hong Kong (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). In some regions, the meat of juvenile Oceanic Whitetip Shark is sold fresh for human consumption at local markets.</p>",Marine,"<p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. </p>  <p>The Oceanic Whitetip Shark was the first (and is still currently the only) shark species to be subject to prohibitions on retention, transhipment, storage, and landing by all four major Regional Fishery Management Organizations (RFMOs) focused on tuna fisheries: the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (2010), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (2011), the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (2012), and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (2013). </p>  <p>In 2013, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which requires exports from CITES Parties to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.</p>  <p>In 2018, the Oceanic Whitetip Shark was added to Annex 1 of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Migratory Sharks, even though the species is not (yet) included on the CMS Appendices. The MoU is aimed at facilitating regional conservation of listed shark and ray species. </p>  <p>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Oceanic Whitetip Shark retention and landings be prohibited, in line with tuna RFMO obligations, at least as long as the global population is classified as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Initiatives to prevent capture, minimize bycatch mortality, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global

The global population structure varies between males and females; males  move across ocean basins, while females only move regionally. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in  pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet  fisheries, and is retained for the meat and fins. The Scalloped Hammerhead has undergone steep declines in all oceans, with some signs of stabilization  and possible recovery in response to management only in the Northwest  Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The weighted global population trend estimated median reductions of 76.9–97.3%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years), and is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Scalloped Hammerhead is a coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark,  found over continental and insular shelves and nearby deep water, ranging from the intertidal and surface usually to 275 m depth, though has been recorded to 1,043 m (Moore and Gates 2015). Adults spend most of the time offshore in midwater and females migrate  to the coastal areas to pup (Clarke 1971, Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975, Klimley and Nelson 1984, Branstetter 1987, Klimley 1987, Chen <em>et al.</em> 1988, Stevens and Lyle 1989). It reaches a maximum size of 370–420 cm total length (TL) (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Males mature at 140–198 cm TL and females at 200–250 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Branstetter 1987, Chen <em>et al. </em>1990, Carrera and Martinez 2007, White<em> et al.</em> 2008, Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011).  Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 12–41, an annual or biennial reproductive cycle, and a size at birth of 31–57 cm TL (Branstetter 1987, Chen<em> et al. </em>1988, 1990; Stevens and Lyle 1989, Oliveira 1991, Amorim <em>et al</em>. 1994, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 1997, White <em>et al</em>. 2008, Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011, Clarke <em>et al. </em>2015, Gallagher and Klimley 2018). Annual band pair deposition for the Scalloped Hammerhead is assumed based on bomb radiocarbon validation of the Great Hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>) (Passerotti<em> et al.</em> 2010); female age-at-maturity of the Scalloped Hammerhead is 13.2 years and maximum age is 35 years; generation length is  therefore 24.1 years (Drew <em>et al.</em> 2015). Population growth rate estimates are 0.10–1.22 per year (Harry 2011, Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2012).","<p>  </p><p>The Scalloped Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al.</em> 2019). The species is also taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Reid&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</p>  <p>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species has high at-vessel mortality of 57.1% on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic, 62.9% on United States shark bottom-longlines, and 71.4% for Western Australian demersal longlines (Coelho <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gulak&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). The post-release mortality is higher for injured released  sharks and has been reported as 100% for the Scalloped Hammerhead in  purse seines (Eddy <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;</p>","<p>  </p>There are no data available on the population size of the Scalloped Hammerhead. Genetic data reveal that the global population structure varies between males and females. Only males move across ocean basins, while females only move regionally and not between discontinuous continental coastlines (Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2006, Daly-Engel <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Four sets of population trend data are available: (1) a stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Jiao <em>et al</em>. 2011); and from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (J. Carlson and W.B. Driggers unpubl. data); (3) the South Pacific (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010); and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). For the South Pacific, there is bather protection mesh and drumline CPUE (Noriega <em>et al</em>. 2011), yet these data spanned only one decade and were not considered in the global analysis. The above trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely Red List Category percent change over three generations (see Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>First, the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stock assessment indicated that the stock was overfished (B&lt;Bmsy) from the early 1980s with overfishing (F&gt;Fmsy) occurring periodically from 1983–2005 (Jiao et al. 2011). The steepest declines occurred prior to 1995, thereafter the abundance index remained stable until the end of the time series in 2005. The trend analysis of the modelled population abundance for 1981–2005 (25 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 7.5% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.6% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, more recent data (1994–2017) are available from the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico comprising two of the time-series underlying the Jiao <em>et al</em>. (2011) stock assessment (J. Carlson and W.B. Driggers unpubl. data). Both time-series indicate this population has begun to increase soon after the implementation of management. The annual fisheries-independent bottom longline surveys (Grace and Henwood 1998) were conducted throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico and Northwest Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories; called the NMFS Mississippi bottom longline shark survey (NMFS-LL-SE, in number of sharks per 10,000 hook hours; Ingram et al. 2005). These data (red in the Supplementary Information) exhibit a steep increase in CPUE from 2010 onwards. Additionally, the commercial shark bottom longline fishery is active in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean from around North Carolina to Florida and throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico (BLLOP) (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2009). These data (green in the Supplementary Information) exhibited a slight, but variable increasing trend. Both time-series taken together for 1994–2017 (24 years) demonstrated a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (72.3 years).<br/><br/>Third, the analysis of the South Pacific Queensland Shark Control Program’s bather protection netting program population abundance for 1964–2004 (41 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 8.4% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.8% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the analysis of the Indian Ocean Natal Sharks Board bather protection netting program population abundance for 1978–2003 (26 years) yielded annual rates of reduction of 4.0% consistent with an estimated median reduction of 93.4% over three generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/>In addition to these population trend analyses, we considered a recent analysis of fishery-dependent longline CPUE from the South Atlantic. These time-series are complex, reflecting access by different fleets and nationalities over time, but the best estimates of trends come from phase B spanning 1998 to 2008 during which 20 fleets (100 vessels) fished for tunas, swordfishes, and sharks. During this 10-year period there was a 61.7% decline in CPUE of hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.) (Table S11, Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016), however, because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analysed over three generations.<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Scalloped Hammerhead was estimated to have undergone steep declines in all oceans, with some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management only in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of Atlantic data were used to generate two global trends. This resulted in a median reduction of 76.9–97.3%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years), and therefore the Scalloped Hammerhead is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,The Scalloped Hammerhead has a circumglobal distribution in coastal warm-temperate and tropical seas (Ebert <em>et al </em>2013).,"<p>  </p><p>The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are among the main shark species in the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke<em> et al.</em> 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018). Three species of hammerhead shark, Scalloped Hammerhead, Great Hammerhead, and Smooth Hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna zygaena</em>), collectively accounted for 4% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018).

The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Scalloped Hammerhead as a 'key shark species' in 2010, but has yet to adopt hammerhead catch limits. Several proposals to ban hammerhead landings and/or set regional hammerhead fishing limits through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have been defeated. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) has yet to act on 2018 scientific advice to adopt Scalloped Hammerhead fishery management measures. </p>  <p>In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Scalloped Hammerhead and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II.

In 2013, the Scalloped Hammerhead was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which requires CITES Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2014, the Scalloped Hammerhead was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation.

2920499,39386,Sphyrna mokarran,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-11-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Great Hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna mokarran</em>) is a large (to 610 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in tropical and warm temperate seas to depths of 300 m. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and  gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins. It has a  long lifespan of up to 44 years and only breeds once every two years,  which combined with high bycatch mortality, makes it susceptible to depletion where it is taken in unmanaged  fisheries. The Great Hammerhead appears to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic prior to management measures, where slow recovery may now be occurring in the Northwest Atlantic. The global population is estimated to have undergone reductions of 50.9–62.4%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1–74.4 years). There is a lack of data from the Pacific, limited regional representation of some time-series, intensive fisheries in data-poor regions that are suspected to have driven significant declines, and uncertainty about levels of exploitation that are potentially similar to those of the Scalloped Hammerhead (<em>S. lewini</em>) (which has been assessed as globally Critically Endangered). Expert judgement elicitation thus used a precautionary approach and concurred with the highest probability of reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (71.1–74.4 years). The Great Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Great Hammerhead is a generally solitary, coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, that occurs close inshore and well offshore at depths ranging  from near-surface to 300 m deep (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). The maximum size is reported as 550 to 610 cm total length (TL) reported by Compagno (1984), though 400 cm TL is a more commonly observed maximum size (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Last and Stevens 2009, Piercy <em>et al. </em>2010, Harry <em>et al. </em>2011). Males mature at 225–269 cm TL and females mature at 210–300 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry <em>et al. </em>2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with litter size of 6–42 pups, a gestation time of 11 months, a likely biennial reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 50–70 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Harry <em>et al. </em>2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Clarke <em>et al. </em>2015). There is regional variation in age estimates; female age-at-maturity is 5.5 and 8.3 years and maximum age is 44 and 39 years; generation length is therefore 24.8 and 23.7 years in Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Pacific, respectively (Passerotti <em>et al. </em>2010, Piercy <em>et al. </em>2010, Harry <em>et al. </em>2011). Population growth rate estimate is 0.07 per year (Cortés <em>et al. </em>2012).","<p>  </p><p>The Great Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lack and Meere 2009, Diop and Dossa 2011, Miller<em> et al. </em>2014). The species is often retained for the fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>At-vessel mortality is estimated as 56% on U.S. shark bottom-longlines and 30.8% on Western Australia demersal longlines (Gulak <em>et al. </em>2015,  Braccini and Waltrick 2019). The post-release mortality is higher for injured released sharks and has been reported as 100% for  the closely-related Scalloped Hammerhead in purse seines (Eddy <em>et al.</em>  2016). The species is taken in beach protection programs that target  large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the global population size of the Great Hammerhead. Genetic studies support two subpopulations of Great Hammerhead, the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific (Testerman 2014). No genetic structure was found within the Atlantic or within the Indo-Pacific between eastern and western Australia (Testerman 2014).<br/></p><p>Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Jiao <em>et al.</em> 2011), and from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (J. Carlson unpubl. data) and, (3) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation  lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker  <em>et al.</em> 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a  median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the  most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three  generations (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p>First, the Northwest Atlantic stock assessment indicated that the stock was overfished from the mid-1980s with overfishing occurring periodically from 1983–1997 and the risk of overfishing low after 2001 (Jiao<em> et al.</em> 2011). A previous stock assessment also found the stock overfished but experiencing overfishing after 2001 (Hayes 2008); however, both stock assessments report a high degree of uncertainty mostly due to poor catch data (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2014). The trend analysis<strong> </strong>of the Northwest Atlantic modeled abundance for 1981–2005 (25 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 29.1% over three generation lengths (74.4 years), with the  highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths.</p>  <p>Second, more recent data (1994–2017) are available from the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico comprising two of the time-series underlying the Jiao <em>et al. </em>(2011) stock assessment (J. Carlson unpubl. data). Both time-series indicate this population has begun to increase soon after the implementation of management after 2005 (NMFS 2006). The annual fisheries-independent bottom longline surveys (Grace and Henwood 1998) were conducted throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Mississippi Laboratories; called the NMFS Mississippi bottom longline shark survey (NMFS-LL-SE; Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2005). These data (red in the Supplementary Information) exhibit an increase in CPUE from 2005 onwards. Additionally, the commercial shark bottom longline fishery is active in the U.S. Atlantic Ocean from around North Carolina to Florida and throughout the eastern Gulf of Mexico (BLLOP) (Morgan <em>et al.</em> 2009). These data (green in the Supplementary Information) exhibited an increasing but variable trend. Both time-series taken together for 1994–2017 (24 years) demonstrated a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (74.4 years).</p><p></p><p>  </p>Third, the analysis of population abundance from the Indian Ocean Natal Shark’s Board bather protection netting program for 1978–2003 (26 years) (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) yielded annual rates of reduction of 6.5% consistent with a median reduction of 99.3% over three generation lengths (71.1 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths<p></p><p></p><p>In addition to these population trend analyses, we considered a recent analysis of fishery-dependent longline CPUE from the South Atlantic. These time-series are complex, reflecting access by different fleets and nationalities over time, but the best estimates of trends come from phase B spanning 1998 to 2008 during which 20 fleets (170 vessels) fished for tunas, swordfishes, and sharks. During this 10-year period there was a 61.7% decline in CPUE of hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.) (Table S11, Barreto <em>et al. </em>2016), however, because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analyzed over three generations. <br/></p><p>Steep declines of hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.) have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al.</em>  (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial  and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys and sighting  records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in  the northwest Mediterranean Sea. Of the taxa for which there were  enough data to investigate, hammerhead sharks declined the fastest;  disappearing from coastal waters after 1963 followed by declines (across all fishing sectors) in pelagic waters by the early 1980s.  Meta-analysis showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in  abundance of -0.17 (time range 178 years) and biomass of -0.36 (time  range 107 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.99% in  abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008). Walker <em>et al.</em> (2005) also report that hammerhead species have virtually disappeared from the central-southern Mediterranean Sea since 1986. <br/></p><p>Population trend data are lacking from the North Pacific and are limited from the Western Central Pacific, where hammerhead catches are for the species-complex, with no indication of the proportion of Great Hammerheads. The CPUE (1995–2015) was highly variable and as Great Hammerhead are captured infrequently, little inference was possible from the temporal trend (Rice <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fishing pressure has significantly increased in recent decades across the distribution range of the Great Hammerhead in the tropical Indian Ocean and West Africa (Cooke 1997, Bruckner <em>et al. </em>2011, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2012, ANSD 2016, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017), and has likely caused declines in these regions.</p>The Great Hammerhead was estimated to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean with the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico showing historic declines but some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management. The Atlantic subpopulation is inferred to have undergone a &gt;50% reduction over three generation lengths (74.4 years); although there is possible recovery in the Northwest Atlantic, there is also a high degree of uncertainty in the data and high levels of exploitation. The Indo-Pacific subpopulation is inferred to have undergone a &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1 years). To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions were weighted according to the relative size of each region; the two sources of Atlantic data were used to generate two global trends. This resulted in a median reduction of 50.9–62.4%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction in both trends over three generation lengths (71.1–74.4 years). However, the area of some time-series is limited relative to the region and may not accurately represent the trend in Great Hammerhead across the entire region. There is uncertainty in some of the catch data and levels of exploitation. Exploitation levels may be similar to those of those of the Scalloped  Hammerhead, though this is not definitively known, and the regions with no trend data are likely areas where the species is under intensive fishing pressure, such as the tropical Indian Ocean and West Africa. Hence, a precautionary approach was taken and expert judgement elicitation inferred a  global population reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths  (71.1–74.4 years). Therefore, the Great Hammerhead is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Great Hammerhead ranges worldwide throughout tropical and warm temperate seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","<p>The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are a significant component of the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke<em> et al.</em> 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018). Three species of hammerhead shark, Great Hammerhead, Scalloped Hammerhead<em>, </em>and Smooth Hammerhead (<em>S. zygaena</em>), collectively accounted for 4% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018). The meat, liver oil, skin, cartilage, and jaws may also be used (White<em> et al. </em>2006, Lack and Meere 2009, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2014, Glaus <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>",Marine,"<p>  </p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. </p>  <p>In 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) prohibited retention, transshipment, landing, and sale of Great Hammerheads (and other hammerhead species) for ICCAT fisheries operating in the Convention Area. There are exceptions for local consumption in developing countries, provided they cap catches, meet catch data reporting requirements, and ensure fins are not traded internationally. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Great Hammerhead as a 'key shark species' in 2010, but has yet to adopt hammerhead catch limits. </p><p>In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Great Hammerhead and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Several proposals to ban hammerhead landings and/or set regional hammerhead fishing limits through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have been defeated. In 2013, the Great Hammerhead was added to Appendix II of the Convention  on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) based on its  similarity to the Scalloped Hammerhead. The listing requires CITES  Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on  findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In  2014, the Great Hammerhead was listed on Appendix II of the Convention  on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work  regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS  Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at  facilitating conservation. </p>    <p>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Great Hammerhead retention and landings be prohibited, at least as long as the global population is classified as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Initiatives to prevent capture, minimize bycatch mortality, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It reaches a maximum size of 138 cm total length (TL); females mature at 86–91 cm TL and males at 70 cm TL (Lessa <em>et al. </em>1986, Martins <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 4–12 pups (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). This species has an estimated age-at-maturity of 9 years and a maximum age of 28 years, and thus a generation length of 18.5 years (Lessa <em>et al. </em>1986, Vooren and Klippel 2005). It has a moderate maximum annual intrinsic rate of population increase (r<sub>max</sub>, year<sup>-1</sup>) compared to other guitarfishes, with median estimates of 0.13–0.26 (D'Alberto<em> et al. </em>2019). <br/><br/>Its seasonal migration and breeding cycle in southern Brazil are described below, from data published by Lessa (1982), Lessa <em>et al. </em>(1986) and Vooren <em>et al.</em> (2005). In southern Brazil, the adults migrate to coastal waters with depths of less than 20 m from November to March. At that time artisanal fisheries operate from the beaches, and the guitarfish catches are 98% pregnant females. Adult males reach the beach fishing grounds at the end of February. Parturition and mating take place in March. Soon after, the males and females return to deeper waters and disperse to depths of 40–150 m over the continental shelf. Newborn pups and juveniles remain in shallow waters throughout the year.","The Brazilian Guitarfish is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal trawl, gillnet, longline, and beach seine fisheries, which are intense across its range. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels in operation (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species is caught in these Brazilian fisheries and is still landed and traded despite legislation to protect it (de-Franco <em>et al.</em> 2012, Bunholi <em>et al.</em> 2018). Fishers in Brazil sometimes land this species illegally and remove part of its snout to disguise it as the Shortsnout Guitarfish (<em>Zapteryx brevirostris</em>), which is legal to land (R. Baretto unpubl. data 2018). The Brazilian Guitarfish is also annually targeted by recreational fisheries in southern Brazil during the summer. Fishers report an average of 10–20 gravid females/fisher/day and the guitarfishes are mostly used for domestic consumption (M. Martins unpubl. data 2020). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al. </em>2011, Lorenzo<em> et al.</em> 2015). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters  increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a  restructuring in 1997 the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in  2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as  many artisanal vessels are not registered. The Brazilian Guitarfish is captured frequently in gillnets and longlines there, is landed, and is sometimes targeted (Laporta <em>et al. </em>2018, Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is also captured in artisanal trawl fisheries there (Segura <em>et al.</em> 2008). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson<em> et al.</em> 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the annual number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). Gillnets are prevalent there and have been known to target elasmobranchs (Chiaramonte 1998, Colautti <em>et al. </em>2010), and do capture this species (Jaureguizar <em>et al.</em> 2015). Furthermore, there are substantial recreational fisheries in Argentina. It is a popular pastime along most of the coast there, and large tournaments with up to 4,000 participants began in the 1960s. These fisheries commonly target this species and are still largely unregulated today (Venerus and Cedrola 2017). This guitarfish may survive if discarded from trawls, as one study showed that only relatively minor injuries occur (Rodrigues <em>et al. </em>2019). Furthermore, the species has a moderate maximum annual intrinsic rate of population increase, and shows some promise for recovery if the appropriate protections and management measures are implemented to keep fishing mortality low (D'Alberto <em>et al. </em>2019). Overall, this guitarfish is subjected to intense and largely unregulated fishing pressure across its range, and there is no refuge at depth.","Commercial and artisanal fisheries pressure is intense on the southern Brazilian shelf off Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, and it is suspected that a steep population reduction has occurred there.&#160;In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, total landings by fishery methods combined increased from  842 t in 1975 to 1,804 t in 1984 and then declined continuously to 157 t  in 2001, which is equivalent to a reduction of &gt;99% scaled over three generations (55.5 years). The average trawl catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of Brazilian Guitarfish  in southern Brazil over the years 1993 to 1999 was 17% of that observed  during 1975 to 1986, indicating a decline in abundance of &gt;80% since  1986 in southern Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2005), equivalent to a reduction of &gt;99% scaled over three generations. While formerly abundant, monitoring of beach-seine catches and reports from fishers confirmed that this guitarfish was scarce in coastal waters by 2004 (Vooren <em>et al. </em>2005). Fishing pressure has not ceased in Brazil. Despite protection, this species is still landed and traded (Bunholi <em>et al. </em>2018), and a further reduction in population size is suspected since the 2000s. <br/><br/>In Uruguay, the catches from research trawls in the 1980s and early 1990s were on average around 1,400 kg/hr, and between 2013 and 2017 were only just over 480 kg/hr (L. Paesch unpubl. data 2018), equivalent to a 94% reduction over three generations. In a 2014–2018 study of artisanal landings there, this species was captured in small- and large-mesh gillnets and longlines, with a frequency of occurrence of 8.9%, 25.5%, and 7.4%, respectively (Laporta <em>et al. </em>2018). <br/><br/>In Argentina, there are intense commercial, artisanal, and recreational fisheries in the <span>Río de la Plata; this species was caught rarely in gillnets in 2009–2010 (Jaureguizar <em>et al. </em>2015), but there is no baseline.&#160;It is suspected that this intense and inadequately managed fishing pressure has led to declines in abundance in Argentina.<span>&#160;<span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span>Overall, due to its moderately unproductive life history, intense and inadequately managed fishing pressure across its range, and documented declines in landings in several parts of its range, it is inferred that the Brazilian Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (55.5 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Brazilian Guitarfish occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to northern Argentina (Menni and Stehmann 2000, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b).","This guitarfish is utilized bycatch across its range, and in some areas is targeted (e.g. Silveira <em>et al. </em>2018).

Charvet unpubl. data 2018).",Marine,"The Brazilian Guitarfish is listed as Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National Red List (Vooren <em>et al.</em> 2018), and is thus listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the Environment No. 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018). This legislation came into force in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al.</em> 2017). The ordinance faces increasing industry pressure, including a court challenge to suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that the Brazilian National Red List was designed specifically for terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). Regardless of the status of this legislation, this species is still landed and traded in Brazil (Bunholi <em>et al. </em>2018). This guitarfish occurs in Anchieta Island State Park, a relatively well-enforced no-take zone in São Paulo state (Silva de Souza <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place in Uruguay or Argentina. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement. Further research is needed on life history and population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring should be undertaken in commercial and artisanal fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deep-water fisheries such as the gillnet fishery targeting monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>) there were considered to be over-exploited by the late 2000s due to governance limitations (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). Overall, this smoothhound is subjected to intense and inadequately managed fisheries across its range, and there is very little refuge at depth.","Inferences about population trends have been drawn from two estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from research trawl surveys in two areas: (1) the southern Brazilian shelf; and, (2) the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone. First, on the southern Brazilian shelf, catches in research trawl surveys declined by 95% between 1981 and 2005 (R. Barreto unpubl. data 2018), equivalent to a &gt;99% reduction over three generations (43.5 years). Second, in the coastal region of the Bonaerensean District of northern Argentina  and Uruguay, biomass of this species in trawl surveys  decreased by 96% between 1994 and 1999 (Massa <em>et al. </em>2002), equivalent to a &gt;99% reduction over three generations. Due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure  across its range, combined with its relatively unproductive life history, its lack of refuge at depth, and declines in CPUE, it is  suspected that this houndshark has undergone a population reduction of  &gt;80% over the past three generations (43.5 years).<br/><strong></strong>",Decreasing,"The Striped Smoothhound occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Santa Catarina, Brazil, to Carmen de Patagones, southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013, Cuevas <em>et al. </em>2018).","This shark is utilized bycatch and is consumed and sold locally.

Reproduction is viviparous, asynchronous, and biannual, and females give birth to 1–4 pups that are estimated to be about 10.5 cm TL after a gestation of 4–5 months (<em></em>Santander-Neto <em>et al. </em>2016). Age-at-maturity is ~2 years and maximum age is 9 years; generation length is estimated at 3.1 years based on a demographic analysis that used an average modeled natural mortality (Santander-Neto 2015).","The Smalleye Round Ray is captured in artisanal beach seines and in artisanal and commercial demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries, which are intense across its range and largely unmanaged. It is typically discarded dead (G. Rincon unpubl. data 2018). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).&#160; Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and catches peaked in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address overexploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to only 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Artisanal trawling has increased substantially since the trawl ban with little management in place. <br/><br/>In Guyana, shrimp trawl fisheries catching elasmobranchs as bycatch included 116 vessels by 2005 and these fisheries were already over-exploited by then (FAO 2005). Suriname fisheries, which have been expanding rapidly since the 1970s, lack management measures and as a result catches of some stocks are declining (Hornby <em>et al. </em>2015). Foreign vessels from the US, Japan, and Korea trawl in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and illegal vessels from depleted areas in Guyana and Venezuela add further pressure. This species is caught frequently as bycatch in the now-managed Atlantic Seabob (<em>Xiphopenaeus kroyeri</em>) shrimp fishery there, which has Marine Stewardship Council  certification but was flagged as having a high ray mortality that needs  to be addressed (Willems<em> et al. </em>2016). Fisheries in French Guiana include industrial fisheries for snapper and shrimp, which are partially foreign access (Harper <em>et al.</em> 2015). Shrimp trawl fisheries began in the 1960s with foreign vessels from the US and Japan which were then replaced in the 1980s by French vessels. Effort peaked in the mid-1990s and has declined since, but it is suspected that this may be largely due to changing environmental conditions that no longer favor shrimp recruitment in these waters (Chaboud and Thébaud 2009, Sanz <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/><br/>Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos<em> et al.</em> 2011).&#160;In northeastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and fishers there report that stocks are over-exploited (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Demographic analysis in one simulation study found evidence of  population declines from scenarios with fishing mortality levels above  0.10 (Santander-Neto 2015), which is much lower than that suspected in all areas of its range. Overall, the Smalleye Round Ray is subjected to intense artisanal and commercial fishing pressure throughout its range, and it has no refuge at depth.","There are few data, but the intensity of fisheries and evidence for disappearance are consistent with severe population reduction.&#160;<span>In Venezuela, this species is rare and subjected to intense fishing pressure with no monitoring in place, and it is suspected that a significant reduction in population size has occurred there. In the Guianas, there are no data but intense artisanal and commercial fisheries are suspected to have caused a population reduction there. Fisheries are especially intense in northern Brazil, and a population reduction there is suspected to have been occurring since the 1990s. In northwest Brazil, the combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several other larger elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

Generation length is suspected to be similar to that of the related Whitedotted Skate (<em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 10 years, a maximum age of 17 years, and thus a generation length of 13.5 years (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2005).","The Bignose Fanskate is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal trawl fisheries, which are intensive throughout its range (Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2011, Port <em>et al. </em>2016).

In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and  increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em>   2006). Furthermore, this skate is targeted in unmanaged artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries in Uruguay and Argentina (Llompart <em>et al. </em>2017, Laporta<em> et al. </em>2018). Lastly, they are targeted in unmanaged recreational fisheries in Argentina (Llompart <em>et al. </em>2017). All of these fisheries are intense and lack adequate management   measures, and this skate does not have any refuge at depth.","In southern Brazil, this species has undergone a notable decline in size-at-maturity in Rio Grande do Sul, possibly due to fishing mortality (Basallo and Oddone 2014), and analyses of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in research trawl data indicate a decline in biomass of 74.5% between 1974 and 2005 (Ferreira <em>et al.</em> 2010), equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;83% if scaled over three generations (40.5 years). In the Uruguayan fisheries statistics of the coastal industrial trawler fleet, this species is included in the generic category 'skates' which refers mostly to the Smallnose Fanskate (<em>Sympterygia bonapartii</em>), therefore, there are no specific data for the Bignose Fanskate from that fishery. This species was found with low occurrence and low abundance in Uruguayan research trawl surveys carried out in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ). In 794 research trawls between 2010 and 2016, this skate was recorded in 190 hauls (Paesch 2018). However, this species was formerly a target of the longline fishery in Uruguay, but now it is uncommonly captured suggesting the species is severely depleted. Further, in Argentina,&#160;total skate landings have peaked and are declining as a result of overfishing.&#160;In Argentina, reported landings of skates in general increased from 900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and then declined to 24,000 t in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y Pesca 2010, cited in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). The patterns in these reported landings data are not species-specific, but they do suggest a substantial increase in fishing pressure over the past several decades, and the more recent decline in landings may represent a population reduction (although this needs to be confirmed with estimates of standardized CPUE and/or fisheries-independent research). Overall, due to intense and inadequately managed trawl fisheries that operate throughout its range, possible signs of overfishing in this species, and declines in several indices of abundance, it is suspected that the Bignose Fanskate has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (40.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Bignose Fanskate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to Bah<span class=""st"">ía Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","This skate is taken as a utilized bycatch where caught, and is consumed or sold locally or exported to Asia.

In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Vessels often practice 'pair-trawling', where multiple boats link up to  increase the area swept, and this species is captured in this fishery  (Rotundo<em> et al.</em> 2009). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). From the late 1990s,  deep-water fisheries along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil  developed to remove some pressure from depleted coastal resources  (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). Four main fisheries (hook and line, benthic  gillnet, pots, and benthic trawls) targeted a variety of species  including monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>), Argentine Hake  (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>), and deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae) at depths  of 200–1,000 m. Foreign vessels also operated in the region until  2002, fishing at depths predominately &gt;500 m (Perez <em>et al. </em>2009). Development of these fisheries was intense; the entire area fished  for deep-water shrimp was estimated to be swept nearly twice  over a three year period (2003–2006), reducing biomass estimates of the  target Scarlet Shrimp (<em>Aristaeopsis edwardsiana</em>) by up to 50% (Dallagnolo <em>et  al.</em> 2009). This ray was among the most vulnerable to capture in this fishery in a productivity-susceptibility analysis (Visintin and Perez 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet increased from 46 vessels in 1975 to a peak of 121 in 2004, followed by a decline to 81 vessels in 2010. During the expansion phase of this fishery, landings increased six-fold from 1975 to 1981. Subsequent depletion of these species led to a diversification of the fisheries into non-traditional (i.e. bycatch) species, masking the decline in previous target species (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997 the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). This is thought to be an underestimate, as many artisanal vessels are not registered. In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet almost doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). Although this ray is thought to be discarded when caught, post-release mortality is unknown and is suspected to be high.

In the Pacific, records have become increasingly rare and this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Records are sparse from elsewhere in Pacific Mexico and Central America and occur rarely in Colombia and Ecuador. The Atlantic South American portion of the population has also been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this species is considered rare. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records in Bahia state;&#160;records of sphyrnid sharks there have been declining in number since the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely. There are no recent records from southern Brazil. Overall, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, as well as the degradation of mangrove habitats, and has undergone range retractions in some areas. There have been very few recent records and it is inferred that the Scoophead Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Scoophead Shark inhabits waters over continental shelves from inshore to 100 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL); females mature at 100–133 cm TL and males at 90–100 cm TL; reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to young that are 34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be about 12 years, based on available data for the congeneric Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum recorded age of 18 years (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014).","The Scoophead Shark is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries. This hammerhead is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, it has no refuge at depth, and it has been depleted in several areas. <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that   often target sharks have been operating for many decades in   the Gulf of California, Mexico, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and   other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Unmanaged artisanal fisheries   targeting sharks including this species have been  operating  around   Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965), although there is a three-month seasonal ban on the take of sharks that has been in place since 2012. Further south in this  portion of the  species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists  with little  management in place, and there are commercial  longline and  trawl fisheries off many areas of Pacific Central and  South America. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In the Atlantic part of its range, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,   and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas. Caribbean Colombia is dominated by artisanal fisheries  and there were an estimated 14,000 artisanal fishers on the Colombian  coast in the Caribbean in 2006 (Wielgus <em>et al</em>. 2010). Since  1995, fishers there have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition  of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent  increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating  at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and  expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). These fisheries are known to catch the congener Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>) (Acevedo <em>et al.</em>  2007) and are likely to also capture this species. Effort in this  fishery peaked in 1990 and declined substantially until the early 2000s (<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">García <em>et al. </em>2007).  Furthermore, lack of enforcement capacity has led to illegal fishing by  Honduran and Nicaraguan vessels in Colombian waters (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>  2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense,  lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed  by  declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).  Groundfish fisheries on  the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015). Gillnets and  artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of  Brazil's coast, other Sphyrnids are captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2014), and this species is also likely to be caught. <span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In  northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of  target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s  (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and  unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the  disappearance of several other elasmobranch species in the region  (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016). In  northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense,  gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that  stocks are over-exploited, and other sharks have been depleted including congeners  (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014).  In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).  Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being  collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). Overall, this shark is subject to intense, largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, and it has no refuge at depth. <br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","There is evidence of population reduction in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. In the Eastern Central Pacific, this shark was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and off the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernández-Carvallo 1967). Records became increasingly rare from the 1980s onwards, and it is no longer present in the Gulf of California; there were only three records from Mexico in the two decades leading up to 2014, all of which were restricted to southern Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017). Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014, J.-C. Pérez-Jiménez unpubl. data 2018). This shark has not been encountered in Pacific Central America since the 1980s; there are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna </em>species (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). To summarize the situation in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.<br/><br/>The Atlantic South American portion of the population has been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark has been very rarely reported (Grijalba <em>et al</em>. 2009, García and Armenteras 2015), and is thought to never have been common. In Venezuela, it is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone population reduction there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across the Guianas. In Brazil, intense fishing pressure is suspected to have led to a population reduction. Many elasmobranchs are at high risk of extinction in the north of Brazil, and it is suspected that this species has also been overfished there. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state; records of sphyrnid sharks there became increasingly rare during the 1990s, and since 2000 have only occurred very rarely (Reis-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2014). To summarize the situation in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).<br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Scoophead Shark occurred historically in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico to northern Peru and in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to southern Brazil (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

Although other larger congenerics are preferred in trade, it is likely that this species also enters the international market, as demand for smaller fins is increasing (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2019). The meat is likely consumed or sold locally, but may also be exported to Brazil where demand is rising (Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific  protections or conservation measures in  place for the Scoophead Shark outside of Brazil.  In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing   from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.   Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). In Brazil, it is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the    Environment Nº 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species    listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National    Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Gadig <em>et al. </em>2018). This legislation came into   force  in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015   and the  first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry   (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017).  The ordinance faces increasing industry   pressure, including a current court  challenge to suspend the legislation   again by the Secretaria Nacional  de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who   brought forward their contention that  the Brazilian National Red List   was designed specifically for  terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate. Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory and up to 5% in the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening&#160;compliance (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on life history, population size and trends, and threats. To conserve populations and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest&#160; management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement.","",,false,false,Global

over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015). There are artisanal fisheries that partially target sharks in Guyana with gillnets and demersal longlines. There were ~600 artisanal vessels there in 1998, and these fisheries do capture this shark (Kolmann <em>et al.</em> 2017). <span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text

were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s  (Vasconcellos   2011). The combination of intense and  unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the  disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including  Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em><span class=""text surname"">) and Daggernose Shark (</span><em></em><em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em><span class=""text surname"">) (Reis-Filho 2016, Lessa   2016), and this species is known to be caught and traded there despite legal protection (Feitosa&#160;<em> </em><em>et al.</em><em></em><em></em><em> </em><span class=""text surname"">2018).</span><span class=""text

There are few data on population reduction but there are intensive unmanaged fisheries that are suspected to have caused reductions and possibly local extinctions throughout this species' range. There are no data from Colombia, Venezuela or the Guianas, but this species is rarely recorded and intense unmanaged artisanal fishing pressure there is suspected to have caused population reduction. In Trinidad and Tobago, this species had already undergone a notable decline in landings in the inshore artisanal fishery there prior to 2006 (Shing 2006). In Brazil, this hammerhead has not been recorded in 35 years from Ceará state (V. Faria unpubl. data 2018), and this species is considered by local fishers to be depleted in the state of Bahia (Giglio <em>et al.</em> 2015, Giglio and Bornatowski 2016). There are intense and unmanaged artisanal fisheries in southern Brazil, which are suspected to have reduced the population substantially. There are no data for this species from Uruguay and Argentina, but there are important artisanal fisheries that are likely to be capturing this species and leading to a population reduction in the absence of management measures. Overall, due to intense and inadequately managed fisheries across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, noted declines in many areas and a lack of records in others, and its relatively unproductive life history, it is suspected that the Smalleye Hammerhead has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (37 years).<em></em>",Decreasing,"The Smalleye Hammerhead occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Colombia to the Rio de La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013, Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019). Historical records from the Mediterranean (Tortonese 1951, McEachran and Séret 1987) are erroneous and refer to specimens of the Scalloped Hammerhead (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>).","Hammerheads are among the main shark species in the fin trade and are  among the preferred species for shark fin soup. Although other larger  congeners are preferred in trade, it is likely that this species also  enters the international market, as demand for smaller fins is  increasing (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2019).

It inhabits the continental shelf and estuaries at depths of 2–195 m. It is captured in intense and largely unregulated commercial and artisanal demersal trawl, gillnet, and beach seine fisheries throughout its geographic range. On the southern Brazilian shelf, catches of adults in research trawl surveys declined by 90% between 1972 and 2002, equivalent to a population reduction of 88% over three generation lengths (28 years). In Uruguay, landings peaked at over 3,200 t in 1999 and have declined steadily since. This fishery was considered over-exploited by 2006.&#160;Similar levels of unmanaged exploitation are suspected to be leading to declines in Argentina. This species has a similar geographic and depth distribution to the Critically Endangered Striped Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus fasciatus</em>). Overall, due to the intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure it is exposed to throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, and documented declines, it is suspected that the Narrownose Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (28 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Narrownose Smoothhound inhabits the continental shelf and estuaries at depths of 2–195 m (Weigmann 2016, Molina <em>et al.</em> 2017). It reaches a maximum size of 109 cm total length (TL); females mature at 45–72 cm TL or 7.6 years and males at 49–59 cm TL or 6.8 years (Oddone <em>et al. </em>2005, Segura and Milessi 2009, Molina <em>et al.</em> 2017). Reproduction is viviparous, and females give birth to 1–10 pups after a gestation period of 11–12 months (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is 9.3 years and maximum age is 11 years (Molina <em>et al.</em> 2017), and this species has a natural intrinsic rate of population growth of 0.175 (Cortés 2007). There are known nursery areas in Bahía Engaño and the Ría Deseado estuary, Argentina (Chiaramonte and Pettovelo 2000, Van der Molen and Caille 2001).","The Narrownose Smoothhound is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal  trawl, gillnet, and beach seine fisheries, which are intense across its  range. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and  entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in  over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em>  2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks  targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those  being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late  1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997, the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo<em> et al.</em> 2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as many artisanal vessels are not registered. This shark is highly commercialized there and is targeted in these fisheries (Segura and Milessi 2009, Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became  industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly  in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2006). By 1992 there were over 300  coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the  number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from  over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of  fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in  1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación  Pesquera 2016). This shark has long been targeted and caught as bycatch there and this practice continues with little management (Chiaramonte 1998, Van der Molen <em>et al.</em> 1998, De Wysiecki <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overall, this houndshark is subjected to intense fishing pressure across  its range that is inadequately managed, and it has no refuge at depth.  Other smoothhounds that are fished are often able to withstand  well-managed fishing pressure, however in other areas that lack  management their stocks have collapsed (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Colloca<em> et al. </em>2017).","Inferences of population trend have been drawn from one estimate of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from research trawl surveys from the southern Brazil Shelf, and declines in landings in Uruguay.&#160;First, on the southern Brazil shelf, research trawl cruises documented a 90% reduction in the catches of adults between 1972 and 2002 (Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2010), equivalent to an 88% reduction over three generations. Second, in Uruguay, landings peaked at over 3,200 t in 1999 and have declined steadily since (Casselberry and Carlson 2015). This fishery was considered over-exploited by 2006 as a result of intensive fishing pressure (Defeo<em> et al. </em>2009). Overall, due to the intense and unmanaged fishing pressure that this species is exposed to across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its relatively unproductive life history, and documented declines in several areas in its restricted range, it is suspected that the Narrownose Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (28 years).",Decreasing,"The Narrownose Smoothhound occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to south of Puerto Deseado, Santa Cruz, Argentina (Oddone <em>et al. </em>2005).","This houndshark is intensely exploited throughout its range for meat (Segura and Milessi 2009). Demand is increasing in Brazil, where shark meat is sold as <em>cação, </em>and consumers have little knowledge that they are consuming sharks (Bornatowski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Brazil is now one of the major importers of shark meat (Dent and Clarke 2015), and this species is likely included.",Marine,"This houndshark is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the  Environment No. 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species  listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National  Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Vooren <em>et al. </em>2018).

3094144,60218,Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 160 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Trinidad and Tobago and eastern Venezuela to Maranhão State, Brazil. It inhabits inshore waters in turbid estuaries, river mouths, and shallow banks at depths of 4–40 m. This species is targeted, along with other sharks, and/or caught as bycatch in intense and largely unregulated artisanal and commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries. Gillnet and trawl fishing effort is intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America with general patterns of decline and sequential overfishing. In northwest Brazil, the decline of this species is well-documented, with the species commonly landed in the 1980s and subsequently becoming increasingly rare to the point where single records are noteworthy. There are very few recent records, with most recent record a neonate captured in 2016. Demographic analysis revealed a population decline of 18.4% per year between 1992 and 2002, equivalent to a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations. Overall, due to the intense and unmanaged fishing pressure that this species is exposed to, its slow life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to overfishing, inferred and estimated declines, the paucity of recent records, and ongoing habitat degradation, it is inferred that the Daggernose Shark&#160;has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (27 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Daggernose Shark inhabits inshore waters in turbid estuaries, river mouths, and shallow banks at depths of 4–40 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013), and has also been recently recorded in freshwater (Feitosa <em>et al. </em>2019). It reaches a maximum size of 160 cm total length (TL); females mature at 115 cm TL (6–7 years old) and males at 103 cm TL (5–6 years old) (Lessa<em> et al. </em>2000). Reproduction is placental viviparous, and females give birth to 3–8 pups that are 43 cm TL at birth (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2000, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Young are born at the beginning of the rainy season after a one-year gestation, and females are thought to exhibit a two-year reproductive cycle (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2000). Maximum age is at least 12 years (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2000), and generation length is estimated to be 9 years. This shark migrates offshore during the rainy season and inshore during the dry season (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The Daggernose Shark is targeted along with other sharks, and/or caught as bycatch in artisanal and commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and gillnets are a primary gear in most areas. In Trinidad and Tobago, artisanal gillnet fisheries are intense and have been in operation since at least the 1960s, and there were around 400 vessels operating in the early 1990s; the government there led an initiative with the help of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to develop the shark fishery in 1983 (Shing 1994). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). There are no data from the Guianas but artisanal fisheries are widespread and suspected to be intense. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth<em> et al.</em> 2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including this species and the Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) (<em></em>Lessa<em> et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016). Demographic analysis indicates that this shark has an extremely low resilience to fishing pressure. The decline of this species is well-documented in northwestern Brazil, with the species having  been commonly encountered in landings in the 1980s and becoming  increasingly rare up to the present. Furthermore, this shark faces threats to its habitat including mangrove deforestation for aquaculture and coastal development and pollution from the increasing human population in the region (Magris and Barreto 2015).","In Trinidad and Tobago, annual shark landings between 1972 and 1993 were variable but showed a general pattern of decline over time (Shing 1994), which is suspected to have continued to the present day. In eastern Venezuela, landings are typically not recorded to species level but artisanal fisheries are intense and it is suspected that declines have occurred there; the situation is suspected to be similar in the Guianas. In northwestern Brazil, the decline of this species is well-documented, with the species having been commonly encountered in landings in the 1980s and becoming increasingly rare up to the present (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016). Although the species is still present there (a neonate was captured in late 2016) (Feitosa <em>et al. </em>2019), the rarity of recent records leads to inference of a drastic population reduction. Furthermore, demographic analysis revealed that between 1992 and 2002 the population decreased at an average rate of 18.4% per year (Santana and Lessa  2002), which is equivalent to a &gt;99% population reduciton if scaled over three generations. Overall, due to the intense and unmanaged fishing pressure that this species is exposed to, its slow life history characteristics that make it particularly susceptible to overfishing, the observed ongoing declines in landings since the 1980s, the rarity of recent records, and ongoing habitat degradation and loss, it is inferred that the Daggernose Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (27 years).",Decreasing,"The Daggernose Shark occurs in the Western Central and Southwest  Atlantic from Trinidad and Tobago and eastern Venezuela to Maranhão  State, Brazil (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016).","This species' fins and meat are not of high quality, and therefore the meat is only likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold      locally in most places.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In Brazil, this shark has been protected on paper since it was assessed nationally as 'threatened' 2004 (IN 05 of 21/5/2004 (MMA/SEAP).

There are no known protections or conservation measures in place for the Daggernose Shark in any of its other range states.

Due to the intense and largely unmanaged nature of fisheries in the region, the decreasing probability of catches, documented declines in some areas, and the relative lack of recent records in many parts of its range, combined with alarming declines in other elasmobranchs in the core of its range (northern South America), it is inferred that the Smalltail Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years).&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Smalltail Shark historically occurred in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from the central, western and southern Gulf of Mexico and along the Caribbean coast of Central and South America to the state of Paraná in southern Brazil, not including the Caribbean Islands&#160;(Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","In general, requiem sharks in general are fished and valued for their meat, liver oil, and fins (Ebert <em>et al.</em>    2013), and this species is likely to be used similarly where it is    fished.

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 133–550 m. It is captured in intensive and largely unmanaged commercial deep-water demersal gillnet and trawl fisheries throughout its very small geographic range. This skate is landed as utilized bycatch and the meat is suspected to  be sold locally, and may enter the international trade which is increasing due to demand from Asian markets. There are two lines of evidence for population reduction: (1) perceptions of changed size composition and abundance in fisheries; and, (2) declines in landings of larger rays despite increasing effort. First, catches of adults are now rare and most individuals caught are juveniles, although adults were formerly commonly seen by observers.&#160;Second, trawl landings data for large rays &gt;90 cm total length from the Southwest Atlantic show a sharp increase in the 1990s and 2000s, from less than 1,000 t to a peak of nearly 4,000 t in 2007. Landings then declined to 1,000–1,500 t between 2008 and 2013 despite increased effort<em></em>.&#160;Although these reported landings  data are not  species-specific,  they do suggest a substantial increase  in fishing  pressure over the  past several decades, and the recent  decline in landings may be indicative of a population reduction. Overall, due to its very small geographic distribution that provides no refuge from intense and largely unmanaged fisheries, high local and international demand for meat, and its large  size and presumed low productivity that are likely to make it  particularly sensitive to fishing pressure, it is suspected that Menni's Skate has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the  past three generation lengths (34.5 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","Menni's Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 133–550 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 167 cm total length (TL); size-at-maturity is unknown but males of 95 cm TL are immature. Generation length is suspected to be ~11.5 years, similar to that of the congeneric Slime Skate (<em>Dipturus pullopunctatus</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and a maximum age of 14 years (Walmsley-Hart <em>et al. </em>1999).","Menni's Skate is captured in commercial deep-water demersal gillnets and trawls, which are intense across its small range. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2019). Deep-water fisheries such as the gillnet fishery targeting monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>) began in the late 1990s and were considered to be over-exploited there already by the late 2000s due to governance limitations (Perez<em> et al.</em> 2009), and this skate is one of the dominant bycatch species in catches (Perez<em> et al. </em>2005). Overall, Menni's Skate is subjected to intense fishing pressure across its narrow range, it has no refuge at depth, and its large size is likely to make it very sensitive to fishing pressure as has been noted for other large skates (Dulvy and Reynolds 2002).","Inferences on population trend have been drawn from two types of information: (1) perceptions of changed size composition and abundance in fisheries; and, (2) declines in landings of larger rays despite increasing effort. First, catches of adults are now rare and most individuals caught are  juveniles, although adults were formerly commonly seen by observers (G. Rincon unpub. data 2018). Second, trawl landings data for large rays &gt;90 cm total length from the  Southwest Atlantic show a sharp increase in the 1990s and 2000s, from   less than 1,000 t to a peak of nearly 4,000 t in 2007.

Although these reported landings  data are not  species-specific, they do suggest a substantial increase  in fishing  pressure over the past several decades, and the recent  decline in landings may be indicative of a population reduction. Overall, due to the intense nature of commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries in the area, this species' narrow distribution that provides no refuge from fishing, declines in indices of abundance, and its large size and presumed low productivity that are likely to make it particularly sensitive to overfishing, it is suspected that Menni's Skate has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (34.5 years).",Decreasing,"Menni's Skate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Espírito Santo state to Santa Catarina state, Brazil (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, G.

3186676,10268,Huso dauricus,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The species has undergone a sharp decline in both stock and recruitment. The dramatic stock decline began in the late 19th century and continues to the present day. From the late 19th century to 1992 the population has experienced a decline of more than 80%. During the last ten to fifteen years a very large decrease in the abundance of this species has occurred. The average age of fishes is subsequently decreasing as a result of catch of adults by poachers for caviar. This has resulted in females reproducing only once in their lifetime. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.,"Habitat: All types of benthic habitats in large rivers and lakes of the Amur River basin. <br/><br/>Biology: Semi-anadromous (anadromous fishes spend at least part of their life in salt water and return to rivers to breed). The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the main stream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom. Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4-5 years in females and 3-4 years in males. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Berg 1948).","The causes of the population decline are still overfishing, both legal and poaching (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Recently, environmental pollution in the Amur River basin threatens the habitat and reproduction of this species (Shmigirilov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Chen 2007).","Currently, complete population data based on results of direct counts and fishery statistics do not exist for this species. A decline of catches has been observed since the end of the 19th century (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Towards the end of the 19th century, annual catch was approximately 500 tonnes. Before 1992 the annual catch was 92 tonnes. This indicates a greater than 80% decline in catches over 90 years (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007).<br/><br/>A hatchery is located in Luchegorsk at Khabarovsk district which contains a living collection of eight species of sturgeons (including the Kaluga Sturgeon) and hybrids. In 2007, this hatchery attempted the first re-stocking of juveniles of this this species into the Amur River.",Decreasing,"The Kaluga Sturgeon inhabits the entire Amur River basin from the estuary to the river’s upper reaches. It occurs in tributaries - the Shilka, Onon, Argun, Nerch, Sungari, Nonni and Ussuri and Neijiang Rivers (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997). It rarely occurs in Lake Khanka. Young specimens also appear in the coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, near the northeastern part of the Tatar Strait, and in the Sea of Japan near the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Shmigirilov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007).

3187455,10269,Huso huso,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species was historically known from the Caspian, Black, Azov and Adriatic Sea basins. It has been extirpated from the Adriatic (in the early 1970s, Gessner pers. comm.) and Azov Seas due to overfishing and loss of spawning sites due to dams. As the species is very long lived, individuals can still be caught in areas where their spawning sites have been cut off. The last wild population in the Black Sea basin migrates up the Danube river. All other Black Sea stocks are almost extirpated due to overfishing and impoundment of spawning rivers. In the Caspian basin, the last wild population migrates up the River Ural. The Volga population depends on stocking as the construction of Volgograd dam led to the loss of almost all of the species spawning sites in the river. Most of the few recorded females are in their first year of maturation. Based on catch data, and number of recorded spawning individuals it is estimated that the species has seen a wild native population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (a minimum of 60 years) and overfishing for meat and caviar will soon cause global extinction of the remaining natural wild populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.","At sea, this species is found in the pelagic zone, following food organisms. It migrates further upriver to spawn than any other sturgeon; however this migration has now been disrupted due to river regulation (in the Danube drainage up to Morava River). It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. <br/><br/>This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 10-15 years, females at 15-18 years, with an estimated generation length of 20-25 years. This species spawns every 3-4 years in April-June. A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes one peak in late winter and spring and one in late summer and autumn. In spring, it migrates from the sea before spawning. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the rivers until the following spring. Spawning occurs at temperature from 6 to 14 °C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at a current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. Spawners the late winter/spring run dominate the spawners in the Volga River (80%), whereas the late summer/autumn&#160; run dominates in the Ural River. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 7-8 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. <br/><br/>In the past this species was the largest fish of the Caspian Sea, reaching lengths of more than 5 m and a weight of 1,000 kg. The lifetime of such large specimens, apparently, exceeded 100 years. Currently there are individuals up to 280 cm, weighing up to 650 kg. Average length of females is 240, males is 220 cm, weight respectively is 130 and 65 kg. The maximum age of 53 years was observed in 2003. <br/>&#160;<br/>Various environmental factors influence the distribution of the species in the Caspian Sea. One factor is water temperature, as mature Beluga prefer water temperatures not exceeding 30°C. They spend the spring and summer mostly in the northern and middle parts of the Caspian Sea and then move southwards to spend the winter in the southern areas, which coincides with highest densities of food organisms. The diet includes roach <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rutilus rutilus</span> (L.), common carp (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cyprinus carpio</span>&#160;L.), herrings (Clupeidae), kilka (Clupeonella), crayfish (Astacus), gobies (Gobiidae), pike-perch (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sander lucioperca</span> (L.)), birds, sturgeons (Acipenseridae), and even seal (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>., 1995). Mature individuals of Beluga are less sensitive to low temperature than the immature, as they feed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea under the ice. With water temperatures decreasing, Belugas reduce the range of depths at which they feed. Immature individuals in spring and autumn prefer the more desalinated sea areas. In summer the highest concentrations occur at the salinity of 3 to 7%. The largest concentrations of Beluga in the northern Caspian occur during the migration of its main prey organisms (herrings, kilka, gobies, roach, etc.).","Overfishing at sea and poaching in estuaries and rivers for meat and caviar is a major threat to the species. Overharvesting and a sharp increase in poaching has led to the largest and most mature specimens being removed from the population and reducing natural reproduction to almost zero (Krassikov and Fedin 1996). In the Ural river current fishing rates are 4 to 5 times sustainable levels (F Max) (Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. accepted). <br/><br/>Bycatch is also a threat to the species. The species caviar is very high value (8,000 USD per kilo in 2009).<br/><br/>Impoundment of rivers has destroyed most of the species spawning grounds. The Volgograd dam, built in 1955, has decreased the area of available spawning grounds by 88-100% in the Volga river, similar areas have been reduced in the Terek and Sulak rivers from 132 ha and 202 ha, respectively. The Don river dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban river led to the loss of 140,000 ha (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Due to the longevity of the species there is evidence of pesticide contamination, leading to many problems including reduced reproductive success (Gessner, J. pers comm.).<br/><br/>The Allee effect could also be a threat to the species.","Global fisheries statistics show that there has been a 93% decline in catch from 1992 (520 tonnes) to 2007 (33 tonnes) (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>The number of Beluga annually entering the Volga dropped from 26,000 (1961-65) to 2,800 (1998-2002), a decline of 89% in 33 years (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Only 2,500 migrated up Ural in 2002 (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). <br/><br/>Currently it is thought that nearly 100% of Beluga in the Volga are hatchery reared, but there is evidence of spawning elsewhere in its distribution (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Despite intensive restocking in the Caspian Sea (91% of each generation is estimated to come from hatchery stock), the annual catch in the northern Caspian Sea has drastically fallen. Catches in the Caspian were: 1945-55 average of 1,380 tonnes; 1956-65 average of 1,283 tonnes; 1966-75 average of 1,623 tonnes; 1976-85 average of 849 tonnes; 1986-95 average of 506 tonnes; 1996-2003 (latest data) average of 60.8 tonnes (in Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> accepted). This shows a decline of 95%. The official catch statistics support this trend, as they show that the species was abundant in 1938 and then stable to the late 1980s, with the major decline starting from 1990 to the present showing over a 90% decline in the past 60 years (see Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The agreed Beluga catch quota for all of the Caspian Sea (2007/8 - 28th session of the Commission) was 99.8 tonnes; this quota was not achieved. The proportion of Beluga (to other sturgeon species) in trawl catches of the northern Caspian Sea in all seasons of observations was at an average of 11%. Over the recent years, this percentage has decreased to 8.3%, and the catch of beluga during trawl surveys did not exceed 31 specimens per year&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Spawning numbers for the Volga from 1961-65 was 26,000, whilst in 1996/1997 it was 1,800 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000), with 2,800 in 1998-2002 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>In the Sea of Azov, between 1979-1981 it is estimated that 551,000 individuals existed (from stocked, and dominated by sub-adult and juveniles); in 1988-1993 there were 25,000 and after 1994 they were only caught sporadically, despite banning of commercial fishing of Beluga in 1986. After 1986 the major threat was from bycatch. Since 1994, 98% of individuals recorded in the Azov Sea have been juvenile. In 2001 the first individuals were produced from captive bred individuals and released (Chebanov and Koziritskaya 2007).<br/><br/>Catches in the Danube have also declined. In the mid-Danube the annual catch was 23 tonnes (average between 1972-76) which dropped to 7.5 tonnes (average between 1985-89), a decline of 67% in around 12 years (CITES 2000). In 2002, 21.3 tonnes were caught in Romania, whilst only 8.4 tonnes were caught in 2005, showing a 60% decline in three years. The percentage of catch quota achieved in Romania was 85% in 2002, 84% in 2003, 46% in 2004, and 34% in 2005. In 2006 the catching of Beluga was banned in the Danube (Paraschiv <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Azov, and Adriatic Seas, however its current native wild distribution is restricted to the Black Sea (in the Danube only) and the Caspian Sea (in the Ural only). It is one of the largest anadromous fish in the Caspian Sea, where at least three Beluga populations have been identified by microsatellite technique (Pourkazemi 2008). It does occur in the Azov Sea, and Volga River but these are stocked fish.",This species is targeted for its skin and as a leather. Caviar is also used as cosmetic and medicinal purposes.

Restocking programmes are ongoing. However the programmes do not compensate for the loss of natural reproduction and the populations continue to decline (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>The annual number of fingerlings released into the Volga show 0.4 million in 1951; 13.1 million between 1966-70 (average per year); 19.4 million between 1981-85; 11.3 million between 1996-2000; and 3 million between 2001-2005 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The Report of the 28th Session of Caspian Bioresource Commission states that the total fingerling release of beluga in 2008 was 7.02 million from Russia, Iran and Khazakstan. <br/><br/>Some natural reproduction of the species remains in the Volga and Ural Rivers. However, at present the abundance of Beluga is extremely low. Since 2000 in Russia, it has only been caught for the purposes of reproduction (for hatcheries) and science. The protective measures at the feeding grounds are necessary to maintain the population of beluga, as well as the preservation of natural spawning and juveniles breeding at hatcheries.<br/><br/>In the Danube the release of recruitment size (over 15 cm long) from Romania into the Danube has risen from 12,500 in 2006, to 15,130 in 2007 and 20,000 in 2008 (Suciu pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Iran, in work with the World Bank, are increasing the rate of release of Beluga; in 2003, 6,000 individuals (CWT tagged and visible tagged) were released. The size of the released individuals has been increased from 3-5 g to 10-25 g to increase survival rates (Pourali <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hatchery experts (which are state owned) are given financial incentives upon the delivery of individuals ready to be released. Iran has also developed beluga farming to supply meat and caviar production to minimize the impact to the wild population (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species is not fully protected in any range state, though fishing licences are required in most countries and Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries. Overall however, enforcement measures seem to be lacking. In 1996, fishing in the open sea for the species was banned through an agreement between the countries bordering the Caspian Sea. Artificial spawning grounds have been attempted below Volgograd dam, which has shown some success (Ruban pers. comm.).

This assessment presents additional information to support that assessment. The American Fisheries Society classified the species as Threatened (Musick <em>et al</em>. 2000). <br/> <br/>Pre-exploitation biomass for Southern California populations of the Giant Sea Bass was estimated to be 1,300 tons (1,179 tonnes) (Ragen 1991). The fish was so heavily exploited in both California and Mexican waters that the commercial landings declined rapidly from 115 tonnes in 1932 to 5 tonnes in 1980 in California waters, whereas it decreased greatly from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters over the same period (Domeier 2001). The annual landings (in tonnes) of the species in California fluctuated in the 1990s: 3.3 (1990), 5.3 (1991), 3.9 (1992), 2.1 (1993), 0.4 (1994), 0.5 (1995), 0.9 (1996), 1.1 (1997), 2.9 (1998), 2.4 (1999), 2.0 (2000) and 2.6 (2001) (NMFS 2003).

Ikehara pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Currently, it is suggested that the population size of Giant Sea Bass in California may be increasing as it is under protection (Domeier 2001); however, there are no hard data to support it. Due to the heavy harvest in Mexico and the long generation time (estimated at 7–10 years) (Domeier 2001). It is also possible that the species may need  additional protection in Mexico but more information is needed.

Determined using RAMAS Red List software. We used the software default settings for dispute tolerance and risk tolerance. <br/> <br/>The IUCN criteria used to estimate the population size reduction for a species can include the following: direct observations, indices of abundance, declines in area of occupancy or extent of occurrence and/or quality of the habitat, actual or potential levels of exploitation, or effects of introduced taxa, hybridization, pathogens, pollutants, competitors or parasites.  We relied on four primary sources of information to document declines in population abundance (in Russia) and habitat (in Japan).  Below we include documentation of our data sources and our analytical approaches: <br/> <br/>1. Khabarovsk bycatch time series <br/> <br/>We obtained data on bycatch of Sakhalin taimen in commercial fisheries (primarily gill net captures) along the Sea of Japan coast in Khabarovsk during 1951–1998.  These data have been reported in a number of publications (Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000, Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Data are reported as weight (in 1,000 kg) of landed biomass of taimen (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material).  We parsed the data into three discrete periods to account for different prevailing social and economic conditions for the fishery.  We identified the first period (1951–1964) as the most reliable time series, where bycatch reporting rate was high and consistent.  We fit a exponential model to these data and estimated a rate of decline of the regional population at -9% yr<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming an average weight of captured taimen at 5 kg, the total harvest during this period ranged from ~800 to ~4,000 individuals yr<sup>-1</sup>, most likely representing the peak bycatch fishery yield for the species in this region.  We fit an exponential model to a second time series that extended from 1972–1979, a period marked by a growing black market for the species, resulting in under-reported bycatch.  The rate of decline during this period was estimated at -23% yr<sup>-1</sup>.  We fit the remaining data in the time series (1980–1998) to a separate exponential model.  This period can be characterized by continued under-reporting of bycatch, and includes recreational landings beginning in the mid-1990s.  The model fit to these data suggested the regional population declined by -12% yr<sup>-1</sup>.   <br/> <br/>2. Sakhalin bycatch time series <br/> <br/>We obtained data on bycatch of Sakhalin taimen in the commercial fishery located in the Nogliki region of Sakhalin Island during 1971–1997.  These data were compiled by SakhNIRO, the regional fisheries agency on Sakhalin.  Data are reported as weight (in 100 kg) of landed biomass of taimen (see Figure 3 in the Supplementary Material).  Assuming an average weight for captured taimen at 5 kg, peak harvest during this time series was ~ 3,000 individuals yr<sup>-1</sup>, occurring in 1974.  We fit these data to an exponential model, and estimated the slope of the regression of log(catch) vs. year.  This time series suggests a rate of reduction of the population of 11% yr<sup>-1</sup> over the period of record (26 yr).  The rate of decline of the older members of the population in the region is thought to be even more dramatic (S.N. Safronov, Sakhalin State University, pers. comm.).   <br/> <br/>3. Estimate of exploitation rate on the Koppi River population <br/> <br/>Catch and age composition data from the Koppi River population was obtained during 2000-2002.  Gill nets and angling were the primary methods of capture.  Captured individuals were aged by scale analysis (N = 131).  We fit a regression of log (catch) vs. age for individuals aged 3-16 to estimate Z, total instantaneous mortality rate of the population (see Figure 4 in the Supplementary Material).  This assumes that taimen are fully recruited to the fishing gear by age 3, and that the age composition of the catch is representative of the true population in the river.  Our estimate for Z is 0.307 (or -26 % yr<sup>-1</sup>).  Assuming natural mortality (M) to be 0.11 (see above), we estimated fishing mortality by difference (F = Z - M, F = 0.197).  The resulting value for fishing mortality is ~ two times the rate of natural mortality of the population.  Annual rate of fishing mortality is estimated at -18% yr<sup>-1</sup>.  This mortality rate is within the range of estimated population loss rates based on the bycatch time series for Khabarovsk estimated above (-9, -12, and -23% yr<sup>-1</sup>). While this may be an overestimate of fishing mortality based on difficulties associated with sampling older, mature individuals in the Koppi River population, it does represent the most comprehensive effort to date to provide a reliable sample of the age composition and relative abundance of a river population of Sakhalin taimen.  <br/> <br/>4. Hokkaido taimen fry survey <br/> <br/>Trend data for the species abundance in Hokkaido, Japan are not available.  A comparison of results from redd surveys conducted during 1991 and 1998 in the Sarufutsu River in northern Hokkaido indicated no marked changes over time in spawner abundance for this population (M. Fukushima, JMOE unpubl. data).  We feel that that this data set is not representative given the short period of observation, and that the region has seen much less change in land use compared to other regions in Hokkaido.  Here we rely on a study on presence/absence for the species in Hokkaido to scale the magnitude of habitat loss for the species.  Edo (2001) concluded that the range of the species has been reduced by 57% based on an extensive survey of juvenile taimen (fry, or young-of-the-year) during 2000.  The survey involved electrofishing reaches in a total of 30 study streams that were thought to support the species historically (Edo 2001).  Fry were observed in a total of 13 study streams, representing 43% of the historic range currently occupied.  We acknowledge the likelihood of error by relying on fry absence based on a one-time survey as evidence of extirpation, but we feel this is the best available data to allow us to gauge habitat loss in this region.  While numerous anecdotes exists for declining adult abundance in some river systems, we lack reliable time series data.  One river, the Shiribetsu (located in southwestern Hokkaido), was recognized historically for it prized receational taimen fishery, but no longer supports adult spawners.  Surveys for redds conducted since 1995 have indicated that this population has been extirpated (H. Kawamura, Hokkaido Fish Hatchery, pers. comm.). <br/> <br/>Based on results of these analyses, and assuming a generation time of 14 yrs, we estimated regional population reductions over three generations (42 yr period) of 98% in Khabarovsk (based on -9% yr<sup>-1</sup> using the most reliable time series), 99% in Sakhalin, and 57% in Hokkaido (based on range reduction using results of fry survey).","Preferred habitat for juvenile Sakhalin taimen is low gradient, coastal rivers (Fukushima 2000), and habitat for maturing and mature adults can extend into first and second order tributaries for spawning and lake and estuarine waters for feeding (Kawamura <em>et al</em>. 1983, Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004).  Females construct redds (i.e. nests) at the lower ends of pools, where eggs are deposited into discrete egg pockets in benthic gravel (Fukushima 1994, Edo <em>et al</em>. 2000).  Data suggests that the density of Sakhalin taimen redds is positively correlated with channel sinuosity (Fukushima 2000).  Some populations on Hokkaido are thought to be restricted to freshwater, possibly related to their position near the southern limit of their range, as has been observed for <em>Salvelinus</em> spp. (e.g., Maekawa and Nakano 2002, Morita <em>et al</em>. 2005).  The species is known to exhibit both freshwater and anadromous life histories.  The species is long lived, slow growing and exhibits delayed age at maturity relative to other salmonids.  The species is iteroparous (i.e. repeat spawns), and reaches sexual maturity at ages 6–8, and achieves peak fecundity at approximately age 15 (Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000).  The species spawns during the spring to early summer, depending on location within their natural range.  Peak spawning occurs during May-June along the Sea of Japan coast (Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000), late June in Sakhalin (Gritsenko <em>et al</em>. 1974), and mid-March to late April in eastern to northern Hokkaido (Kimura 1966, Fukushima 1994).  Anadromous life history forms are thought to reside in estuarine waters during the summer growing season, and overwinter in lower reaches of rivers beginning in mid-September to late October (Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000).  Diet is dominated by benthic invertebrates during years 1–2, followed by a transition to finfish and crustaceans as they mature.  We fit a von Bertalanffy growth model to size at age data for taimen sampled in the following rivers: Kievka and Samarga in Primorye, Russia, Koppi in Khabarovsk, Russia, and several rivers in eastern Hokkaido, Japan.  Data for Kievka and Samarga are obtained from Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. (2000), data from eastern Hokkaido populations are from Yamashiro (1965), and data for the Koppi was obtained from field collections during 2000-2002 (N = 131 individuals, ranging in age from 1 to 16 yr, S. Zolotukhin, TINRO, unpubl. data).  We fit the equation with Microsoft Excel Solver and estimated best fit parameters for the model (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material).  The parameters fit to the Koppi data set, representing our most comprehensive data set on size at age, are as follows: Linf (asymptotic length) = 227 cm TL (TL = total length), K (growth coefficient) = 0.07.  Data in Figure 2 are plotted as FL (fork length, also known as AC in Russia), and values were converted to TL for model fitting using a length conversion equation of TL = 1.032*FL, Froese and Pauly 2005).  Parameters for the other Russian populations were similar to the results for the Koppi.  Growth for taimen in eastern Hokkaido appeared markedly lower than the Russian populations, and may be related to colder water temperatures characteristic of this region (M. Fukushima, pers. comm., see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material).  Growth rates observed for Sakhalin taimen inhabiting a brackish lagoon near the mouth of the Bekanbeushi River in eastern Hokkaido by Kawamura <em>et al</em>. (1983) is relatively low compared to the Russian populations, and is consistent with rates measured by Yamashiro (1965) within the same region.  We compared these growth trajectories qualitatively to size at age based on scale back-calculations for 5 adults from Hokkaido's Shiribetsu River in western Hokkaido (H. Kawamura, Hokkaido Fish Hatchery, unpubl. data).  Although the method used to generate this growth curve is not directly comparable to the methods applied to the other river populations, the general trajectory of growth for Shiribetsu taimen closely approximates growth for the faster growing, Russian populations.  We decided to use the data from the Koppi River as the model for growth dynamics for the species given it is the largest set of data available, while acknowledging that it may not fully represent growth dynamics across the natural range of the species (particularly in eastern Hokkaido, as described above).  Based on the parameter values derived for the Koppi River taimen, and assuming an average annual water temperature in the lower Koppi River of 10° C, we used the model of Pauly (1980) to estimate a rate of natural mortality (M) for the species of 0.11.  We used this estimate of natural mortality to estimate L<sub>opt</sub> (144 cm TL, the length class with the highest biomass for an unfished population) using the model of Beverton (1992).  We then used the estimate of Lopt  and the parameters from the von Bertalanffy growth model in the following formula to estimate generation time: -1.45 - ln(1- L<sub>opt</sub>/L&lt;subinf)/K.  The resulting estimate for generation time was 14 yr.","Overfishing by various sectors (commercial, recreational, and illegal take) is one of the most important threats to this species.  Although Sakhalin taimen are no longer commercially harvested in Russia, they are still targets of legal and illegal subsistence fishing as they are prized for their large size and good flavor (Zolotukhin <em>et al</em>. 2000).  While reporting of taimen bycatch in the commercial pink salmon fishery in Russia has declined in recent years, we feel this is a result of under-reporting and a general decline in region-wide abundance of the species in recent years.  These populations are also under threat from dramatic changes to their habitat expected from planned logging operations.  An expanded logging lease in the Samarga River basin, for example, extends now to 85% of the total watershed area, with construction of roads that could greatly impact many key tributaries.  Rapidly expanding oil and gas development on Sakhalin Island, in particular the laying of pipelines across more than 24 rivers known to support Sakhalin taimen, is posing a growing threat to the species.  In Japan, land development (including river channelization, dam construction, agricultural and urban expansion) represents an important threat to critical habitat for the species.  The threat from poaching in Russia, while hard to quantify, may currently be one of the most significant threats to the species.  During a research trip in 2005, two active poaching camps were discovered, and five dead, adult taimen were recovered that had been captured using illegal fishing gear.  Four of these individuals were mature females carrying as many as 15,000 eggs each (P.S. Rand, WSC unpubl. data).  During spring peak flows, spawners tend to aggregate in side channels off the main stem of the river, and become vulnerable to capture by large mesh gill nets.  Our estimate of fishing mortality in the river, although uncertain given the lack of data, suggests a relatively high rate of exploitation (~ two times the rate of natural mortality).  Sustainable fishing rates on wild fish populations rarely exceed the rate of natural mortality.  FAO (1999) recommends a precautionary approach in data poor fisheries by restricting fishing mortality to below the rate of natural mortality.","Very little data exists on absolute population sizes for this species.  Redd surveys have been conducted in a number of river systems in Hokkaido.  This method is prone to error (see Dunham <em>et al</em>. 2001); however, it is the most commonly used method for enumerating adult abundance in this region.  Estimates of total abundance generated from a redd survey by Edo (2001) for a number of Hokkaido rivers are as follows: Sorachi, 211; Uryu, 264; Bekanbeushi, 306; Toikanbetsu, 422; Kushiro, 21; Tokachi, 21; Shiribetsu, 0.  We used data in Fukushima (1994) to estimate total spawner abundance of 153 individuals within two tributaries (Nino and Jyugo Creeks) of the Sarufutsu River in northwestern Hokkaido (assuming 2 redds per female and a 50:50 sex ratio) based on sampling conducted during 1992.  To generate a Hokkaido-wide population estimate, we divided these population estimates by the total river km for each sampled river segment based on our ArcGIS stream coverage.  This generated an average of 2.7 adult taimen km<sup>-1</sup> (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).  This density was used to estimate spawning abundance in river basins where we lack data.  We excluded those rivers whose populations have been extirpated (Kubo 1990; Harako 1991).  We estimated abundance of the regional population by adding the abundance of taimen in those basins where we have quantitative data to the estimated values of  abundance predicted across the rest of the range by multiplying total river km in each basin by the density estimate of 2.7 taimen km<sup>-1</sup>.  This resulted in a value of 5,068 adults for the Hokkaido population (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). <br/> <br/>We relied on best expert judgment, and consideration of the magnitude of bycatch of taimen in the commercial salmon fishery, to gauge levels of abundance for taimen in the Russian portion of the species range.  Ranges of abundance were provided for 10 rivers along the Sea of Japan coast (1-100,101-1000,1001-10000 adults per basin), and 61 rivers on Sakhalin (1-50, 51-100, 101-1000 adults per basin).  Because ranges were provided in this case, we estimated densities by basin (2.9-29.6 taimen km<sup>-1</sup>, see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) using the low and high value in each abundance strata.  We assumed the density range estimated for Sakhalin applied to the Kuril Islands portion of the species range.  Populations in five basins on Sakhalin Island are presently considered extirpated.  To arrive at a total population for each region, we summed the population estimates (both low and high values in each strata) for the rivers where we had estimates, and extrapolated abundances based on total stream km in basins where we lack data.  Our estimates for total population by region are as follows: Primorye: 2,796-28,323 adults, Khabarovsk: 3,351-33,520 adults, and Sakhalin (including Kuril Islands): 1,591-12,024 (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).  The historic peaks of bycatch landings in the time series (Khabarovsk at ~ 4,000 adults yr<sup>-1</sup> and Sakhalin at ~3,000 adults yr<sup>-1</sup>, estimated by converting landed biomass to adult numbers assuming average weight of landed adult at ~ 5kg) fall within the range of abundances estimated here.",Decreasing,"Russia and Japan (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). Current distribution of Sakhalin taimen extends from approximately 43° N to 53° N latitude and 135° W and 145° W longitude.  The Sakhalin taimen is restricted to the Russian Far East region including Primorye, Khabarovsk, and Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, and in Hokkaido, Japan. <br/> <br/>We conducted a thorough investigation of the natural range of the species through contacts with experts familiar with Sakhalin taimen distribution.  We would particularly like to identify the following individuals for providing input into this process: Dr. Sergei Zolotukhin (TINRO), Dr. Anatoly Semenchenko (TINRO), Mr. Sergei Makeev (Sakhalin Wild Nature Fund), Dr. S. N. Safranov (Sakhalin State University), and Dr. Michio Fukushima (JMOE). <br/> <br/>We relied on the stream network developed in ArcGIS based on the Digital Chart of the World, based on a resolution of 1:1,000,000 (ESRI 1992). We generated a convex polygon that contained all the rivers known to support the species currently.  The estimate of area delineated by this polygon is 332,153 km², excluding marine waters greater than 1 km offshore. We estimated the area of occupancy based on the sum of the individual basin areas that support the species, and marine waters extending 1 km offshore. Our estimate for the area of occupancy is 233,498 km². We assumed in both cases that the area is continuing to decline, but the species does not exhibit extreme fluctuations.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"We feel the following measures need to be taken to stem further losses and allow recovery for the species: <br/> <br/>1. We recommend expanding and/or modifying the network of conservation rivers designated by the government in Hokkaido to provide protection to Sakhalin taimen.  The existing network was established originally for protection of commercial species (e.g. <em>Oncorhynchus masu</em> cherry salmon and <em>O. keta</em> chum salmon), and has been expanded in recent years to protect rare salmonids.  However, a recent effort to identify prime habitat for Sakhalin taimen based on habitat modeling suggests the existing protected area network provides little protection for this species (Fukushima and Kameyama 2006).  We strongly encourage the Hokkaido government to consider extending conservation river protection to the rivers identified by Fukushima and Kameyama (2006), particularly those in the Soya peninsula that still support healthy taimen populations. <br/> <br/>2. We recommend new regulations on recreational fishing, particularly during the spawning season.  While the species has been recognized as endangered (“red book species”) in several regions (Primorye, Sakhalin and Hokkaido), the regulations triggered by these listings are not always sufficient or properly enforced (see #3).  While establishing a ban on fishing is clearly needed in some circumstances, we think establishing exemptions in certain basins would be prudent if there is sufficient evidence that the exploited populations are stable or increasing.  A key virtue of these exemptions is that the presence of recreational fishers, particularly in rivers in remote regions in the Russian part of the species range, could help deter illegal fishing practices.  Where recreational fishing is allowed, we feel there should be a set of regulations enforced, including explicit creel limits and gear restrictions to reduce release mortality.  These fish tend to become aggregated and vulnerable to heavy fishing pressure during the spring spawning season, so we feel it is especially important to enact regulations during this critical period in their life history. <br/> <br/>3. We recommend increased enforcement of existing fishing regulations in the Russian part of the species range.  Recent observations by research scientists have revealed illegal fishing operations, and much of the take, beginning in the 1980s and continuing to present, have gone unreported.  Our observations have indicated that fisheries officers that are hired to enforce existing regulations have been ineffectual, largely due to a lack of presence on the rivers, particularly during the critical spawning period.  We recommend increased vigilance to enforce fishing regulations intended to protect the species. <br/> <br/>4. We recommend investigating the role of habitat and population fragmentation, particularly in Japan.  Habitat fragmentation has been most widespread in Hokkaido, and we encourage actions that reduce and minimize further habitat loss, and restore habitat where possible.  We are aware of ten individual, local efforts in Hokkaido to raise awareness of lost and degraded taimen habitat (e.g., Obirame Restoration Group), but we feel much more can be done through a broader scale assessment of salmonid species diversity, threats, and cumulative aquatic habitat loss across Hokkaido.  A formal investigation by key public agencies into how to better balance flood plain development with conservation of rare species is critically important.  A key step has recently been taken to form the Committee of Critically Endangered Species (CCES) by the Hokkaido government, and we encourage this group to focus on habitat related issues involving conservation of Sakhalin taimen. <br/> <br/>5. We recommend formulating and enforcing best practices for infrastructure development, particularly related to resource extractive industries.  While much of the habitat for Sakhalin taimen in Russia is intact, there are a number of threats that exist.  Logging, road construction and pipeline development present threats to spawning habitat, in the form of increased bank instability, leading to accelerated erosion and sedimentation.  Road construction also leads to increased illegal fishing activities by providing easier access to rivers.  Sound best practices (e.g., riparian buffers, pipeline river crossings, culvert designs) need to be established and enforced to reduce erosion and allow unimpeded movement of fish throughout the watershed. <br/> <br/>6. While there has been some preliminary efforts in both Japan and Russia at captive breeding for the species, we feel these activities should proceed with great caution.  Inter-basin transplants could contribute to loss of locally adapted gene complexes.  We encourage basic research on the degree of geneflow that exists between river populations to understand phylogeographic patterns that could help guide future reintroductions.  Although there is some evidence that captive propagation can help reduce short-term extinction risk for critically endangered species, there is virtually no empirical evidence to indicate whether propagation can promote long-term sustainability.  Therefore, captive propagation efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild. <br/> <br/>7. Finally, given the myriad threats to the species, it's dramatic rate of decline, and it's cross border, limited distribution,  we feel it is important to establish an intergovernmental working group to consider formally our proposed conservation actions and draft an implementation plan to conserve the species.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, it is extirpated from the Aral Sea, nearly extirpated in the Black Sea basin and there are only occasional records from lower Volga. The only remaining population occurs in the rivers Ural (Russia, Kazakhstan) and possibly the Rioni (Georgia - last recorded 1997 through bycatch; there are no recent surveys), and possibly the Safid Rud (seven individuals recorded in 2002) in Iran. In Europe, it is thought that few individuals exist in the Danube - indeed it is considered possibly extinct. Even though there is no catch data it is suspected that the species has undergone a population decline of more than 90% in the past three generations (estimated at 45 years) which is expected to continue. It is believed the species is on the verge of global extinction. The largest population is in Lake Balkash (introduced for commercial reasons) which is outside the species natural range.","Habitat : At sea, close to shores and estuaries. In freshwater, deep stretches of large rivers. Juveniles in shallow riverine habitats. This species spawns in strong-current habitats in main courses of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom.<br/><br/>Biology: Anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed), with some non-migratory freshwater populations. Males reproduce for the first time at 6-15 years, females at 12-22, with an average generation length of 15 years (but in the Danube, the average population age has now increased and in the Caspian Sea, the average population age is decreasing because of overharvesting). In most drainages, there are two migration runs, in spring and autumn. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the river until the following spring to spawn. Females reproduce every 2-3 and males every 1-2 years in March-May and at temperatures above 10°C. Most juveniles move to sea in their first summer and remain there until maturity. Some individuals remain in freshwater for a longer period. Feeds on a wide variety of benthic fishes, molluscs and crustaceans.<br/><br/>This species has the highest relative fecundity for any sturgeon species (Chebanov pers. comm.).","Over harvesting, bycatch and illegal fishing (poaching) along with dams, water abstraction and drought has led to the loss of spawning habitats/ground and has caused massive population declines.

13040387,229,Acipenser stellatus,Critically Endangered,A2cde,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species was known from the Caspian, Black and Aegean Seas. It is now extirpated from the Aegean Sea, and in the Black Sea basin the last natural population migrates up the Danube where it is heavily overfished. Only very few spawners remain in the rest of the Black Sea basin. The Caspian populations are under massive pressure from overfishing (including poaching) and loss of spawning sites and the stocks are declining very fast. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. Overfishing will soon cause extinction of the natural populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Based on catch data, and number of individuals migrating into the Volga and Ural rivers it is estimated that the species has undergone a population decline of at least 80% (possibly close to 100%) in the past three generations (minimum estimate of 30 years, possibly up to 40), which is expected to continue. Catch data shows massive declines across the species range with a 98% decline between 1980 and 2007 in the Caspian Sea, and a 72.5% in four years (2002-2005) in Romania (Danube).","This species is found at sea, coastal and estuarine zones, where it forages on clayey sand bottoms, as well as intensively in middle and upper water layers. It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers, on stone or gravel bottoms. It is also known to spawn on flooded river banks, on sand or sandy clay. Juveniles inhabit shallow riverine habitats during their first summer&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Caspian fish first mature at 6-7 years for males, and 7-8 years for females, with a generation length not less than 10 years. Females reproduce every 3-4 years and males every 2-3 years in April-September. It spawns only under relatively constant hydrological conditions, as fluctuating hydrological conditions lead to high egg mortality. This species migrates upriver at higher temperatures and therefore later than other sturgeons, with two peaks, in spring and in autumn. Males remain at spawning sites no longer than six weeks and females only 10-12 days. Spent individuals migrate directly back to sea. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 2-3 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. At sea, this species feeds on a wide variety of crustaceans, molluscs and benthic as well as pelagic fish&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The main habitat in the Caspian Sea of the Stellate Sturgeon in the winter is the middle part of the sea (Legeza 1970). In the spring they migrate to the north, with its maximum density being observed off the mid-west coast in shallow water rich in food organisms (Legeza 1970). In late spring they move to the north-west coast. In autumn Stellate Sturgeons begin migrating to the south of the Caspian Sea (earlier than other species), concentrating at the mid-western coast and the south-eastern coast (Legeza 1970). <br/><br/>The spawning migration starts in April. Spawning occurs at temperatures from 9 to 16 °C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at the current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. The greatest number of Stellate Sturgeon migrate to the Ural River (Peseridi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1986, Dovgopol <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1992). Stellate Sturgeon stop eating after the beginning of the spawning migration. After spawning, they return downstream into the sea, where they begin actively feeding. The juveniles of Stellate Sturgeon also do not delay in the river and migrate for feeding into the sea.","The reason for Stellate Sturgeon abundance decrease is primarily due to marine fishing and a sharp increase of poaching, seizing the largest and mature fish and nullifying the natural reproduction of sturgeon. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Single specimens of Stellate Sturgeon were harvested at the Azerbaijan coast during a trawl survey in 1994; this is most likely due to heavy illegal fishing (large number of poaching gears were observed).<br/><br/>Overfishing has prevented hatcheries catching enough mature individuals to maintain the necessary broodstock (Artyukhin 1997 in CITES 2000), and stocking has severely decreased in the Caspian Sea as the stocking process relies upon wild individuals (unlike other sturgeon species they are difficult to keep mature individuals in ponds, Nikolai pers. comm.). The annual release (over the past 10 years) of sturgeon juveniles from sturgeon hatcheries in Russia amounts to from 3 to 20 million specimens; in Kazakhstan - from 2.5 to 4.1 million specimens; in Azerbaijan - from 2.5 to 6.8 million specimens; in Islamic Republic of Iran - from 0.2 to 1.3 million specimens. This quantity of stocks recruitment of Stellate Sturgeon from industrial sturgeon culture is not enough to supply the population at an optimum level&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Dams have also led to the loss of many spawning grounds. For example the Volgograd dam (built in 1955) led to loss of 40% of spawning sites formally available in the Volga (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). The species is also considered extirpated from the upper and middle Danube since the building of the Djerdap Dams (Iron Gate Dams). The Don River dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban led to the loss of 140,000 ha of spawning grounds.<br/><br/>Pollution is a threat to the species. In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species (Gessner, J. pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Introduced Mnemiopsis (from US) which impacts the species food source (pelagic fishes) has impacted the Black Sea population (impacts now reduced in Black Sea) and is now impacting the Caspian Sea populations.<br/><br/>Introduction of fertilized eggs (from before 1986 and again 2003/4, and it may continue) from the Caspian Sea into the Azov Sea may impact the genetic integrity of Azov Sea population (Chebanov pers. comm.).","In the early 1990s it was estimated that nearly 100% of the Sea of Azov population and 30% of the Caspian Sea population were from stocking. Recent estimations are that more than 50% of the Caspian Sea populations are from stocking (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Global catches show that in 1992, 2,730 tonnes were caught, falling to a low of 38 tonnes in 2004, and 50 tonnes in 2007 (a decline of over 98% in 15 years). The average catch between 1992-1999 was 1,063 tonnes, and between 2000 and 2007 it was 132 tonnes, a decline of 87% (FAO 2009). The decline in commercial catch for the species is believed to reflect a decline in the species population (CITES 2000). <br/><br/>For the whole Caspian basin, catch peaked in 1977 with 13,700 tonnes; this has shown an almost continuous decline to 305 tonnes in 2003 (most recent data) (over 97% decline in 32 years) (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In 2008 the agreed catch quota for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A.stellatus</span> for all Caspian Sea countries in 2008 was set at 240 tonnes, including commercial and scientific catch; the quota has not been met (Pourkazemi pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2009) shows that the average numbers of spawners entering the lower Volga per year has fallen from a peak of 230,000 (between 1986-90) to just 50,000 (between 1998-2002), a decline of 78%. It is expected that the decline has continued at a similar rate to the present time (though data does not exist) and will continue. In the Ural the estimated number of migrating individuals per year has also shown a decline, in 1970: 1,100,000; 1979: 1,050,000; 1990: 300,000 migrating individuals (Veschev 1995); 1998: 103,600; 2001: 87,400 (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). This shows a 92% decline from 1979 to 2001 (also from 1970 to 2001, as migrating individuals per year remained relatively stable between 1970 and 1979).<br/><br/>Distribution of Stellate Sturgeon in the Caspian Sea has declined (based on CPUE distribution data) from the 1970s to 2004 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).<br/><br/>In summer, Stellate Sturgeon feed in the warmer waters, forming the densest concentration, more than 0.6 specimens per 10,000 m<sup>3</sup> in the western region of the Caspian sea; this is four times higher than was recorded in 1994 (Khodorevskaya <em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). Concentration of all species of sturgeons and in particular, of Stellate Sturgeon, remains high in the area off the island of Ogurchinskii in the southern part of the Caspian Sea off the Turkmenian coast, but its abundance has declined 3.4 times compared to 1991&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The total population size in the investigated water in 2008 was between 6.7-9.5 million specimens, this has fallen from 83 million in 1988&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>Over recent decades, Stellate Sturgeon abundance in the Caspian Sea has reduced. Evidence of this is shown in the decrease of the average catch per unit effort during trawl surveys between 1978-1999. These showed a three-fold decrease in the northern Caspian Sea, a 2.7-fold decline in the middle part of the Caspian Sea and a six-fold decline off the Dagestan coast (Vlasenko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Decrease of CPUE has been more apparent in the southern part of the sea. The Stellate Sturgeon population has declined from 69.7 million specimens in 1978 to 15.6 million in 2002, and 7.6 million specimens in 2008. Commercial stock decreased by 12 times during this period&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In the Black Sea, in Romania, from 2002-2005 the catches of wild individuals (stocking only started in 2006 in the Danube) dropped from 12.427 tonnes to 3.43 tonnes (72.5% in 4 years); in 2006 commercial catch was stopped (Suciu pers comm.). In Azov Sea, no wild mature females have been caught [for a stocking programme] since 2004 (Chebanov pers. comm.).",Decreasing,"Stellate Sturgeon inhabits in the Caspian, Black and Azov Seas, and rarely in the Aegan Sea. The Volga, Ural, Terek, Sulak, Kura, Don, Danube, Kuban Rivers are the major spawning rivers. The length of the spawning migration route of the Volga to the cascade of dams is up to Rybinsk, in the Ural - to Uralsk, in the Don - to Pavlovsk, in the Kuban - to Armavir. The highest abundance and biomass of natural population remained in the Caspian Sea. <br/><br/>The feeding area in the Caspian Sea of Stellate Sturgeon extended from the shallow water area of the northern part of the sea to the Iranian coast. An intensive migration of Stellate Sturgeon began in spring (March-May) to the shallow water area, in the Northern Caspian where the largest concentrations of fish were observed at the western coast of this part of the sea, as well as in the pre-mouth areas in the eastern part of the Volga River Delta (Belinskii and Igolkinskii Banks&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009)).<br/><br/><br/><sup></sup>","Skin and as a leather.

The species last spawned in 1994 in the Garonne, where dams, pollution and river regulation has degraded and destroyed spawning sites. There are also plans to start gravel extraction. The current population size is between 20-750 wild, mature individuals (in the past three years there has been substantial stocking, but these animals will not reproduce until ~2016). Under normal population circumstances, the average reproductive age is suspected to be about 25 years. There has been more than a 90% population decline in the past 75 years based mainly on loss of habitat, along with pollution and exploitation.<br/><br/>This species now remains in just one location, where 27 spawning grounds (less than 10 km²<sup></sup>) remain potentially accessible (the major threat to this species is bycatch). As this species continues to be caught as bycatch, the population is still decreasing.","Biology: Anadromous (spends at least part of its life in salt water and returns to rivers to breed). <br/><br/>Males reproduce for the first time at 10-12 years, females at 14-18. There are indications for a reproduction at two year intervals for males and 3-4 years for females in April-July. Adults do not eat during migration and spawning. The distance of the spawning migration seems to be positively correlated with water level, and a distance of 1000 km or more may be covered during years of high water. Spent fishes immediately return to the sea (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>Potential spawning grounds have been mapped. Juveniles migrate downstream and are present in upper estuary at one year old. They continue a slow downstream migration and penetrate the sea at 2-3 years. For the next 4-6 years, they leave the sea to enter the lower estuary at summer time where movements and feeding were determined. At sea, this species feeds on a variety of molluscs, crustaceans and small fish. Atlantic population feed benthically.","Bycatch is the major threat and the extraction of gravel in the Garonne is a potential threat to the species. Dam construction, pollution and river regulation have led to loss and degradation of spawning sites.","The sturgeon was an important commercial fish until the beginning of the 20th century (Debus 2007). The last natural reproduction was in 1994 (previous reproduction in 1988). A population assessment in 2005 estimated 2,000 individuals remain. It is estimated that bycatch took around 200 fish per year (gill net and trawling at sea) (Rochard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997).<br/><br/>The size of the population today is much smaller (approximately 20-750 native wild adult fish, based on an assessment of the size the cohort before they leave the estuary).

The Caspian basin has lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s mainly due to hydroelectric power stations; flow regulation of the Kuban has led to the loss of 140,000 ha and damming of the river Don removed 68,000 ha spawning ground (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>The last natural population still migrates up the Danube and the Rioni (last recorded in Rioni in 1999), where the sturgeons are heavily overfished and poached. The Caspian populations are also under massive pressure from overfishing and loss of spawning habitats. Almost all migrating spawners are poached below the Volgograd dam. The Ural river still has spawning individuals.<br/><br/>It is estimated that the species' wild native population has undergone a massive population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (estimated at 45 years). This is based on the 88.5% decline in global catches of the species in just 15 years despite large levels of stocking (average global catch from 1992-1999 was 1,531.75 tonnes; from 2000-2007 it was 175.37 tonnes), the 92.5% decline in estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga from 1961-65 to 1998-2000, the 88% decline in the average number of spawners entering the lower Volga from the 1962-75 average to the 1992-2002 average, and the decline in the Juvenile Production Index from Romanian Danube.<br/><br/>This decline is predicted to continue as illegal fishing at sea, and in rivers, for caviar will soon result in the extinction of the remaining natural wild population. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking.","Habitat: At sea, shallow coastal and estuarine zones. In freshwaters, in deep parts of large rivers with moderate to swift current. Spawns in strong current (1-1.5 m/s) in large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. <br/><br/>Biology: Anadromous and freshwater populations (freshwater populations existed in the Danube and Volga - both are now extinct). A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes spring and autumn runs. Individuals migrating in spring enter freshwater just before spawning; they tend to spawn in lower reaches of rivers (320-650 km in the unregulated Ural). Individuals migrating in autumn overwinter in rivers and spawn the following spring further upstream (900-1200 km in the Ural). <br/><br/>Males reproduce for the first time at 8-13 years, females at 10-16. Generation length (average age of parents of current cohort) is estimated to be 15 years under natural circumstances, but due to the impacts this species is facing the generation length ranges from between 12 years in the Caspian Sea to over 20 in the Danube. Females reproduce every 4-6 years and males every 2-3 years in April-June, when the temperature rises above 10°C. Larvae drift on currents; juveniles then move towards shallower habitats, before migrating to the sea during their first summer. They remain at sea until maturity. The Russian Sturgeon feeds on a wide variety of benthic molluscs, crustaceans and small fish.","Most spawning sites have been lost due to dam construction. The Caspian basin lost 70% of spawning grounds since the 1950s, mainly due to the construction of hydroelectric power stations; the Ural is now the only river in the basin with unregulated flow. Flow regulation of the Kuban River has led to the loss of 140,000 ha, and damming of the river Don has removed 68,000 ha spawning ground. For example, in the Yugoslavian section of the Danube, the annual catch dropped from 14,636 kg in 1983 to 1,636 kg in 1985 (a decline of just under 90%), this is believed to be due to the construction of the Djerdap (Irongate) II dam which was constructed in 1984, leaving no accessible spawning grounds for the species in the upstream reaches and in former Yugoslavia (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Poaching and illegal fishing, which appears to be increasing, is also a threat to the species. Enforcement of legislation regulating the fishery for the species appear to be lacking. In the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov the illegal sturgeon catch for all species was evaluated to be 6 to 10 times the legal catch (CITES 2000). Bycatch is also a threat to the species (in both marine and freshwater).<br/><br/>High levels of pollution (from oil and industrial waste), in both the Black and Caspian Sea basins have altered hormonal balance, and increased the number of hermaphroditic fish. Pollution levels are now decreasing since the break up of the Soviet Union (Levin, 1977 in CITES 2000). In 1990, 55,000 sturgeon were found dead on the shore of the Sea of Azov as the result of pollution.<br/><br/>Genetic pollution is also a potential threat as stocks are moved to different locations (e.g. Caspian stocks moved to Sea of Azov).<br/><br/>The Allee affect is also a potential threat to the species.","The species wild native population has undergone major decline which is currently occurring. But due to the large levels of stocking (particularly Russia and Iran) the exact levels are unknown. According to CITES (2000) Russia released 25 million fingerlings into the Vologa between 1979-80, 35 million between 1981-85, 40.8 million between 1986-90, 42 million between 1991-95 and 28 million 1996-98; Iran released 300,000 fingerlings in 1994 which has risen nearly every year to 960,000 in 1999.<br/><br/>Despite this level of stocking, fisheries catches have fallen, particularly from the early 1990s in the Caspian. According to FAO fisheries statistics (FAO 2009) global catches fell from 4,250 tonnes in 1992 (first available catch data) to 67 tonnes in 2007 (last available catch data), a decline of 98% in 15 years. The average catch from 1992-1999 (8 year period) was 1,531.75 tonnes, whereas the average catch from 2000-2007 (8 year period) was 175.37 tonnes, a decline of 88.5%.<br/><br/>Data from the Caspian Sea (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009) shows similar declines: catches were between 6,000 and 9,000 tonnes per year in the 1960s to a peak of around 14,500 tonnes in the late 1970s early 1980s to less than 1,000 per year from 2000 to 2008. The estimated spawning stock biomass in the Volga has also drastically declined, from 13,200 tonnes (1961-65) and 22,200 tonnes (1966-70) to 1,000 tonnes (1996-97) and 1,000 tonnes (1998-2002).

A Juvenile Production Index (evidence of breeding) for the Danube (Romania) also shows a decline: CPUE was just over 0.7 in 2000, &lt; 0.2 in 2001, 0.3 in 2002, 0 in 2003, &lt; 0.1 in 2004, 0.1 in 2005, 0 in 2006, &lt; 0.05 in 2007 and 0 in 2008.

In 1996, fish inspection authorities filed 8,000 citations for violations committed by individuals, mainly in the Astrakhan region along the Volga (Vecsei and Artyukhin 2001).<br/><br/>In Iran, pollution from agriculture and domestic waste causes loss and degradation of spawning sites. In Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, oil and industrial pollution has led to the loss of suitable feeding grounds. In Russia, oil pollution is a potential threat.

This species was historically recorded in southwestern Korea and in western Kyushu, Japan and in the Yellow, Yangtze, Pear, Mingjiang, and Qingtang rivers in China, but has been extirpated from all of these areas except for the mid-lower section of the Yangtze River, below the Gezhouba dam. This species was historically overfished. In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals, but between 2005-2007 the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was estimated to be 203-257 individuals. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground (a 4 km stretch of river), which is situated below the Gezhouba dam. Furthermore, in 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles (including larvae) were released into Yangtze River to increase population numbers, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10%. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Young of this species live in estuarine and nearshore habitats. When the species becomes sexually mature, it migrates up-river. Nearly mature adults (early stage III) arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River in June or July. The adults do not feed while in the river. <br/><br/>Adults reach the middle sections of the river in September or October, where they overwinter. Ripe individuals were formerly found as far inland as the Jingsha River during the following October and November, where they spawned. Prior to construction of the Gezhouba Dam, the migration distance was as long as 2,500 to 3,300 km. Spawning sites often occur in turbulent sections of the river with rocky substrate and steep cliffs on both banks.<br/><br/>The roe is very large and it sinks and sticks to gravel until hatching. The hatched fries descend from the river to sea near the coast where they grow.

Individuals from 25 to 250 kg in weight were registered in some fishing grounds of East China Sea and Yellow Sea. This species attains a length of more than 3 metres.","This species has been historically overfished. In the 1970s, fishing was unlimited, but seasonal (occurring mostly between October and November). Gear types include gill nets (upper reach) and row hooks (middle reach).&#160; Due to its life history characteristics, once depleted, stocks of this species take a long time to recover. Fry are also captured by traditional Chinese fishing methods (drift nets in the river and set nets at the river mouth).<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, alteration, destruction and changes to hydrological conditions also significantly impacts this species. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach&#160; spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground, which is situated below the Gezhouba dam.<br/><br/>In 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam.

Synthetic chemicals in water could contribute to the population decline of this species by significantly decreasing both the quality and quantity of eggs and spawning frequency of fish (Hu 2009).","In the 1960s, this stock supported a major commercial fishery, but catches in the late 1970s had declined to about 500 fish per year (The Changjiang Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals. In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba dam isolated the upper reaches of the Yangtze river. In 1983 and 1984, the mean spawning stock size was estimated at 2,176 individuals (946 and 4,169 as 95% confidence intervals). Available data from acoustic surveys show that between 2005 and 2007, the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was 203-257. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period.<br/><br/>During 1996-2001, studies using tag-recapture methods, population structure analysis and sonar counting indicated that the spawning stock in the Yichang spawning area (mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze river) had decreased since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam.

As with many new fisheries, the initial quota was set quite high but was never achieved. As catches declined, subsequent quota revisions and reductions were not based on any particular biological or assessment information, primarily because that information was severely lacking (Atkinson 1995). The number of biological papers concerning the species were very few and most basic biological information was not gathered until 15–25 years after the fishery began (Haedrich <em>et al</em>. 2001).

Furthermore, deep populations of slope species are not separate from shallow ones because of ontogenetic migrations. Coryphaenoides move up and down the slope seasonally, migrating to shallower water at the end of summer and shifting deeper in winter (Dushchenko and Savvatimsky 1987,Paz and Iglesias 1994). <em>Macrourus</em> also migrate seasonally (Paz and Iglesias 1994) and follow the ‘bigger–deeper’ rule in the northwest Atlantic, with smaller juveniles generally occurring shallower than the larger adults (Savvatimsky and Gorchinsky 2001).

It is demersal on the outer continental shelf at depths of 82–200 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears,  including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet, and is retained, mostly  for fish meal. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak EEZs indicate declines of 54–98% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.

The species is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of this species. The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>This species is a retained bycatch in deep-water trawl fisheries in the South China Sea off southwest Taiwan (Nakaya <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistic pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273–12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is landed as trash fish and used as fish meal and also possibly to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020).&#160; The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>This species was considered a common species 10 years ago in Malaysia when there were large vessels that fished in the South China Sea. These vessels have since stopped operating and this species is no longer landed in Malaysia as trawlers only operate to a depth of ~80 m (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The gulf coast of Thailand is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg/hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg/hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014). This likely has subjected the Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark to increasing levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Future development in the region, such as the 'nine-dash line' area claimed by China and the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, may enable increased fishing pressure and habitat degradation through dredging and land creation activities (Mora <em>et al</em>. 2016). The recent discovery of their clear egg cases may make this species a target for aquaria in the future (Nakaya <em>et al</em>. 2020).","There are no species-specific time series data for this species, but there are shark landings data and reconstructed sharks, rays, and skates landings data available from the region. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Its distribution includes areas of extensive fishing pressure (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and there is a high degree of overlap between the species' range and fisheries. Fisheries landings from the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand increased from the 1950s until the late 1990s at which point catch has since been maintained around 10.5 million t (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2017). Despite this, stock assessments have shown that the majority of assessed stocks were fully fished or overfished (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2017), including lower trophic level species (Funge-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). There has also been a shift in species composition as larger species abundances, including sharks, have declined significantly. This decline was thought to have taken place between 1975–1985 when there was massive fisheries expansion (Funge-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). Sharks and rays are now considered depleted or overfished throughout the South China Sea.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, the landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953 to 2015 (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Gulf of Thailand, reconstructed catch data showed a 74% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches fluctuated since 1950–1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In east coast Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed landings showed a 30% decline from a peak of 17,604 t in 1999 to 12,314 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1990s, dropped during the early 2000s then rose to the 2014 landings. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. In Sarawak, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 50% decline from a peak of 14,690 t in 1997 to 7,300 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to 1980, dropped then peaked again in 1995–1997 before sharply declining. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in Borneo. In Sabah, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 37% decline from a peak of ~27,000 t in 1998 to 17,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>When declines in Taiwan, China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and Sabah are scaled to three generation lengths (45 years), they represent declines of 90%, 54%, 96%, 98%, 66%, 84%, and 73%, respectively. While these levels of declines are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark. The species has no refuge from fishing pressure. Swellsharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (see the Whitefin Swellshark <em>C. albipinnum</em>, Pardo <em>et al</em>. 2019). Overall, a population reduction of &gt;80% is suspected over the last three generation lengths (45 years), based on levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Taiwan to Borneo including China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Brunei, and Malaysia (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark is of limited value for food and is considered a trash fish and used for fish meal (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In Taiwan, since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nautical miles (nm) in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 27 August 2019). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF <a>2015</a>). Most marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region are found in inshore, shallow waters and thus, are unlikely to provide any refuge for this species. <br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global
46909843,7862,Epinephelus striatus,Critically Endangered,A4bd,2018,2016-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widely distributed in the greater Caribbean where it inhabits coral and rocky reef habitat. It is highly-valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, and heavy fishing pressure has caused severe declines in most countries where it was previously naturally abundant. It is especially susceptible to rapid population declines when heavy fishing effort occurs on the large seasonal spawning aggregations that the species forms at the same sites each year. Due to overfishing, more than 30 of the known 50 aggregations across its range have disappeared (ceased to form), and the size of most aggregations have been reduced by 90% or more. Based on landings data and observations of spawning aggregations, population declines of about 80% have occurred in Mexico since the early 1980s, 80% in the Bahamas since the late 1980s, 90% in Puerto Rico since the 1980s/mid-1990s and 80% in Cuba since the late 1970s. Similarly severe declines, but where quantitative data are not available, have also been confirmed within approximately the same time period from Bermuda, the continental U.S. (south Florida), the Dominican Republic, Belize, Honduras, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. At least one exception is in the Turks and Caicos where fishing effort has been relatively low. Conservation actions aimed at reducing fishing or completely banning fishing for Nassau Grouper have been established in many countries, some for well over a decade, but insufficient enforcement and low compliance in many areas has prevented population recovery, and even allowed further declines to occur. Although, signs of some recovery have been reported from protected aggregation sites in the Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands. Additional protection for the Wider Caribbean was recently conferred when the Nassau Grouper was added to Annex III of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol in&#160;March 2017. Under this environmental treaty, most countries within its range are now legally-bound to properly regulate exploitation levels so as to maintain/recover populations. Based on the decline in spawning aggregations (60%) over the past 36 years (1980-2016, two generation lengths) and the likelihood that the population will continue to decline&#160;into the future (though likely at a slower rate than 20 years ago) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, an exponential regression was applied to calculate the decline over three generation lengths (1980-2031), resulting in a 73% decline.&#160;However, as the size of the spawning aggregations has also substantially declined over this time period, it is highly likely that this is an underestimate, and the global population will decline by more than 80% over the three generation length time window that includes both the past and the future. For example, a conservative estimate of 10,000 individuals per aggregation in the 1980s and 3,000 individuals in 2016 would result in an overall population decline of 95% over the three generation length time window (1980-2031). Therefore, this species is listed as Critically Endangered A4bd. Recommended conservation priorities include establishment of protection of spawning aggregations and remaining populations, improvement of fishing regulation enforcement and implementation of regional management strategies that includes monitoring of aggregation status. Further research is needed on the formation of aggregations, reproductive output and to determine the status of lesser-studied aggregations.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species prefers clear water with high relief coral reefs or rocky substrate (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Early-stage juveniles inhabit inshore habitats including macroalgal clumps, seagrass beds and coral reefs (Eggleston 1995, Dahlgren 1998, Claydon and Kroetz 2007). It occurs to a depth of at least 140 metres, but individuals have been recorded to regularly descend to depths of 255 metres during spawning season.&#160;This species exhibits highly synchronized seasonal migrations to specific sites, typically located on outer reef drop-offs,&#160;where hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals aggregate to spawn (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2007).&#160;Migrations by individuals to spawning aggregations can exceed 200 km in one season (Bolden 2000, Dahlgren <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Individuals may spend many weeks away from their home reefs during the spawning season, but spend a relatively limited time on the actual spawning site (Dahlgren<em> et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The species is functionally gonochoristic (Sadovy and Colin 1995).<br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>Sexual maturity is reached at about 4-5 years of age and a total length of 55 cm (Cushion 2010, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013), though mature individuals from 39 to 46 cm total length have been reported in some studies (Claro <em>et al</em>. 1990, Aguilar-Perera 2004). According to a study conducted in the Cayman Islands on a population&#160;that has experienced relatively low fishing effort historically, longevity is about 29 years (Bush <em style="""">et al</em>. 1996, 2006).&#160;Elsewhere, individuals have been aged to nine years in the Virgin Islands (highly exploited population;&#160;Olsen and LaPlace 1979), 12 years in northern Cuba, 17 years in southern Cuba (Claro <em>et al</em>. 1990) and 21 years in the Bahamas (Sadovy and Colin 1995).&#160;Sadovy and Eklund (1999) estimated&#160;generation time (average age of parents in the population) to be 9-10 years, but this is now considered to be likely an underestimate of its natural, pre-exploitation generation length. Therefore, the generation length is adjusted as follows from the assessment conducted in 2003. Based on a longevity of 29 years, age of first maturity of five years,&#160;and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood&#160;(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 17 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species, particularly heavy fishing on spawning aggregations. Although this species also inhabits rocky reefs, these are unlikely to be able to compensate for the loss of quality coral reef habitat. Between 1970-2011 (41 years), an overall 59% decline in coral cover was directly observed in the Caribbean, which was caused by anthropogenic stressors, <em>Diadema antillarum</em> decline, and coral disease (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has also been identified as a prey item of the invasive Lionfish, with only juveniles being consumed (Morris and Akins 2009, Green <em>et al.</em> 2012). Lionfish may also compete with Nassau Grouper for reef shelter (Raymond<em> et al.</em> 2015).","Within its range, this species was naturally abundant in areas with large shelf platform habitat, such as Belize, the Bahamas, Cuba and others of the Greater Antilles, and less abundant in areas such as continental South America (e.g., Colombia and Venezuela; Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017). There&#160;is evidence that there is strong genetic differentiation among Nassau Grouper subpopulations in the Caribbean region (Jackson<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>A summary of population status and trends in Table 1 of the Supplementary Information. During the first U.S. survey of the fishery resources of Puerto Rico, this species was noted as a common and very important food fish, reaching a weight of 50 lbs (22.7 kg) or more (Evermann 1900). In 1970, it was still a common shallow water species landed in Puerto Rico (Thompson 1978), the Virgin Islands, Cuba, Belize and elsewhere. Data on all&#160;known spawning aggregation sites&#160;have been collected&#160;and are collated in the Science and Conservation of Fish Aggregations (SCRFA) database&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). In the past, aggregations were estimated to consist of 10,000 to 30,000 and up to 100,000 individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972; Olsen and LaPlace 1979; Colin<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1987; Fine 1990, 1992; Carter&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994; Sadovy 1997). Aggregations still reported to exist as of 2007 had greatly declined due to overexploitation and contained only 100 to rarely 3,000 individuals, with declines ongoing since then (Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Over the past 40 years, widespread overfishing has occurred for this species in most countries across its range, with many populations now commercially non-viable. Due to intense fishing effort during spawning season, the size of aggregations has severely declined (from 10,000-100,000 individuals per aggregation to 100-3,000 individuals; greater than 90% decline), and the number of known individual aggregations has been reduced from at least 50 to less than 20 (a 60% decline; Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2008, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2012).Underwater surveys and fishery data indicate that abundance is very low in almost all areas as compared to historical levels (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013). Underwater surveys conducted between 2003-2013 that are collated in the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) database show very low density and sighting frequencies in about 20 countries except the Turks and Caicos, Cayman Islands and parts of the Bahamas. Depending on the country, subpopulations are likely to either be stable (e.g., the U.S.) or in decline (e.g., Cuba, Belize, Puerto Rico), and despite conservation measures in several countries, there has been very limited to no recovery of overexploited populations. Several countries where fishing pressure has also been high, but where quantitative data are not available or only anecdotal reports exist (e.g., Jamaica), are inferred to have experienced declines at the same level as countries with quantitative data (e.g., the Bahamas).&#160;Based on the decline in spawning aggregations (60%) over the past 36 years (1980-2016; two generation lengths) and the likelihood that the population will continue to decline&#160;into the future due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, an exponential regression was applied to calculate the decline over three generation lengths (1980-2031), resulting in a 73% decline.&#160;However, as the size of the spawning aggregations has also substantially declined over this time period, it is highly likely that this is an underestimate, and the global population will decline by more than 80% over the three generation length time window that includes both the past and the future. For example, a conservative estimate of 10,000 individuals per aggregation in the 1980s and 3,000 individuals in 2016 would result in an overall population decline of 95% over the three generation length time window (1980-2031).<br/><strong><br/>Bermuda:&#160;</strong>Fishery landings in Bermuda were once dominated by grouper and snapper before their populations severely declined (Burnett-Herkes and Barnes 1996). In 1975, Nassau Grouper comprised 16% of the total grouper catch by weight, but declined to less than 1% of the catch by 1989 (Bannerot<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1987, Report of the Commission of Inquiry Bermuda 1991). According to fisher interviews, all four known historical aggregations no longer formed and had probably crashed by 1981 (Bannerot&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1987, Luckhurst 1996). Despite subsequent protection, the fishery remains commercially non-viable (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>U.S. continental:<em>&#160;</em></strong><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The fishery for this species in the continental U.S. has been closed since 1992 and possession is prohibited (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Despite these measures, spawning aggregations, including in the Dry Tortugas off Florida, have not recovered (Ault&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2013).&#160;<br/></span><strong><br/>Mexico:&#160;</strong>According to fisher interviews, the large aggregations on Alacranes Reef off Mexico have been exhausted by overfishing and spawning activity has not been documented at all in recent years (Aguilar-Perera and Tuz-Sulub 2012). A historically large aggregation of about 1,000-15,000 individuals also disappeared off Mahahual, Mexico in 1996 (Aguilar-Perera and Aguilar-Davila 1996, Aguilar-Perera 2006). Surveys conducted since then indicate that the aggregation has not recovered (Aguilar-Perera 2014). According to fishers, another aggregation south of Playa del Carmen at Punta Iná was also extirpated during the early 1980s (Sosa-Cordero <em>et al.</em> 2009). An aggregation of about 2,000 individuals remains off Punta Gavilán in southern Quintana Roo (Medina-Quej <em>et al</em>. 2004, Aguilar-Perera <em>et al. </em>2009, Fulton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Only five out of the 28 spawning aggregations along the Mexican Caribbean coast mentioned by fishers&#160;during interviews have been scientifically validated (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al.</em> 2009). An aggregation of at least 1,000 individuals&#160;was recently confirmed in the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve (Fulton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aggregate annual grouper landings in the Mexican Caribbean declined from 19,200 kg in 1998 to 4,000 kg in 2005, which is a period of about seven years (Aguilar-Perera<em> et al</em>. 2009, Sosa-Cordero <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Bahamas:</strong>&#160;The population of Nassau Grouper in the Bahamas was one of the largest across its range. It has been a historically important component of Bahamian fisheries which primarily targeted spawning aggregations (Colin 1992) and the first and largest ever reported aggregation (30,000 to 100,000 fish) was documented in Bimini by Lavett-Smith (1972). To date, at least 31 aggregation sites&#160;have been reported (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2012), and 23 have been confirmed by direct observation or catch monitoring (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In the 1970-1980s, aggregations ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals (Lavett-Smith 1972, Colin 1992).&#160;By the late 1990s to early 2000s, the population in the Bahamas was likely fully exploited to overexploited and aggregations were significantly reduced in size (Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007, Cheung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Reported annual landings from 1994 to 2011 declined by about 83% (650 tonnes to 113 tonnes). In addition to landings, mean body size of individuals in the catch has also declined since the 1990s and the proportion of Nassau Grouper in the catch declined from 10% to 4% from 1994 to 2009 (Cheung <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Landings of this species in the Bahamas declined by 86% since 1997&#160;(18 years), and despite fishery management measures, recovery has not occurred (Sherman<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016)<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. </span>Underwater reef surveys also recorded declines in numbers of observed Nassau Grouper over time.&#160;In 1992, over 20 spawning aggregations were&#160;being exploited across the Bahamas (NMFS 1992, R. Thompson pers. comm). The current status of many of these is unknown largely due to the lack of survey work in recent years: only four have been reported in recent scientific literature (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;Underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted during the spawning season of 2013 at the aggregation site originally described by Lavett-Smith (1972) failed to find any sign of Nassau Grouper (Erisman <em>et al.</em> 2014). Diver and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in January 2002 around Long Island in the Bahamas at a known historically large aggregation site found no more than 28 individuals per survey and no spawning behaviour was observed (Gascoigne 2002, D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). Interviews with local fishers further indicated that spawning aggregations no longer occurred in the area (D. Eggleston pers. comm. 2014). The aggregation at High Cay was also reported to consist of an order of magnitude fewer spawners than its historical size (Gascoigne 2002, Ehrhardt and Deleveaux 2007). Hydroacoustic surveys conducted at High Cay recorded&#160;10,523 kg of fish in 1999, 9,300 in 2000 and 12,857 in 2001, although the reliability of this method has not been validated. Dive surveys conducted at this site in 2000-2001 found no evidence of an aggregation (Carleton Ray<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2000, Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).&#160;A recent study of genetic structure in the Bahamas showed that this species continues to support mostly high levels of genetic diversity with no evidence for geographic population structure and there is significant, but weak, genetic differentiation in Nassau Grouper throughout the Bahamian archipelago. Analyses of the last 1,000 generations indicate a pronounced historic decline in Bahamian Nassau Grouper that appears to pre-date anthropogenic fishing activities. There is additional evidence that population bottlenecks have occurred in several sites (Sherman <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><strong><br/>Turks and Caicos:</strong><em>&#160;</em>This species is highly valued by the dive tourism and restaurant industries in the Turk and Caicos. Fishing pressure has been relatively low historically and the population appears to be healthy (Rudd 2003, Vo <em>et al</em>. 2014), although effort to supply local markets has recently increased (Dept. of Environment and Coastal Resources Turks and Caicos Islands 2008).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Cuba:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Historically, this was among the most important finfish species landed in Cuban fisheries, yielding some of the highest catches anywhere within its geographic range (Claro<em> et al.</em> 2001). Fishing pressure increased notably after 1959, with landings reaching 1,700 metric tonnes in 1963 and declining thereafter. The majority of landings were taken from spawning aggregations in the Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago&#160;(Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003). Until 1969, some of this catch was obtained from the Bahamas shelf.&#160;Landings data, which have been collected monthly since the 1960s, indicate a sharp decline occurred after 1969 partly due to the closure of the fishery in Sabana-Camaguey and&#160;targeting of spawning aggregations (Claro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001, 2009). Despite some protective management, a sudden collapse occurred in the late 1970s. Overall finfish landings gradually increased between 1962 and 1998 presumably due to increasing fishing effort, but Nassau Grouper declined steeply (Claro and Lindeman&#160;2003, Claro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al. </em>2008). By 2008, only a few spawning aggregations remained viable off Cuba (Claro <em>et al. </em>2009). The species is still captured by recreational fishers, but the population cannot support a viable commercial fishery. According to landings data and spawning aggregation studies, the population in Cuba is suspected to have declined by more than 80% over the past 30 years (three generations) (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Dominican Republic:</strong>&#160;This species is primarily captured in the trap fishery in the Dominican Republic (Munro and Thompson 1983). Landings have not been reported from the Dominican Republic for many years, and the species appears to have been severely depleted in local waters. Poaching by Dominican vessels in Bahamian waters for this species has been reported.<br/><strong><br/>Continental South America:&#160;</strong>This species occurs in continental South America, but aggregations have not been reported, and landings are no longer significant (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Belize:<em> </em></strong>Historically this species was extremely abundant in Belize (Craig 1966, Paz and Grimshaw 2001). However, many aggregations have been severely reduced, such as at Mexico Rocks, Rise and Fall Bank and Caye Glory (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Paz and Grimshaw&#160;</span>2001). The aggregation at Caye Glory reportedly supported tens of thousands of individuals and catch once exceeded an estimated 30,000 fish during just one spawning season (Craig 1966). In the late 1960s, grouper catches reached two tons per day at Caye Glory, but a survey conducted in January of 2001 recorded just 21 fish and fishermen caught only nine fish over four days (Heyman and Wade 2007). At least 15 spawning aggregation sites are known from Belize, and regular surveys of 14 of them indicate that only a few hundred to a few thousand fish remain today (Burns Perez and Tewfick 2016). All these aggregation sites have undergone dramatic declines in fish abundance over the past two decades and despite some protective measures that have reduced fishing effort on these aggregations, recovery does not appear to be occurring. Northeast Point off Glover’s Reef Atoll, which is one of the last viable (larger) spawning aggregations of Nassau Grouper in Belize, has varied in abundance with peaks of more than 3,000 individuals in 2001, 2005 and 2010, but generally declined by over 85% to 450 individuals in 2015. This decline coincides with the occurrence of illegal fishing in the area (Burns Perez and Tewfik 2016).<br/><strong><br/>Honduras and Nicaragua: </strong>This species is commercially exploited in&#160;Honduras and Nicaragua, but catch data are not available. Imports of this species into the U.S. from these countries, as reported by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, have declined since the 1990s. In Honduras, it appears likely that catch of Nassau Grouper has diminished since 2005 (Box and Bonilla 2008, Arrivillaga 2011). A two-year fishery survey conducted in the Bay Islands of Honduras reported the occurrence of immature Nassau Grouper individuals in the artisanal fishery in east Roatán and Guanaja (Gobert<em> et al.</em> 2005). Nassau Grouper landings in the Bay Islands increased until the late 1980s to early 1990s before declining by 2003 due to uncontrolled fishing of spawning aggregations in the 1990s (Box and Bonilla 2008). For example, an aggregation near Guanaja was reduced from approximately 10,000 fish to less than 500 in two years and appears to have been eradicated in the early 1990s (Fine 1990, 1992), but has not been surveyed since. Fishers have reported the existence of several other spawning sites, but their condition is unknown. The aggregation at Banco Campiche is still likely to exist in part due to its inaccessibility (Box and Bonilla 2008). Anecdotal accounts from fishers as well as reductions in exports of Nassau and Red Grouper over the past few decades also indicate population declines have occurred (Box and Bonilla 2008, Canty and Box 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Lesser Antilles:&#160;</strong>Little is known of the status of this species in the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and reported catches are generally low (Hill and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Jamaica:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Fishing effort in Jamaica increased significantly with the advent of motorized boats and mechanized gears, which led to lower catch rates of all reef fish and the disappearance of some species, including the Nassau Grouper, from multispecies catches (Stevenson 1981). Fishery surveys conducted in the early 1970s in Jamaica recorded a catch per unit effort of 1.4 to 1.7 kg of Nassau Grouper per hour (Munro 1983).&#160;An underwater survey of reef fishes in Jamaica in 1986 revealed no groupers (Koslow <em>et al.</em> 1988), and by 1989, Nassau Grouper were rarely caught (Sadovy 1997). Its current status in Jamaica is not well-understood.<br/><strong><br/>Cayman Islands:&#160;</strong>Catches of Nassau Grouper in the Cayman Islands have declined since 1996 due to overfishing (Whaylen<em> et al.</em> 2004, Bush<em> et al.</em> 2006). However, according to surveys conducted on several spawning aggregations, this species&#160;may still be relatively abundant in the Cayman Islands, which is also one of few places within its range where the fishery is effectively managed (Patengill-Semmens and Semmens 2003). Surveys conducted from 2003 to 2013 recorded 1,857 Nassau Grouper individuals during 3,746 surveys (density index 1.7, sighting frequency 49.6%) in the Cayman Islands (REEF 2013). Five&#160;aggregation sites are confirmed in the Cayman Islands, with one off western Little Cayman likely to be the largest remaining aggregation (in terms of fish numbers) throughout its global range. This aggregation is still considered healthy despite two years of heavy fishing pressure; during 20 days of fishing in the 2001 and 2002 spawning season, approximately 4,000 fish were taken (Whaylen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Pre-fishing abundance for this aggregation was estimated at over 7,000 fish (Bush<em> et al. </em>2006). According to studies conducted between 1987 and 2001, three of the Cayman Island aggregations were considered overfished with catch in the low hundreds and continuing to decline (Bush<em> et al.</em> 2006). The Little Cayman east end site was abandoned by fishers in 1993 when the aggregation ceased to form.&#160;Following the re-discovery of the spawning aggregation in Cayman Brac, catch was in the low thousands during the initial years, but it has declined drastically in the past six years. Based on a mark-recapture study conducted in Cayman Brac, fishermen were capturing 15-20% of the spawning population outside the spawning season, which indicates that the Nassau Grouper population may continue to decline even with a closure of the fishery during spawning season (B. Semmens pers. comm. 2012).<br/><strong><br/>Puerto Rico:<em>&#160;</em></strong>This species once dominated catches in Puerto Rico from the 1950s to 1970s, but began declining in the 1980s and by 1988-1989 was rare and represented only 2% of grouper landings and 0.2% of all demersal fish species (Sadovy 1993, Sadovy and Eklund 1999, PRDNR 2012). By 1990, it was considered commercially non-viable (Matos-Caraballo 2008).&#160;In Puerto Rico, landings of this species are available for the 17 year period of 1998-2011, landings declined from a high of 19,085&#160;lbs in 1998 to 260 lbs in 2011, which represents a 99% decline over a 13 year period (Matos-Caraballo 2012; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><strong style=""""><br/>U.S. Virgin Islands:<em>&#160;</em></strong>By 1981, Nassau Grouper had practically disappeared from local fishery catches in the Greater Antilles (CFMC 1985), and by 1986, it was considered commercially non-viable in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico (Bohnsack <em>et al</em>. 1986). Its current status in this area is poorly known. The Nassau Grouper fishery collapsed in the USVI in the late 1970s (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), and no significant spawning aggregation formed afterwards. One aggregation in the 1970s contained an estimated 2,000-3,000 individuals (Olsen and LaPlace 1979), but is no longer viable today. Fishermen have reported a possible recurrence of an aggregation south of St. John (D. Olsen pers. comm. 2011) and dive surveys conducted in 2001-2004 indicate that an aggregation may be re-forming at Grammanik Bank south of St. Thomas (Nemeth <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kadison <em>et al</em>. 2010). Further work conducted in 2004-2006 documented some increased settlement/recruitment in nearshore habitats in both St. Thomas and St. John (Nemeth <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from South Carolina, south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys, the Flower Garden Banks, southwestern Texas and Tuxpan, Mexico along the northern Yucatan to northwestern Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Venezuela (Hickerson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It does not occur in Brazil (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Moura 2001). Its depth range is 0-255 metres.","This species is highly-valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range and is traded on the international level in some areas. It is also valued for domestic trade&#160;as well as&#160;dive ecotourism. It is taken by handline, longline, fish traps, spear guns and gillnets (Sadovy and Eklund 1999).",Marine,"Conservation strategies for this species vary widely by country, and include a total ban on take, fishing restrictions and area/temporal protection for spawning aggregations (Garcia-Moliner and Sadovy 2008).&#160;In March 2017, the Nassau Grouper was added to Annex III of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) protocol, which is a legally binding regional environmental treaty for the Wider Caribbean region. This confers some regional protection for the species with most countries within its range being signatories except Mexico. For species listed under Annex III, exploitation is authorized but must be regulated so as to maintain populations at an optimal level. However, historical issues with low compliance and insufficient enforcement lessens the potential for in-place fishing regulations to allow populations to recover in many countries. Furthermore, even areas that have enacted effectively-enforced protection for a decade or more have documented only minimal to no recovery of populations. Some countries have established marine protected areas (MPAs) based on the localities of spawning aggregations. It has been raised successfully in a hatchery, but not at a commercial scale. Although removing fishing effort on aggregations is a very important conservation action for this species, focusing protection only on spawning aggregations is likely to be insufficient, and migratory routes should also be considered (Dahlgren <em>et al</em>. 2016). According to Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al</em>. (2012) conservation priorities are as follows: (1) prevent overfishing of spawning aggregations; (2) protect sub-adult fish capture by establishing a minimum size limit at or above the size of sexual maturation; (3) protect remnant populations from fishing; (4) improve enforcement of fishery closures and address illegal, unmonitored and unregulated trade; (5) implement regional management strategies where the SPAW&#160; protocol might be applicable; (6) decisions may be needed in countries with remaining viable populations of Nassau grouper as to whether this species should be retained for food security or export trade or conserved for tourism and reef health. A precautionary and regional approach to management of remaining Nassau Grouper populations is essential to reduce the further declines (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2016). Further research is also needed on formation of aggregations, individual spawning frequency, reproductive output in small versus large aggregations, update surveys of lesser-studied historical aggregations and establish regular monitoring of aggregations.<br/><br/>In U.S. federal and state waters, which includes Puerto Rico (since 2004) and the Virgin Islands, there has been a total ban on fishing for Nassau Grouper since 1992. Three spawning aggregation sites in the Bahamas - High Cay and two sites off eastern Long Island - were protected by law in 1999. Fishing for Nassau Grouper was also banned throughout the Bahamas in 2000. However, enforcement has been mostly lacking (N. Nuttall pers. comm.). Currently, there is a fishing and sales ban from December to February. It has been recommended that fishing effort in the Bahamas be reduced to 2001 levels to avoid further overexploitation (Cheung<em> et al</em>. 2013). In 1997, the Mexican fishery authority banned fishing of Nassau Grouper during spawning aggregation season (December to February; Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009), but this regulation has since disappeared with a change in the law. There has been a one-month ban on grouper fishing in Mexico since 2005, and in 2014, this ban was extended to two months (Aguilar-Perera 2016). In the Mexican Caribbean, several important spawning sites are located within MPAs (e.g., Xcalak Reef National Park and Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve; Medina Quej <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fulton<em> et al</em>. 2016). Under the “Refugios Pesqueros” (Fishery Refuges) initiative, the Mexican fishing authority (CONAPESCA) also designated several no-take areas based on the request of fishing organizations with civil support (Diario Oficial de la Federación 2012).&#160;In Belize, fishing on&#160;most Nassau Grouper aggregations has been banned since 2002, with all&#160;thirteen known sites protected since 2012. In addition, there is&#160;a four month closed season and catch size limits&#160;(Burns-Perez and Tewfik 2016).&#160;In the Cayman Islands, gear has been restricted to line-fishing only and fishing during spawning season in three main 'grouper holes' has been permitted only for residents since 1978 (P. Bush pers. comm. 2001). In 2003, fishing was closed at all known spawning sites for a period of eight years with an extension in 2011 for another eight years. Numbers of individuals in at least one aggregation have increased since (Department of Environment 2011, Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2012). In August of 2016, the Cayman Islands government enacted a comprehensive set of regulations aimed at Nassau Grouper that represent the most progressive set of management actions throughout its range. These actions include: (1) All take, possession, or sale of Nassau Grouper is prohibited during spawning season from December through April (2) When take is permitted (May through November), only fish between 16""-24” can be kept and no more than 5 per fishing vessel per day (3) Spearfishing is prohibited. Grouper fishing is prohibited in the Dominican Republic during spawning season and a quota system was introduced in Cuba (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In Bermuda, Nassau Grouper fishing has been banned since 1996 and there are several no-take MPAs, but the population has made no appreciable recovery (B. Luckhurst pers. comm. 2012).","",,false,false,Global

Historically, this species was moderately common off Tunisia and Malta, and rare off France, Algeria and Italy. It now appears to be mostly restricted to one small part of the Mediterranean Sea, the Sicilian channel around Malta Island, which is subject to heavy trawling activity. In the 1990s, surveys no longer detected this skate in the Gulf of Lion. It was extremely rare in the western central Mediterranean Sea (the coasts of Tyrrhenia, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily) according to the International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean from 1994 to 1999 (i.e., recorded in 20 of 6,336 hauls). It is now more rare off Malta and rare or absent off Tunisia. Maltese Skate is assessed as Critically Endangered under criteria&#160;A2bcd+3bcd as a result of a suspected population size reduction of at least 80% over a three generation period (15 years), based upon its endemism to the region, inferred reduction in the area of occupancy, and inferred population reductions off the Maltese, Tunisian and French coasts. The population is also suspected to continue declining around 80% in the future over the period of three generations. More research is needed on its range, biology, ecology, exploitation, and abundance.</span></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">This benthic skate occurs over sandy and sandy-muddy bottoms at depths of 60−<span lang=""en-GB"">800 m, but most commonly 400−<span lang=""en-GB"">800 m.   <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">Little is known about the reproductive cycle of this skate. Breeding occurs throughout the year, though ovulating females have mainly been observed in the spring and autumn (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Serena 2005). Females produce 10−<span lang=""en-GB"">56 eggs per year (Bauchot 1987). Both males and females mature at ~40 cm total length (TL; Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo and Bianchi 1998), and the maximum reported size is ~50 cm TL (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984). In Italian waters, the size range of this species was reported to be 9−<span lang=""en-GB"">42 cm TL between 1985 and 2001 (Ragonese <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2003). Its generation length is suspected to be 4-5 years.</span></span></p></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">The majority of this species’ geographic (i.e., in the Sicilian Strait around Malta) and depth (400−<span lang=""en-GB"">800 m) range occurs where trawling activity is intensive. The Sicilian Channel is the most exploited region of the Italian coast with respect to the total number of fishing vessels of any kind compared to other parts of the basin. Most of the fleet is composed of multipurpose artisanal vessels using bottom longlines, gillnets and trammel nets, all gear types that are likely to catch this species. Trawl fishing vessels constitute 11% of the fleet (Relini <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2000). While this skate is not known to be targeted by commercial fisheries, it is taken as bycatch in bottom trawl, gillnet, and bottom longline fisheries and often discarded (Ragonese <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2003). Skates generally have low commercial value in the Mediterranean region, but o<span lang=""en-GB"">ccasionally this species is present in fish markets. Usually only the large individuals are landed for human consumption, however, there is full retention of all size classes in the cod-end of gears currently used, regardless of mesh size (Ragonese <em>et al. </em>2001). <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">Along the Tunisian coast, this species is occasionally caught as bycatch in bottom trawl, gillnet, and bottom longline fisheries, but it is now extremely rare in this area (Bauchot 1987). Maltese fisheries using bottom longline and trawl gear may take this species as bycatch (De Leiva <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 1998), although Maltese fishing fleets are smaller to those of the Italians’. Tunisian fisheries are small, coastal and probably operate outside this species’ area of occurrence (Samira 2002).  </span></p> <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">Benthic trawling effort over the continental shelf and slope in the Mediterranean Sea increased with respect to fishing effort and technological advances over a period of 60 years, although it is unclear if fishing effort will continue to increase within this species range. Fishing effort and catches should be monitored closely.</span></p></span></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">This is one of only four skate species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, and has undergone significant declines and a reduction in its geographical range. Historically, its range once extended over about one quarter of the total area of the Mediterranean Sea (at least within the depth range of the main trawl fisheries). It was moderately common off Tunisia, common around Malta, rare off Algeria and recorded once off Italy (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984). The range of this skate now appears to be restricted to the Sicilian Channel (Pipitone <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 1992, Relini 1995, Cannavò <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 1999), and it is considered rare off Malta (Schembri <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2003) and rare or absent off Tunisia (Bradaï 2000). In Italian waters, trawl surveys performed by Gruppo Nazionale risorse Demersali<span lang=""en-GB""> (GRUND) between 1985 and 2000 only recorded this species in the Sicilian Channel (20 of 23 hauls in this area;  Relini <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2000, Ragonese <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2003).   <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">In surveys conducted in the northern Mediterranean Sea from the Alboran to Aegean Sea (including off Sicily), the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) recorded this species in only 20 out of 6,336 hauls between 1994 and 1999 (Bertrand <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2000, Baino <span lang=""en-GB""><em>et al</em><span lang=""en-GB"">. 2001). In this area, the standing stock biomass of this species was estimated to be 705 tonnes. If the average weight of an individual is ~2 kg, the estimated population size in the MEDITS survey area was ~35,200 individuals at this time (note that this does not include any remaining population around Malta and North Africa).  </span></span></p> <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">Records from surveys of the Gulf of Lion infer that this species was present on the continental shelf in 1957−<span lang=""en-GB"">1960 and slope in 1980−<span lang=""en-GB"">1984, but not in comparable surveys carried out in 1992−19<span lang=""en-GB"">95 (Aldebert 1997). However, caution should be taken with these findings because the species could be confused with Cuckoo Skate (<span lang=""en-GB""><em>Leucoraja naevus</em><span lang=""en-GB"">),<span lang=""en-GB""> which is widespread in the western part of the Mediterranean Sea.  </span></span></span></span></p> <p> <span lang=""en-GB"">In a recent study, bottom trawl hauls of commercial vessels operating in the Aegean Sea were analysed three times per year from 1995 to 2000 and 2003 to 2006 (Damalas and Vassilopoulou 2011). A mean nominal catch per unit effort declined by 50% in the number of individuals (from 0.22 to 0.11 individuals per haul) and by 60% in weight (from 0.05 to 0.02 kilograms per haul) between the two time frames.

The most appropriate management measure may be to define areas of suitable habitat for this species that are also unsuitable for bottom trawling and close them to trawl fisheries in order to protect part of the population and the eggs from exploitation (Ragonese <em>et al. </em>2003).</span></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"

The CPUE decreased by approximately 80% from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s in the northern South China Sea. There was a recorded total catch decline of over 90% in the East China Sea over the same time period. The catch numbers in Taiwan and Korea also declined by these high proportions. The numbers have not recovered since the crash in the 1980s despite restocking and management efforts such as spawning ground protection and nursery area protection. The generation length of this species is  approximately 15.5 years, and the declines in the global population are inferred to be approximately 80-95% (over three generation lengths ~47 years). As there is no evidence that this species is being sustainably exploited, it is listed as Critically Endangered under A2bd.","<em>Larimichthys crocea</em> inhabits coastal waters and estuaries and lives down to about 100 m; it is mostly found around 60 m depth over soft muddy, or sandy substrate. Adults and juveniles share the same habitats. It mainly feeds on benthic fishes and crustaceans.<br/><br/>This species forms spawning aggregations in shallow coastal waters (less than 30 m) in spring and/or autumn and gathered in offshore deeper waters (50-80 m) in winter as water temperatures in shallow waters decline (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Therefore, the species periodically moves between spawning and over-wintering grounds (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). About 9 spawning aggregation grounds were identified along the coastal waters of mainland China in the East and South China Seas. Along the coastal waters of mainland China from north to south, the main spawning season varied; in the north, spring was the main spawning season, and in the south it was autumn. The species has high fecundity with ripe females peaking at a GSI of 30% and the ability of a single female to produce millions of eggs in a spawning season. This species is reported to mature at around 22-25 cm SL (1950s) but more recently at&#160; &lt;20 cm SL (1980s). The maximum reported age for this species is&#160;29 years (1950s) and is more commonly reported from 5-12 year (1980/90s).&#160;<br/><br/>The sex ratio of this species shifted from 1:2 in 1960 to 1:1.&#160;In the survey of the Yellow Sea and the East Sea, the recorded length range was 30-200 mm, with an average of 97 mm.&#160;In China, the stock spawns mainly in spring but also during autumn.  The spawning grounds are generally located near the estuaries with a low salinity (27~31 ppt), with a 20 m depth and above, visibility no more than 1 m, flow rate no less than 1.2 m/s, and a temperature around 16~22℃. After spawning, the fish generally swim towards the outer sea to feed, and the juveniles move from shallow to deep water. With the lowering water temperature, adult fish and juvenile swim towards deep water (J.H. Cheng pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is about 15.5 years. This was calculated using the following equation: Age at first maturity + (max age - age at first maturity) / 2<br/><br/>Some studies showed there were some differences in morphological characteristics between the artificial cage-cultured population compared with wild population; the proportion of eye diameter to head length, as well as the proportion of body height to standard body length of cultured population are larger (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, the proportions of snout length to head length and postorbital length to head length of cage-cultured population are smaller than that of the wild population. Furthermore, the results showed that the proportions of eye diameter to head length, snout length to head length and head length to standard body length of cultured population decreased as the sizes of the standard body length increased. The regression equations of body length and weight, body length and culture period, can be indicated as W=0.0195L 2.9775 (R2=0. 9959), y=-0.0259x 2+1.7125x+4.1534(R2=0.989). The proportion of swim bladder weight to body weight is from 0.61% up to 2.26%, and the monthly average of swim bladder weight index is ranged from 1.08% to 1.85%.","<em>Larimichthys crocea </em>is&#160;heavily exploited throughout its range. Evidence strongly suggests that a combination of heavy exploitation of spawning and over-wintering aggregations, poor management, and over fishing pressure were major factors in stock declines, with contributions from pollution, habitat degradation and marine ecosystem shift (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Due to the rarity of the species in the wild in recent years, the prices of wild fish are much higher than those of maricultured fish in mainland China (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Mariculture of the species in mainland China is one of the most successful marine fishes; the mariculture production of the species remained at about 60 t in recent years (FAO dataset). Due to its longer life span and late sexual maturity, this fish has difficulty recovering after heavy exploitation. Wild stocks of the species showed low genetic diversity. The genetic diversity is even lower in maricultured fish. Prevention of the escape of maricultured fish and suspension of restocking programs are needed as these have facilitated inbred generations from hatcheries.<br/>&#160;  <br/>The prices of the species, wild-caught, were relatively cheap between the 1950s and the 1970s, and the species was one of the most common marine fishes consumed in mainland China. However, due to the rarity of the species in the wild in the recent years, the prices of wild fish are much higher, about 1000~1500 yuan per 500 g (USD 50-60 per kg) (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Due to the high demand and this species' inability to recover fast, it is over fishing that is its greatest threat.&#160;<br/><br/>The major threats to the species are over-exploitation of the spawning and over-wintering aggregations with excess catch volumes (i.e. far exceeded the estimated maximum sustainable yields) and efforts throughout its geographic region, including mainland China and South Korea between the 1950s and 1980s (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).&#160;The species was heavily targeted by drag seine nets in all known spawning aggregation grounds, in shallow waters from the 1950s to 1970s and then shifted to trawling operations in over-wintering aggregation grounds in deeper waters in the 1970s and 1980s. These led to the complete disappearance of aggregations of the species in the late-1980s, particularly in the East China Sea.","In Japan, reported landings decreased from 1985 to present, with a increase in production from 2004-2011 (Japanese Fisheries Agency unpublished data). In mid-western Taiwan, monitoring data do not report this species since 2003 (M.-H. Chen pers. comm. 2016). In Fujian Province, mainland China, catches are very low in monitoring surveys since 2013 (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Cheung and Pitcher (2008) showed the CPUE of&#160;<em>L. crocea</em>&#160;has declined about 80% from mid-1970s to late 80s in the northern South China Sea. This species has been heavily exploited since the 1950s, and wild stocks were severely depleted by the 1980s that most individuals subsequently sold had originated from hatcheries. After peaking at about 200,000t in the mid-1970s, catches of the croaker in China declined by over 90% within two decades.&#160;The population densities of the species in the geographic region are unknown. However, according to its capture volumes, the species was considerably abundant and common between the 1950s and 1970s, particularly in the East China Sea (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). <br/><br/>Mainland China accounted for about 90% of the global total capture volumes of the species from the 1950s to the 1970s, with catches mainly from the East China Sea (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).  By the late 1980s, the crucial seasonal fishery of this species had completely disappeared throughout the region. Since the 1990s, the catch volumes have increased; however, the catch volumes are only derived from the capture reports from mainland China. The catches in South Korea have been no longer significant since the 1990s. The capture volume increase since the 1990s is probably over-reported (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). The wild stocks of the species have not recovered after various management measures, from protecting spawning and juvenile nursery grounds, long-term restocking, and developing hatchery-based mariculture.&#160;<br/><br/>The total catches (including the East and South China Seas, and the Yellow Sea) of the species from mainland China declined by 98% between 1974 (the peak year with about 200,000 t) and 1990 (less than 10 t). In the East China Sea, the catches declined by 99% during the same period (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008).&#160;The catches from mainland China and South Korea were mainly from both of the spawning aggregations formed by this species. Since the 1980s, the spawning aggregations have completely disappeared in all spawning grounds and the same applies for the over-wintering aggregations.<br/><br/>Several biological changes in the species have been identified and are probably associated with over exploitation in several heavily fished spawning grounds (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Age and size at sexual maturation at exploited spawning and over-wintering grounds declined between the 1950s and 1990s. The species grew faster (i.e. became longer and heavier at the same age) at heavily exploited spawning grounds as fishing pressure increased from the 1950s to 1980s. Genetic diversity in wild stocks was low.<br/><br/>The catch of Large Yellow Croaker in the East Sea accounted for more than 98% of the total catch until the 1980s. Before 1975, the catch of this species was about 19.6×10⁴t.  Because of the overfishing, the number of Large Yellow Croaker&#160;is much lower, and the stock has been damaged. In the 1990s, the average catches is about 0.9×10⁴t; in recent years, the annual catch is less than 1000t (J.H. Cheng pers comm. 2016) According to the large-scale research between 1997 and 2000, there are a few larger yellow croakers in the East China Sea, and there are more outside the Dasha fishing ground and the Wentai fishing ground. This species is rare in Taiwan.",Decreasing,"<em>Larimichthys crocea </em>is found along the coast of China from the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and northern South China Sea. It has also been reported off the southern tip of South Korea, along western Taiwan, and Hong Kong (K. Sasaki pers. comm. 2016). The depth range for this species is 10 to 100 m.","This is one of the most important stocks in China, and the main targeted stock in the East Sea and the South China Sea. There are various fishing methods such as trawl net, purse seine, drift nets, etc. As landings have declined historically, there has been increased effort to cultivate this species; upwards of 100,000 tonnes are now produced annually in mainland China (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Large Yellow Croaker is nutrient-rich and has high economic value. There are dozens of cooking styles, including braising, stewed, fried and salted, etc.  Pickled large yellow croaker is one of the hospitality dishes for Zhoushan people. This species is also highly regarded for its traditional medical value.",Marine,"Various management measures have been applied to protect <em>L. crocea</em>&#160;in mainland China between the 1950s and 1980s, including fishing gear control, fishing effort input control, seasonal closure, spawning and juvenile nursery ground protection (see Table 2 in Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). Despite the various management measures, the wild stocks of this species have not recovered, suggesting insufficient, inefficient, and untimely measures. <br/><br/>Large scale and long term restocking programs of the species have been applied in the East China Sea, mainland China from as soon as hatchery was successful in the 1980s (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson, 2008, and references cited). However, the wild stocks of the species did not show recovery in the East China Sea. Urgent research and conservation are needed for the species. The extensive Mainland China government-sponsored mariculture programs introduced to address food supply and over fishing in the 1980s, particularly of the croaker, was one of the earliest for marine fin fish, not only in China PR but globally. Although&#160;<em>L. crocea</em> proved a highly successful mariculture candidate, with approximately 70,000 tonnes produced in 2005, the highest of any marine fish cultured in China PR, mariculture and restocking have failed to restore croaker stocks and may have, inadvertently, led to biodiversity losses. The detailed history of the croaker is a sobering reminder that successful mariculture, albeit important for food production and livelihoods, is not necessarily a solution to over fishing, and moreover, may have compromised fishery recovery by competing for funds, attention, space, and maybe genetic resources (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2008). <br/>&#160;<br/>In China after the 1970s, because of the resources recession, the government and the fisheries management set many protection measures. For example, in 1981 fishing was prohibited between 5-7th in Lusi fishing ground (32-34°N, 122°30′) and trawling for Large Yellow Croaker was prohibited. Fujian Province has published the regulations for the feeding protection, prohibit fishing the Large Yellow Croaker&#160;in Guanjinyang spawning ground, and set up mobile and set-operation for fishing ban period of&#160; about 1-3 months. In the original Sino-Japanese Fishery Agreement, the original fish line has been extrapolated 30 miles, set up some protection, and between 4-6th fishing is prohibited. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian provinces prohibit fishing for 2-3 months in summer.  However, the effect is unsatisfactory (J.H. Cheng pers comm 2016).&#160;Zhejiang province has released artificial breeding individuals in Zhejiang coastal waters from 1998. During 1998-2003, the total number released is 623.6×10⁴, with 5-10 cm in length.","",,false,false,Global
49318282,161463,Rhinoptera marginata,Critically Endangered,A2d,2021,2020-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Lusitanian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera marginata</em>) is a large benthopelagic (to 200 cm disc width) ray that occurs in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, from Portugal to northern Angola. It is found from nearshore to a depth of 100 m.<br/><br/>The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, purse seines, and gillnets. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally and internationally as a dried and smoked or fresh and frozen product. This species forms large schools, meaning that large numbers can be fished in a single haul and there is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across its range, with demand for shark and ray product increasing.<br/><br/>It is apparently uncommon across most of the western and central Mediterranean but more common in the eastern region (Levantine basin), where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing. In West Africa, this species is still commonly caught in several countries, but significant population declines have been reported. In this region, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other large species of rays, and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been reduced in numbers in that area. Heavy fishing pressure has caused declines in other Rhinopterids.<br/><br/>Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray and there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries in several countries. The species is susceptible to fisheries, has schooling behaviour, limited productivity (one pup per year), and there are noted declines in other large rays (e.g., eagle rays) across its range. It is suspected that the Lusitanian Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (83 years) based on actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is a benthopelagic ray that occurs inshore over sandy substrates in shallow bays, lagoons and estuaries, from nearshore to a depth of 100 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm disc width (DW),&#160;males mature at 64–77 cm DW and females mature at&#160;66–80 cm DW&#160;(Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Tirasin and Basusta 2018). Reproduction is&#160;lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of one pup, a gestation period of one year and size-at-birth of 23&#160;cm DW&#160;(Valadou&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Last<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 14.3 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The Lusitanian Cownose Ray&#160;has a larger maximum size than the&#160;Cownose Ray (200 cm vs 104 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 27.5 years for the Lusitanian Cownose Ray. Cownose rays are among the least productive elasmobranchs with an  estimated intrinsic rate of population growth rates (r) ranging from 0.018 yr−1 to 0.032 yr−1 (median r = 0.008) (Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).","The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including, gill net, trawl, trammel net, seine nets, longline, and hook and line (Schneider 1990). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted. Its schooling behaviour in shallow water makes it particularly susceptible to target fisheries (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). For example, inshore fisheries in Brazilian waters have driven the Brazilian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>) to local extinction, indicating that comparable fisheries operating in Mediterranean waters could pose a similar threat to the Lusitanian Cownose Ray.<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Lusitanian Cownose Ray is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch. This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonart and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras <em>et al</em>. 2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho et al. 2014, Kyne et al. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes as well as longlines and handlines (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, G.H.L. Leurs I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In Mauritania, the Lusitanian Cownose Rays was caught as bycatch in the 1990s and early 2000s during the 'courbine' (<em>Argyrosomus regius</em>) fishing season and, like other species of sharks and rays, was processed salted and dried (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). However, when an export market developed around 2007 with Spain, targeted artisanal fisheries for this species emerged. Fishers increasingly used drift nets to capture this species at known aggregations sites. Peak landings occurred between March and May, corresponding to the breeding season of females that were caught pregnant with near term embryos (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. For example, in West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries and destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., for rice and salt production) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific trend data on the population of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray. However, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, this species is apparently rare in the western and central regions and was historically infrequently encountered off the coast of Dalmatia (Marchesetti 1882, Faber 1883) and sometimes observed in the fish markets of Mallorca in Spain (Barceló and Combis 1868). More recently, it was only recorded in two (in the eastern Ionian Sea) of a total 6,336 hauls in scientific trawl survey data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) programme conducted between 1994–1999 at depths of 10–800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). However, it was not recorded in trawl surveys in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea between 1972–2004 or in the Adriatic Sea between 1948–2005 (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2013). Within the Mediterranean Sea, even historically anecdotal evidence indicates that it appeared to be most abundant in the Levantine basin (Doderlein 1884). It is considered common off Israel and reported from Turkey, Syria, Cyprus, and Egypt (Dieuzeide <em>et al</em>. 1953, Bilecenoğlu <em>et al</em>. 2002, Golani 2006, Hadjichristophorou 2006, Saad <em>et al</em>. 2006, Basusta <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species has a schooling behavior and 129 individuals were captured (of which 36 females were gravid) in one purse seiner haul in Turkey in 2013 (Tirasin and Basusta 2018). The schooling behavior of this species, local declines of other Rhinopterids (e.g., the Brazilian Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>) which has declined in southern Brazil as a result of intensive inshore fisheries) (Vooren and Lamónaca 2004), and the high levels of exploitation across the eastern Mediterranean suggest a population reduction in the Mediterranean portion of this species' range. <br/><br/>Second, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria, Mauritania, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. <br/><br/>Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly et al. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Fourth, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Lusitanian Cownose Ray still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, targeted seasonal fisheries for this species have developed in the last 15 years to supply meat for local consumption and the export market to Ghanaian traders (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). While limited species-specific information is available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically abundant in many West African countries but that targeted fisheries and its schooling behavior has led to severe declines in quantities landed (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). This species was considered to be one of the most commonly landed species in Mauritania in early 2000 (Valadou <em>et al</em>. 2006). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004–2006, this species was present in 0.8% of the total catches and contributed 0.1% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). In regular fisheries monitoring surveys undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin, landings peaked at 1,104 t in 2012 but gradually decreased to 393 t in 2019 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent of &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray (83 years). Between 2004–2011, this species represented one of the most common species recorded in Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone during landing site surveys (Diop and Dossa 2011). In Senegal, large quantities are now only seen at trade centers in Casamance and are likely originating from various countries (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, this species was only occasionally recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 as single individuals or small numbers except on one occasion in 2015 where 961 individuals were recorded on drying racks in Gunjur and Ghanatown with less than 1% of this catch likely to be mature (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Guinea-Bissau (surveys restricted to Bijagos Archipelago), this species is still sometimes recorded in markets, however, it appears to only be captured in certain locations (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 but information on quantities is not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research surveys, during landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020, or in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (P. Doherty, K. Metcalfe, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other Myliobatiformes (Duckbill Eagle Ray (<em>Aetomylaeus bovinus</em>), Whitepotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>), and Common Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis aquila</em>)), represented 0.01% of rays captured while it was rarely recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets (two individuals in Libreville in November 2018) (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). There, observers onboard industrial vessels report large quantities representing hundreds of individuals captured and covering the whole deck of trawlers in one haul (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, during surveys between January and December 2019, individuals were landed on a monthly basis but in low numbers (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). However, visits to landing sites in the past indicate that trawlers caught large quantities of adults of almost 150 cm total length seasonally (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, there are no records from opportunistic landing surveys but fishers were able to recognize the species during interviews. They noted that they were common in the past (20 years ago) but had now become rare and when caught, they were only in small sizes while younger fishers (less than 30 years old) were not able to identify the species (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray and anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically abundant in many West African countries but has severely declined. There has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing and population reductions are suspected. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries in several countries. Based on susceptibility to fisheries, its schooling behavior, limited productivity, and noted declines in other large rays (e.g., eagle rays) in general across its range, it is suspected that the Lusitanian Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (83 years) based on actual or potential levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Lusitanian Cownose Ray is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and occurs from Portugal to northern Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). It is not present in the Black Sea and has not been recorded from Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Cownose rays are generally caught as utilized bycatch of artisanal and industrial fisheries but are also sometimes targeted in West Africa for the trade in meat (Tagliafico <em>et al</em>. 2012; M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). It is of little commercial importance for human consumption in the Mediterranean region. However, in some areas of West Africa, the meat is utilised fresh, salted, dried or smoked for human consumption and also for animal feed (e.g., Ghana) (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). Since 2007–2008, an export market for fresh and frozen meat of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray developed between Mauritania, Senegal, and Spain which has led fishers in West Africa to increasingly target this species (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). In Mauritania, salted and dried wings are also exported to Central Africa by Ghanaians and Cameroonians (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the range of the Lusitanian Cownose Ray have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking this species are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of its range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

The species is dependent on regular freshwater influxes, which have become more sporadic due to human alterations and water mismanagement in the region, leading to a decline in mature individuals. The species has been listed as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(i)b due to a continued decline in habitat quality and the absence of mature individuals in the latest intensive surveys. It is also likely that there are less than 250 animals in total and 50 mature individuals or less in each estuarine subpopulation, with extreme fluctuations. Until a programme is in place that regulates freshwater pulses into South African estuaries, which are needed to maintain the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. watermeyeri</span> food supply, the species will likely remain at high risk of extinction. Population and habitat monitoring are needed.&#160;</p>","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Syngnathus watermeyeri&#160;</span>occurs in&#160;brackish, tidal areas of estuaries and is found primarily in association with the eelgrass&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Zostera capensis&#160;</span>and the aquatic macrophyte <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ruppia cirrhosa</span>, where it feeds almost exclusively on zooplankton (Whitfield 1995). The species undergoes large fluctuations depending on macrophyte presence or absence, and generally is only found when they are present (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The species is ovoviviparous, and the male carries the eggs in a brood pouch which is found under the tail (Breder and Rosen&#160;1966). Sexual maturity is attained at approximately 10 cm standard length with males retaining up to 44 embryos (Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2014). Reproductively active specimens were collected in the Kariega estuary during late September (Whitfield 1995).<strong><br/></strong>","<em>Syngnathus watermeyeri</em> relies on freshwater pulses which provide the nutrients that enable phytoplankton development and, together with particulate organic material brought down by the rivers, support the zooplankton community upon which these pipefish depend for food. The construction of dams and other impoundments have caused a deprivation of fresh water pulses and a subsequent decline in food supply (Whitfield 1995). Dry conditions in the late 1900s and early 2000s, together with excessive freshwater abstraction from the catchment, caused the Kariega river to stop flowing, which probably contributed to the absence of <em>S. watermeyeri</em> from this system during this period (A.K.Whitfield pers. comm. 13 March 2017).<br/><br/>This species may also be particularly susceptible to hypersaline conditions and to large flood events (Vorwerk <em>et al</em>. 2007). A flood event in the East Kleinemonde estuary in 1996 (Cowley 1998) resulted in the apparent localized extinction of <em>S. watermeyeri</em>. This was thought to be the result of primary <em>S. watermeyeri</em> habitat, submerged <em>Ruppia cirrhosa </em>beds, being flushed out to sea (Vorwerk <em>et al</em>. 2007). A similar occurrence of <em>Zostera capensis </em>destruction in the Kariega estuary during 2012 caused the demise of recovering estuarine pipefish populations in this system (A.K.

Between 1989 and 1992, intensive surveys were conducted in all three estuaries with no specimens recorded. As a result, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">S. watermeyeri </span>was listed as officially Extinct in the 1994 IUCN Red List but in 1996 a new breeding population was discovered in the East Kleinemonde estuary (Cowley 1998).

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore (including the intertidal zone) to depths of 120 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Sharpnose Guitarfish has litter sizes of 6-18 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Sharpnose Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all giant guitarfishes in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Sharpnose Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Sharpnose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific).

Moazzam pers. comm, 07/02/2019); size at birth is ~39 cm TL (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<em><em></em></em>  <p>Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes&#160;are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Sharpnose Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010),&#160;and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) and Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Sharpnose Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g., Moore <em>et al. </em>2012) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. All of the historical accounts, and one of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Sharpnose Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g. 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed. One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish&#160;and Halavi Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus</em>&#160;<em>halavi</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Sharpnose Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish (<em>G. obtusus</em>). Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98-99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Sharpnose Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Sharpnose Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (<em>G. typus</em>) and Clubnose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for the Sharpnose Guitarfish, with a decline of 94% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).&#160;&#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Additionally, during research trawl surveys in United Arab Emirates (UAE) waters, the Sharpnose Guitarfish was the most common guitarfish in 2002, but was not captured during similar surveys in 2016&#160;(Edwin Grandcourt, pers. comm., 08/02/17).&#160;</p><p>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Sharpnose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia).

While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and is a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, and Iran. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>  <p></p><p><br/></p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span>","",,false,false,Global

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore (including the inter-tidal zone and estuarine reaches of rivers) to depths of at least 100 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Giant Guitarfish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Giant Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all giant guitarfishes in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Giant Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Giant Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). While parts of Australasia provide refuge from intense fishing effort, this proportion of the species’ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. It is inferred that the&#160;Giant Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.<p>&#160;</p>","The Giant Guitarfish occurs from close inshore (including the inter-tidal zone and estuarine reaches of rivers) to depths of at least 100 m on the continental shelf (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Although juveniles and adults are known to co-occur within inshore coastal habitats, embayments and coral reef atolls, neonates and juveniles are more common within shallow areas, including the inter-tidal zone. Upon reaching sexual maturity, the species undergoes an apparent change in habitat use as they become less frequent within inshore waters and only return to these areas on a seasonal basis, exhibiting philopatry presumably for reproductive behaviours (Gutteridge 2012, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014b). Maximum size is at least 270 cm total length (TL); males and females mature at 150–180 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous; litter size is unknown but giant guitarfishes have small litters; size at birth is 38–40 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b). Age at maturity is estimated at 6–8 years for males and females; maximum age is 19 years (250 cm TL female) (White 2014, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014a), but is likely higher since the species reaches at least 270 cm TL. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Giant Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).&#160;Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example (just outside the range of the Giant Guitarfish), the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010),&#160;and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004) and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Giant Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka (Lack and Sant 2011).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides some refuge for this species. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is however unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g., Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2002, White <em>et al.</em> 2013). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017). Southeast Asia for example has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Three of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Giant Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) and Halavi Guitarfish (<em>G. halavi</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish (<em>G. obtusus</em>). Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98–99% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish and Clubnose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Landings declined by 86% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Giant Guitarfish (45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>The one region in which the Giant Guitarfish may be in a better state than most of their range is Australia, where fishing effort is relatively low, Turtle Exclusion Devices reduce catches of large rays by 94% (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), and there are controls on their catch and retention. Estimates of fishing mortality rates in the Northern Prawn Fishery (the main fishery to interact with this species) for this, and similar species, are well below those that would lead to significant population declines (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). The Giant Guitarfish remains a common inshore and coastal batoid of northern Australia (e.g., Vaudo and Heithaus 2009).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Giant Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands provide some refuge for the species, however, this proportion of the species’ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. Overall, it is inferred that the Giant Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Giant Guitarfish<em>&#160;</em>is widespread in the Eastern Indian and Western Pacific Oceans, where it occurs from India to Australia (where it is widespread across the north of the continent), Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and north to Taiwan (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b).","<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. The exception for this species is Australia where the Giant Guitarfish is generally not utilized or traded. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data), and the snout of giant guitarfishes are considered a delicacy in Singapore where they are steamed and the gelatinous filling consumed.</p>",Marine,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for giant guitarfishes.&#160;A finning ban, general fisheries management, and&#160;marine protected areas likely benefit this species in Australia.<br/><br/>In Australia, finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) is prohibited. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. Queensland has a recreational possession limit of one shark or ray, and the Northern Territory a possession limit of three. In the major prawn trawl fisheries of northern and eastern Australia, the bycatch of large elasmobranchs has been significantly reduced since 2000 with the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in trawl nets (e.g., Brewer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).

The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Bottlenose Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light.&#160;Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Bottlenose Wedgefish has litter sizes of 7-19 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a> are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade.

It occurs over soft substrates,&#160;but can also be associated with coral reefs. Maximum size is ~300 cm total length (TL); males mature at 110-130 cm TL; females mature at ~155 cm TL (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).

There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bottlenose Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).&#160;Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Oman (19,000 artisanal boats), Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Barrowclift&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Bottlenose Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g. White and Dharmadi 2007, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides some refuge for this species. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g. Stobutzki <em>et al. </em>2002, White <em>et al. </em>2013). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In northern Australia, wedgefish account for a minor component of the IUU fishing. The IUU activity peaked in the mid-2000s, and although vessel numbers have declined since then, there is still some illegal fishing in the region (Field&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Marshall 2011, Harward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;</em>was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that <em>R. djiddensis</em> is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is worth noting that recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea recorded only a single individual <em>Rhynchobatus&#160;</em>(Tirtadanu <em>et al.</em> 2018), and in the North Natuna Sea (which is north of the Java Sea), trawl surveys recorded only two individuals (Yusup <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish', 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed. One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (<em>Rhina ancylostoma</em>), Bottlenose Wedgefish, Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus</em><em>&#160;djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98-99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and '<em>R. djiddensis</em>', and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for '<em>R. djiddensis'</em>&#160;(i.e. Bottlenose Wedgefish and Smoothnose Wedgefish), with a decline of 87% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.</p>  <p>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish (<em>R. cooki</em>), Eyebrow Wedgefish (<em>R. palpebratus</em>), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).&#160;&#160;</p><p>The one region in which the Bottlenose Wedgefish may be in a better state than most of their range is Australia, where fishing effort is relatively low, Turtle Exclusion Devices reduce catches of large rays by 94% (Brewer <em>et al. </em>2006), and there are controls on their catch and retention. Estimates of fishing mortality rates in the Northern Prawn Fishery (the main fishery to interact with this species) for this, and similar species, are well below those that would lead to significant population declines (Zhou and Griffiths 2008).</p>  <p>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and the above information can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Australia and Papua New Guinea provide some refuge for the species, however, this proportion of the species’ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. Overall, it is inferred that the Bottlenose Wedgefish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Bottlenose Wedgefish is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific from Mozambique through the Western Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, Southeast Asia, and extending north to Taiwan, south to Australia (where it is wide-ranging across the north of the continent), and east to the Solomon Islands (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Hylton <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue. The Bottlenose Wedgefish was&#160;listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 2017 which aims to provide a framework for the coordination of measures adopted by Range States to improve the conservation of the species.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">India has protected&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;since 2001 under Schedule 1 of the&#160;<em>Wildlife (Protection) Act</em>&#160;<em>of 1972&#160;</em>making its capture, landing, and trade illegal (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;The reclassification of wedgefishes (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016) indicated that <em>R. djiddensis</em> does not occur in India, but the species present there are&#160;<em>R. australiae</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>R. laevis</em>, which are currently not listed under the Act.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The&#160;<em>Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012</em>&#160;protects&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;under Schedule I, but again, the species occurring in Bangladesh are&#160;<em>R. australiae</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>R. laevis </em>(Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively),&#160;Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, Israel, and Australia. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS.

Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.

68783461,18903491,Dipturus intermedius,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Flapper Skate (<em>Dipturus intermedius</em>) is a large (to at least 254 cm total length) skate that was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of northwestern Europe. It occurs from Scandinavia to the Celtic Sea, possibly extending as far north as Iceland, at depths of 20–1,500 m but the southern limits of the distribution are uncertain. The range has contracted from most inshore areas of its former distribution, but it is still caught in Scottish waters, especially around the Shetland and Orkney Islands and off northwest Scotland, and in very low numbers along the shelf edge and occasionally in the Celtic Sea. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch of multispecies trawl and tangle net fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and upper slope habitat. Fisheries data indicate that populations of <em>D. batis</em>-complex (Flapper Skate and Common Blue Skate (<em>D. batis</em>); known as the 'common skate complex') underwent an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of their range around the British Isles and Ireland since the early 20th century (within the suspected three generation period of 104 years). Fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although reported Icelandic landings of the 'common skate complex' have declined and current information showing low relative catch rates infer low population sizes. The life history and demography of this species allow little capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries; its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. This has been a prohibited species since 2009 in parts of its range and cannot be landed in European Union or United Kingdom waters. Prior to 2009, there was an inferred steep decline of the Flapper Skate in fisheries landings and an observed, but unquantified, reduction in geographic range size. It is suspected that the Flapper Skate has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (104 years) due to levels of exploitation and range reduction, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Flapper Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and slope to at depths of 20–1,500 m, although it is primarily within the 200 m depth range (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). This is the largest species of skate attaining a length of at least 254 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~185 cm TL and females mature at ~197 cm TL (Last et al. 2016). Reproduction oviparous and size-at-birth is 21–29 cm TL (Clark 1926, Iglésias <em>et al</em>. 2010, Last et al. 2016). The age and growth of the ‘common skate complex’ was reported by Du Buit (1976) and more recently by Fahy (1991) who examined the vertebrae of 75 individuals landed in Ireland. Using the age-at-length relationship determined for the ‘common skate complex’ (Du Buit 1976), the age at 50% maturity is tentatively suggested as 19–20 years for Flapper Skate and maximum age is estimated at up to 50 years. Thus, the generation length is estimated as 34.5 years.","Skates are an important component of the demersal fisheries of northwest Europe and the Flapper Skate has traditionally been landed due to its large size (Holden 1977). It has been caught in targeted fisheries where and when abundant, and as a bycatch elsewhere within its range. Given that this species is likely to be taken in trawl and gillnet, and tangle net fisheries that target high-value teleosts (e.g., anglerfish (<em>Lophiiformes </em>spp.) and hake (Merlucciidae spp.)), it is unlikely that fishing effort will decrease. However, given that there are positive trends in multiple fishery-independent trawl surveys since the ‘common skate complex’ were listed as prohibited species on European Union fisheries regulations, it is possible that the current levels of fishing pressure are allowing population growth. Flapper Skate is also targeted by recreational fisheries, particularly off Scotland, where most anglers release captured individuals.<br/><br/>Worldwide capture production reported as ‘<em>D. batis</em>’, was 502 t in 2005, of which 302 t (60.2%) were landed by France (Iglésias <em>et al</em>. 2010). Given the issues of the identification of members of this family, landings of Flapper Skate can be erroneously reported as Common Blue Skate, Long-nosed Skate (<em>D. oxyrinchus</em>), and Norwegian Skate (<em>D. nidarosiensis</em>), which hampers the interpretation of landings data, which may also vary with spatio-temporal changes in fishing patterns.<br/><br/>It is likely that the Flapper Skate is more vulnerable to fishing mortality than the Common Blue Skate, because the former is significantly larger and attains sexual maturity at a later age, therefore the probability of an individual being captured, before successful reproduction is greater (Iglésias <em>et al</em>. 2010).","<p></p>Historically, the Flapper Skate was widely distributed in the seas surrounding the British Isles, although catch rates of the species in this area declined during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. By the 1970s the ‘common skate complex’ was considered locally extinct from the Irish Sea (Brander 1981) and these species also disappeared from much of the North Sea (Walker 1999, Rogers and Ellis 2000, Sguotti <em>et al</em>. 2016). Although they are now being increasingly observed in the northwestern North Sea, Flapper Skate are now only regularly observed off northern and northwestern Scotland from sea lochs to the edge of the continental shelf and in relatively low numbers in the Celtic Sea (only 8 of 1,201 ‘common skate complex’ were identified as Flapper Skate; ICES 2012a,b). Flapper Skate is less abundant than the Common Blue Skate in the Celtic Sea and Rockall Bank, but it is the more common of the two species in the shelf seas along the western and eastern coasts of Scotland (ICES 2012a,b).<br/><br/>The ‘common skate complex’ declined in North Sea trawl surveys during the 1990s and early 2000s to the extent it was unreported for several years (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2015, ICES 2020a,b). It has been observed more recently since 2010 (ICES 2020a,b). Locations of confirmed Flapper Skate in the North Sea are largely confined to the northwestern area (ICES Division 4.a), with <em>Dipturus </em>spp. occurring sporadically elsewhere in the North Sea and Skagerrak (Division 3.a) (ICES 2020a,b). The new type locality off western Scotland appears to be the area where this depleted species is now most locally abundant (Griffiths et al. 2010). Scottish fishery-independent surveys in waters west of Scotland have recorded increased catch rates of the ‘common skate complex’ since 2005 (most likely Flapper Skate), albeit still at relatively low levels, from approximately 0.1 to 0.2 individuals per 30 minutes effort to around 0.55 individuals in 2010 (see ICES 2012a, page 403, fig. 18.5d). Earlier species-specific data from Iceland indicated declining landings of the 'common skate complex'. Earlier French data appeared more stable, but those landings included landings from fisheries operating towards the edge of the continental shelf, where the population may have been concentrated.<br/><br/>Along the northern coast of Norway, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2008) caught on average of 2.2 ‘common skate complex’ specimens (most likely Flapper Skate) per km² between 1992 and 2005. The trend in mean abundance between 1994 and 2004 was relatively stable, until 2005 when there was a sharp decrease. Additionally, they reported an average bycatch of the species complex from 2000 to 2005 of 212 kg by gillnet fisheries, 73 kg by longliners, and 19 kg by ‘other’ fisheries. Williams <em>et al</em>. (2008) also recorded a relatively low number of 121 landed individuals of the species complex in Norway during this time frame. The Flapper Skate was encountered relatively frequently by the fishery-independent annual autumn bottom trawl surveys of the north Norwegian coast – though in low numbers – ranging from two individuals per survey in 1993, to seven individuals in 1997 and 1998, to zero individuals from 2003 to 2005 (see ICES 2012a, page 283, table 14.2).<br/><br/>Current levels of exploitation across the Celtic Seas, waters west of Scotland and northern North Sea, where Flapper Skate is known to occur, are not precisely known. Whilst the earlier decline indicates that fishing pressure was too high, there is the indication of improving status in recent years, following the prohibition on landing the 'common skate complex'. Overall, a population reduction of &gt;80% is suspected to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (104 years) due to earlier levels of exploitation and a reduction in its range.",Decreasing,"The exact distribution of Flapper Skate in the Northeast Atlantic is uncertain, due to taxonomic confusion. It occurs from Scandinavia to the Celtic Sea, possibly extending as far north as Iceland, but the limits of the distribution beyond the central core are uncertain (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984; ICES 2012a,b; Ebert and Stehmann 2013; Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). The distributions of the two species in the ‘common skate complex’ are not precisely known, but available data indicate a large region of overlap from northern Scotland to the Celtic Sea, including west of Ireland (Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2010, ICES 2012b). Whilst initial studies of thermal preferences suggested Flapper Skate may be the more northerly species of the ‘common skate complex’ (Griffiths et al. 2010), it has been Common Blue Skate that has been reported from Icelandic waters (ICES 2012a,b). Whilst ‘common skate complex’ has also been reported in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, as far east as the Murman coast (Andriyashev 1954; Dolgov <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b; Williams 2008), it is uncertain whether these records refer to Flapper Skate and/or Common Blue Skate, or another skate species (e.g., another <em>Dipturus </em>spp. or <em>Bathyraja </em>spp.). Dolgov <em>et al</em>. (2005a,b) reported the ‘common skate complex’ in the western Barents Sea, and whilst these may relate to Flapper Skate, given that individuals &gt;150 cm were reported, these skates may have been misidentified.","The species is used for human consumption, and although current management measures in the European Union and United Kingdom waters (the main parts of the population area) prohibit the retention of the species, it may be caught and retained elsewhere in its range.",Marine,"<p></p>European fishing vessels (and other vessels fishing in EU waters) have not been allowed to land the 'common skate complex' from Union waters of ICES Divisions 2.a and 3.a, or from Subareas 4, 6-9 since 2009. This prohibition was extended to Union waters of ICES Division 2.a and Subareas 3–4 and 6–10 from 2010 to present (Council Regulation (EU) 2020/123 of 27 January 2020).<br/><br/>Many of the other potentially relevant conservation instruments were those established for Common Blue Skate prior to the resurrection of the Flapper Skate as a valid species.<br/><br/>The 'common skate complex' is listed on several national biodiversity lists across the United Kingdom (UK), including the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act in England and Wales, the Northern Ireland Priority List of threatened species, and the Scottish Biodiversity List. These lists act as guides for decisions on where to target conservation action and associated resource investments, though they do not afford the 'common skate complex' any legal protection. In 1999, the Common Blue Skate was included on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) list. While this does not provide legal protection for either species, it included provisions to work towards European conservation legislation. Its main targets included plans to stabilize populations in refuge areas by 2004 and to facilitate the migration of animals from refuge populations to areas where they are scarce or extinct (UK Biodiversity Action Plan 1999). The Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Conservation Order (2016) listed ‘common skate’ as a designation feature for this Marine Protected Area, which is an important site for Flapper Skate; individuals tagged off the west coast of Scotland exhibited pronounced site fidelity to highly localised areas, suggesting that spatial management of such sea loch habitats may be effective (Wearmouth and Sims 2009).<br/><br/>The Common Blue Skate is listed on the list of Threatened and/or Declining Species and habitats of the Oslo and Paris (OSPAR) Conventions for the protection of the marine environment of the Northeast Atlantic (ICES 2020a).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It occurs on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 20-600 m, although it is most common at 20-120 m. It is a moderately-sized skate attaining 70 cm total length with a generation length is 9.5 years. It is caught by a variety of fishing gears in several sectors of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), mainly by otter trawls and less frequently by Danish seine and deepwater longlines. During 2000-2006, about two-thirds of the catch was retained and marketed. Parts of its range have been subject to heavy fishing pressure for many decades. One dataset shows the considerable decline of grouped 'skates' off southern New South Wales, including Longnose Skate, equating to a 93-95% population reduction over a three generation span of 28.5 years. More recent observer data from a limited, but heavily fished, area of the species' range shows the equivalent of a &gt;99.9% population reduction over three generations. Fishing effort is ongoing in these areas. These catch data suggest a category of Critically Endangered, and of concern is the small geographic range and small core depth range of the species. However, areas of its range do not receive the same level of trawl effort as where these declines were documented (e.g., Bass Strait), and so its population status may be more secure there. A priority is to determine the occurrence and status of the Longnose Skate in these areas, and in the spatial closures and marine reserves within the species' range.

It has been collected to a maximum size of 10.3 cm standard length (SL) (Hernández <em>et al.</em> 2020). It has greatly reduced eyes (Nalbant 1981, Díaz <em>et al.</em> 1987).</p><p>The species is known from two relatively stable systems in the Northwest Matanzas province of Cuba named Cueva La Pluma and Grieta Punta de Guana (a freshwater cave and an anchialine crevice, respectively), which have water temperatures that fluctuate around 25°C and salinities that range from fresh to 22 ppt (Díaz <em>et al.</em> 1987, García-Machado and Hernandez 2012). In a report from 1973, Cueva la Pluma contained a phreatic lake covered with thick organic detritus composed mostly of guano that is at the same level as the ocean, and that Grieta Punta de Guana was described as a 25 m length fissure situated along the ocean bordered by a rocky ledge with two main openings (Kornicker and Yager 1996). The biogeochemistry of individual holes/caves varies widely, with particular sensitivity to solar insolation, water flow velocities, and organic matter inputs (Hutchinson 1999, Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2011). Due to the already harsh nature of this environment, even slight changes in cave water quality can negatively affect troglobitic organisms, which have already adapted with very low metabolic rates and small size so as to efficiently use energy when oxygen and food supply are lacking (Hutchinson 1999, Bishop<em> et al.</em> 2004, Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2011, García-Machado and Hernandez 2012).</p><p>Food availability is a significant limiting factor for these cave fishes. Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that food webs in these caves may be dependent on indigenous bacterial primary production. Populations of <em>Lucifuga </em>spp. seem to remain stable throughout the year, but the populations of the invertebrates that constitute their diet fluctuate significantly (García-Machado and Hernandez 2012). The highest densities of <em>Lucifuga </em>spp. are usually observed hiding under ledges and in dark alcoves near the entrance where prey items tend to congregate (Trajano 2001). <em>Lucifuga simile</em> is an opportunistic, passive forager that primarily preys on troglobitic amphipods and mysids, but will also eat early crab larvae and shrimps (Eigenman 1909, García-Debrás and González 1999,). Vegetable matter was found in the digestive tract of the holotype of L. simile (Nalbant 1981). Populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. are significantly more abundant in caves that bats also inhabit because their guano fertilizes the water and promotes the growth of food sources for the fish (García-Debrás and González 1999). A species of the genus <em>Eleotris</em> (Sleeper Goby) has been observed to coexist with <em>L. simile</em>. The level of competition for resources with these fish is not yet known (García-Machado and Hernández 2012).&#160;</p><p> Data on the reproductive strategy of <em>L. simile</em> are limited. As for two other species of <em>Lucifuga</em> that are endemic to freshwater caves in Cuba, no breeding season is known and no embryos or juveniles have been observed. However, <em>L. simile</em> could perform similarly to <em>L. subterranea</em> with females carrying 2-15 embryos that are approximately 2.5 cm SL at birth (Eigenmann 1909). The ovaries in female fishes of the <em>Lucifuga</em> and <em>Ogilbia</em> genera are very similar, however, sexual structures of the male, though both intromittent, are different. Male fishes are characterized by the presence of an external reproductive organ anterior to the anal fin, which it uses to facilitate internal fertilization of females (Eigenmann 1909). It is thought that mating begins as soon as the female reaches maturity when the female can carry and even nourish the delivered spermatozoa within their body for long periods. Reproduction may be infrequent and fecundity relatively low, but further research is needed (Trajano 2001, García-Machado and Hernández 2012). Definitive data on the longevity of <em>L. simile</em> are unknown, but it may be inferred that <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. have a long generation length because their populations are small and there have been very few captures of juveniles or pregnant females (García-Machado and Herníndez 2012).</p>","The main threat to <em>L. simile</em> is habitat degradation by human activities. García-Machado and Hernández (2012) reported that an oil well established near Grieta Punta de Guana may be leaching hydrocarbon residuals from the exploitation of petroleum. It has been impossible to observe the recent state of this crevice since this industrial activity has made the entrance inaccessible, but continuing decline in habitat quality is inferred.<br/><br/>Groundwater abstraction associated with agricultural production occurs throughout the region. However, the direct impact of these activities on habitat stability have not been evaluated in detail.","<p>Cave-diving expeditions can be logistically challenging and dangerous to undertake, therefore population data for <em>L. simile</em> are limited. In 1970 about 42 specimens were collected from Griata Punta de Guana and about ten more during the 1980s. Also during the 1980s, four specimens were collected from Cueva La Pluma (Díaz <em>et al.</em> 1987, Ponce de Leon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Due to its uncommon occurrence, the population size may be small. Some fluctuations of abundance were noted for <em>Lucifuga dentata</em> and <em>L. subterranea</em> (Eigenmann 1909), although it has been observed that populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. tend to remain stable throughout the year (García-Machado and Hernandez 2012).<br/> <br/> The <em>Lucifuga</em> genus continues to evolve due to the discovery of new species in previously unexplored caves throughout Cuba and Bahamas. It will be difficult to grasp a complete understanding of the populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. until a more detailed picture of their diversity and distribution is realized (Møller <em>et al</em>. 2006, García-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hernández <em>et al.</em> 2020). Møller <em>et al</em>.

The threats of ongoing habitat degradation by human activities within the extremely limited distribution require the attention of conservationists. Since species diversity for the <em>Lucifuga</em> genus is likely underestimated due to the incomplete exploration of their highly fragmented distribution, implementing conservation could be difficult without a more complete list of specific holes/caves that currently harbour populations (García-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011). Proudlove (2001) reported that most <em>Lucifuga</em> species listed as threatened or more are not receiving necessary conservation attention.<br/> <br/> Habitat management, monitoring, education, and economic activities surrounding subterranean cave systems should be considered during the planning process (García-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011, García-Machado and Hernández 2012).

These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Severe reductions of guitarfishes have occurred elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific due to fishing pressure. The Brown Guitarfish is subject to intense fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range and there is serious concern for its ability to sustain historic and current levels of fishing pressure.

This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Brown Guitarfish is subject to heavy fishing pressure on its coastal and shelf habitats across its entire range. It is captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline and is retained for the meat and fins. Across the broader Indo-Pacific region, guitarfish species are often targeted and are heavily exploited and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Taiwan, fishing is occurring in inshore areas in a potential nursery area at Penghu Island where most of the Brown Guitarfish landings are of gravid females with near-term embryos, which is of concern (P. Kyne pers. comm. 28/08/2019).</p>  <p></p>    <p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Brown Guitarfish. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017).</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019a).</p>  <p>In the Republic of Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). </p>  <p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Helgil 2019b). </p>  <p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation. <a name=""_Hlk35497192""></a>In the East China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands (Heileman and Tang 2009).</p>","<p>The Brown Guitarfish is rarely captured in Japan and is very rare in the Republic of Korea. It has dramatically declined in Republic of Korea where it was observed at fish markets and on fishing vessels 20–25 years ago but is now never seen. There used to be targeted guitarfish fisheries in Republic of Korea but rhinobatids are now rarely seen (C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the abundance of Brown Guitarfish has declined by 60–80% over the past 15–20 years at Penghu Island; previous landings of 50 or more individuals have now declined to 10–20 individuals (P.

This represents a decline of 75–96% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/></p>  <p>In Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. </p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011).  </p><p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) of the Brown Guitarfish, they represent declines of 63%, 88%, 40%, and 90% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. </p>  <p>Additionally, elsewhere where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Historical accounts and contemporary datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in guitarfishes) in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81–99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, Kyne and Ebert 2019, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra, India (63% decline for a 15-year period) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009, Kyne and Ebert 2019, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>  <p>Inferred population declines of the Brown Guitarfish over three generation lengths, based on the species declines at Penghu Island, Taiwan skate landings data, and reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skate range from 40–96%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Brown Guitarfish, with no areas of refuge from fishing pressure. Severe reductions of guitarfishes have occurred elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific due to fishing pressure and while the datasets presented are outside the range of the Brown Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The species is rare in Japan, has virtually disappeared from the Republic of Korea over the past 20–25 years, and has declined by 75–96% in part of Taiwan where mainly gravid females are landed.<em> </em>It is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Brown Guitarfish is endemic to the Northwest Pacific where it occurs from Japan to Taiwan, including Republic of Korea and China (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).","<p>This species is used for the meat, fins, cartilage, and skin. In Japan, the meat is valuable and used for sashimi in Kyushu, Shikoku, and Seto Inland Sea regions (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The meat is also desired and valuable in South Korea (C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). Based on the congener, the Ringed Guitarfish (<em>R. hynnicephalus</em>), individuals too small for human consumption are used for fish meal in Taiwan, and likely China. The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including <em>Rhinobatos </em>spp.)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Moore&#160;2017). However, the fins of the smaller Brown Guitarfish are of lower value due to their small size and are consumed domestically in China, rather than traded internationally (J. Zhang pers. comm. 27/08/2019). In Taiwan, the fins of the larger individual Brown Guitarfish are removed for consumption, but similar to China, it may be for domestic consumption, as fins of this species or other small <em>Rhinobatos</em> spp. have not been recorded in trade surveys in Hong Kong or Singapore (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 31/01/2020). The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 29/09/2018).</p>",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation or management measures in place for this species. In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East China Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). This species may receive some protection in protected areas across China that have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>    <p>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). The species may have refuge in the ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and  ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas  accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively  (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>    <p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It is likely demersal on the insular shelves and its depth is unknown, but like other guitarfishes, is presumably less than 100 m. The species is a retained bycatch of a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, and gillnets and the meat is consumed locally and fins of larger individuals possibly traded. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Severe population reduction is suspected from actual levels of exploitation, as well as declines in ray landings. Landings data from 1976 to 2006, of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries decreased by 76% over 16 years from 1991 to 2006 consistent with population reductions of 99% over the past three generation lengths (24 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. This species is found in a relatively small area that is easily accessible to fishers. It is suspected that the Philippine Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to high levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Philippine Guitarfish is presumably demersal on the insular shelves and its depth is unknown, but like other guitarfishes, it is presumably less than 100 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It reaches a size of at least 84 cm total length (TL) with males maturing at 56 cm TL and females maturing at a slightly larger size (Last et al. 2014). Reproduction is presumably lecithotrophic viviparous, but relatively little is known of the biology of the species. There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age and, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Common Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos rhinobatos</em>). The Common Guitarfish has an age-at-maturity of four years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14 years (Başusta <em>et al</em>. 2008).

The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~3 gross tonnes (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per person in 2013 (Helgil 2020).","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are landings data for combined ray species, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.

These declines in landings of rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014).

It likely occurs in shallow coastal and continental shelf waters, but depth range is unknown. Maximum size is also unknown as the largest recorded individual was an immature male of 99 cm total length. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Taiwanese Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light.&#160;Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Taiwanese Wedgefish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 10 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade.

There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of wedgefishes, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Taiwanese Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while these datasets are outside the range of the Taiwanese Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). Furthermore, Taiwan is a major fishing nation with a long history of the exploitation of coastal resources, which were considered to be overfished by the 1950s. It is inferred that the Taiwanese Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.&#160;The apparent restricted distribution of the species increases its extinction risk.","The Taiwanese Wedgefish likely occurs in shallow coastal and continental shelf waters, but depth range is unknown (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

Life history is unknown but wedgefishes are lecithotrophic viviparous with small litter sizes. Generation length is estimated as 10 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). In general, the demand for shark and ray product has increased in recent decades due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018) and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use in Taiwan, and the very limited distribution of this species raises serious concerns for its ability to sustain historic and current levels of fishing pressure. Taiwan is a major fishing nation with a long history of the exploitation of coastal resources, which were considered to be overfished by the 1950s (and which led to the development of Taiwan's distant water fleet) (Kuo and Booth 2011). Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally (Lack and Sant 2011) and is a major global shark fin trading nation (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2006, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore, there is a an extensive illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing issue in Taiwan (Kuo and Booth 2011).<br/><br/>There is little information on the habitat use of Taiwanese Wedgefish, but it is likely to inhabit shallow, inshore soft-bottom environments which are potentially threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation, which is a significant issue in the Indo-West Pacific (e.g., Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, there are several relevant historical accounts and more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. These historical accounts and contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Taiwanese Wedgefish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, M.

While the above datasets are outside the range of the Taiwanese Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia).

Generation length is suspected to be ~6 years, based on information available for the larger (to 180 cm TL) Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 5 years, a maximum age of 24 years, and thus a generation length of 14.5 years (Martin and Cailliet 1988).","The Shortnose Eagle Ray is captured in artisanal gillnet and beach seine fisheries, which are intense across much of its range. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, beach seine and drifting gillnet fisheries are intense and capture this species in relatively high numbers (Araújo <em>et al.</em> 2018). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997 the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015).

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Blackchin Guitarfish has an annual fecundity of 5-24 and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including the Blackchin Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger giant guitarfish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Blackchin Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades. Furthermore, the Blackchin Guitarfish was historically common throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea but has now disappeared from former areas of its range. It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Blackchin Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m on the continental shelf (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). It occurs on sandy and muddy substrates. Maximum size is 265 cm total length (TL); size at maturity varies between the Eastern Atlantic (Senegal; males mature at 155 cm TL; females mature at 163 cm TL; Seck <em>et al.</em> 2004), and the Mediterranean (Tunisia; males mature at 100-112 cm TL; females mature at 110–138 cm TL;&#160;Capapé and Zaouali 1994, Enajjar<em> et al.</em> 2012).&#160;Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 5-12 (Tunisia) and 16–24 (Senegal) pups with an annual reproductive cycle; size at birth is ~34 cm TL (Capapé and Zaouali 1994,&#160;Seck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b). Age at maturity is 2.9 years in males and 5.1 years in females; maximum age is 14 years (198 cm TL female) (Enajjar<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012) but is likely higher given the species reaches a larger maximum size. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure in West Africa with a long history of artisanal and industrial fishing. As a result, demersal coastal fisheries resources are considered overexploited in significant areas of the region (e.g., FAO 2018b). <br/><br/>In the Mediterranean, the Blackchin Guitarfish is regularly landed in fisheries both as a target species and as bycatch, particularly in the southern and eastern Mediterranean (see Lteif 2015, Newell 2016).<br/><br/>Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Diop and Dossa 2011); the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006), and no doubt occurs more widely. Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and significant declines of Blackchin Guitarfish (Tous<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1998, Diop and Dossa 2011). <br/><br/>Several countries across the West African range of the Blackchin Guitarfish are significant fishing nations with high levels of fishing pressure on the marine environment (including Mauritania, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana). Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century: in 1950 there were 125 pirogues (small fishing boats), in the 1980s there were &lt;750, in the late 1990s there were &gt;2,500, and in 2005 there was nearly 4,000 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Furthermore, the industrial fleet is significant with 172 vessels (mostly trawlers) licensed to fish in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2015 (ONS 2017). Similarly, the number of artisanal pirogues in Senegal rose from ~5,000 in 1982 to &gt;9,000 in 2003 and 12,699 in 2006, although it has since fallen slightly to 11,889 in 2013 (FAO 2008, ANSD 2016). The industrial fleet operating in Senegalese waters included 91 trawlers in 2013 (ANSD 2016). <br/><br/>Within parts of West Africa, the Blackchin Guitarfish was a dominant component of the batoid landings in artisanal fisheries including in Sierra Leone (e.g. Seisay 2005), and in Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau where it was a target species (Diop and Dossa 2011). This included heavy targeting of the species within the Banc d'Arguin National Park, Mauritania prior to the implementation of a ban on directly targeted elasmobranch fishing from December 2003 (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, artisanal and illegal fishing effort is significant and ongoing in the park (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction primarily due to a lack of species-specific reporting.The Blackchin Guitarfish was regarded as historically common within both the northern (Doderlein 1884, de Buen 1935) and southern (Quignard and Capapé 1971, Whitehead&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1984,&#160;Bradaï&#160;<em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006) Mediterranean Sea. However, there are now contrasting situations between these two areas. The Blackchin Guitarfish has largely disappeared from the northern Mediterranean and it was not recorded in extensive trawl surveys under the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) program from 1994 to 2015 (Relini and Piccinetti 1991, Newell 2016) or in trawl surveys in the Adriatic Sea between 1948 and 2005 (Ferretti<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><em>&#160;</em>2013). In the southern Mediterranean (including the Gulf of Gabés, and areas of the eastern Mediterranean which seem to be a core parts of the species' distribution), the species is still present and in some areas still commonly caught (e.g., Echwikhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Soldo&#160;<em>et al</em><em>. </em>2014,&#160;Lteif 2015, Newell 2016).&#160;</p><p>In the Banc D'Arguin National Park in Mauritania, 95% of Blackchin Guitarfish caught are smaller than their size-at-maturity and an analysis of the change in the average size of landed individuals from 1998 to 2007 highlights a significant size decrease (Diop and Dossa 2011). No species-specific trend data are available, but this size reduction, and the high levels of exploitation across West Africa suggest a population reduction, which can also be inferred from looking at data available from outside the Atlantic Ocean on population reduction in wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes.<br/><br/>In the Indo-West Pacific (outside of the range of the Blackchin Guitarfish), there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates (non species-specific) which can be used to infer population reduction, and these can be considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly where they are under heavy exploitation (see the Supplementary Information). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)&#160;(recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018a, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high and increasing across the West African range of the Blackchin Guitarfish and there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation in the Mediterranean part of its range which is ongoing (see the Threats section). There is nothing to suspect that similar declines as outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific have not occurred in West Africa. This species is not likely to have any serious refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins.<br/><br/>It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Blackchin Guitarfish is widely distributed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the northern coast of Portugal to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea (where it appears to be more prevalent in the southern and eastern regions) (Capapé 1989, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).","<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.

In particular, it is listed on Annex II of the Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity Protocol for the Mediterranean under the Barcelona Convention, and it cannot be retained on board, trans-shipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold, displayed or offered for sale, and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible, pursuant to Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1. European Union (EU) vessels are prohibited from fishing for guitarfishes in EU waters of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) sub-areas I (Barents Sea), II (Norwegian Sea, Spitsbergen and Bear Island), III (Skagerrak, Kattegat, Sound, Belt Sea, and Baltic Sea), IV (North Sea), V (Iceland and Faroe Islands), VI (Rockall, northwest coast of Scotland and North Ireland), VII (Irish Sea, West of Ireland, Porcupine Bank, English Channel, Bristol Channel, Celtic Sea, and Southwest of Ireland), VIII (Bay of Biscay), IX (Portuguese waters), X (Azores grounds) and XII (north of the Azores), but not in the Mediterranean Sea. Note that the Blackchin Guitarfish does not occur in many of these areas. In 2013, the European Union (EU) banned the removal of shark fins on board vessels (CEC 2013) in order to enhance enforcement of the 2003 EU ban on shark finning (CEC 2003) and facilitate improved shark fishery data collection.

It inhabits estuaries and shallow coastal areas around the Amazon River outflow at depths of 5–40 m. The meat is highly valued and this species has been targeted since in the early 2000s to supply demand from North American and European markets; targeted fishing continues as the market has shifted to Asia.&#160;It is targeted and/or captured as utilized bycatch in intense and largely unmanaged artisanal and commercial gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries throughout its geographic range. This combination of intense  and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in this area has led to  the disappearance of several other large elasmobranch species in the  region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>). <span>Due to the intensity of the often unmanaged fishing pressure from  multiple gears that this species is exposed to, combined with the volume  of catch, international demand, and its low productivity, it is suspected that the Colares Stingray  has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past  three generations (69 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d. <span></span>","The Colares Stingray inhabits estuaries and shallow coastal areas around the Amazon River outflow at depths of 5–40 m (usually 5–20 m) (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b, P. Charvet unpubl. data 2018). These stingrays live in estuaries during the dry season but move further offshore during the rainy season when discharge is high (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). It reaches a maximum body size of at least 165 cm disc width (DW); females are mature at 91 cm DW and males at 63 cm DW (Santos <em>et al. </em>2004, 2007). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 1–4 pups per litter (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Generation length (GL) is suspected to be about 23 years, based on data for the Diamond Stingray (<em>Hypanus dipterurus</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 9.5 years and a maximum age of 28 years and thus a GL of 18.8 years (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2008). The Diamond Stingray is smaller at only 100 cm DW, and generation length is therefore scaled up to estimate 23 years for the Colares Stingray.","The Colares Stingray is targeted and/or captured as utilized bycatch in commercial and artisanal gillnets, longlines, and trawls. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2001). Despite some spatial closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015). This species began to be targeted there in the early 2000s and at the time the meat was destined for North American and European markets; targeted fishing continues and the market has shifted to Asia (Moro <em>et al.</em> 2018). Catches have been observed during preliminary work there that are made up of over 90% this species by weight (Moro <em>et al.</em> 2018). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fishing pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). Paired trawling, where multiple vessels are linked up to expand the trawl footprint, began in the 1970s in this area; this practice has expanded and now up to 5–6 trawl vessels are linked together, resulting in a trawl footprint several kilometers wide (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2018). Furthermore, these vessels deploy multiple longlines as well, further increasing fishing pressure.

Generation length (GL) is suspected to be about 28 years, based on data for the Diamond Stingray (<em>Hypanus dipterurus</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 9.5 years and a maximum age of 28 years and thus a GL of 18.8 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2007, 2008). The Diamond Stingray is smaller at only 100 cm DW, and generation length is therefore scaled up to estimate 28 years for the Wingfin Stingray.","The Wingfin Stingray is captured as utilized bycatch in commercial and artisanal gillnets, longlines, and trawls, which are intense across much of its range. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense and are&#160;unmanaged. Generally, catches have peaked and subsequently declined, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal fish species was introduced there in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and a ban on industrial trawling went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Nevertheless, industrial fleets continue to fish with longlines and handline in Venezuela and also venture further afield to the Guianas and northern Brazil (Mendoza 2015). In Trinidad and Tobago, there were over 130 trawl vessels of various sizes operating off the west and south coasts of Trinidad, and over 1,000 artisanal vessels operating throughout the country in 2011 (Mohammed <em>et al. </em>2011). In Guyana, there were ~600 artisanal vessels by 1998 (Shing 1999), and similar levels of effort are suspected in Suriname and French Guiana. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2001). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and  44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the  2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by ten-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010 - mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch (Walker&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2018).&#160;Reports indicate that along the Benue River in Nigeria, fishing effort more than doubled in the period 1986–1991 from 839 fishers in 1986 to 1,811 fishers in 1991 (Knaap 1994). This was in parallel to a reported increase in the number of longlines and traps used from 1,465 in 1986 to 10,820 in 1989 (Knaap 1994). The increasing demand for fish is driven by human population growth and movement to coastal areas which has increased settlements by local communities along river banks (Alum-Udensi&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016). For example, the population of Lokoja town in Nigeria doubled within two decades (Alum-Udensi&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016).</span></p><p>Fishers in Cameroon have attributed declines of freshwater rays species to frequent local droughts.&#160;Indeed, local droughts have been notable in the region with rates of water flows having their lowest recorded since the beginning of the century by 1980–1990 leading to drastic reductions in floodplain surfaces and the draining of some sections of the Niger River and impacting fish species&#160;(Lae&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats as well as the freshwater habitat in which the Thorny Whipray has been recorded are threatened by habitat loss and degradation (</span>Knaap 1994, Abowei and Hart 2008,&#160;<span style="""">Stobutzki&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unregulated tourism development; pollution including unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, and hydrocarbon and heavy metals; sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007,&#160;</span>Alum-Udensi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;<span style="""">Polidoro&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span>Over the last 30 years, almost all the main rivers in the region have been dammed at least in one location and have gradually become artificially engineered with the building of embankments, free-flow canals, and irrigation ditches (GCLME 2006, Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). The fragmentation of these freshwater systems has led to drastic changes in river flows and abrupt modifications in the hydrological conditions along deltas and estuaries including the elimination of regular flooding in the wet season which has led to the loss of lagoons as well as sediment in catchment areas due to the entrapment of silt behind dams (Dumas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). These changes and habitat loss due to dam development have likely affected the distribution and abundance of this species and there are concerns about the number of additional proposed dams in several West African countries (e.g., 38 potential dam sites identified in Gabon) (Cutler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Thorny Whipray that can be used to calculate population reduction.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The most recent estimates indicate that the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW (tons per kilowatts) in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch landings were&#160;3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an&#160;increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;<a style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a>. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years 2010–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<p><span style="""">Second, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that in recent decades there have been limited records of this species from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. However, it is important to note that this could be due to&#160;taxonomic uncertainty and&#160;confusion with other species of dasyatids&#160;that occur in the region. Previously this species was believed to only occur in freshwater systems, but it has now also been confirmed from coastal areas. However, it was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across&#160;the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region (Mauritania to&#160;Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) between 2004–2011 while other species of large rays were recorded (Diop&#160;and Dossa 2011).

However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear. Furthermore, the ease of access to this species' entire distribution as well as the increasingly fragmented and degraded habitat it occupies in freshwater systems is of concern. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, anecdotal accounts of local extinction of other freshwater rays in some areas, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Thorny Whipray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (90 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Thorny Whipray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic from Guinea-Bissau to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Thorson and Watson 1975, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to an unknown depth, however, it occurs predominantly in shallow inshore waters and is closely associated with mangroves. The species is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl and gillnet, and retained for local consumption of the meat. Across the species’ restricted range, there is a long history of overfishing inshore marine resources and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of rays from both Indonesia and Thailand infer population reductions of &gt; 80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). The species has no refuge from fishing pressure and is also threatened by inshore habitat degradation. It is suspected that the Starrynose Cowtail Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","The Starrynose Cowtail Ray is demersal inshore on soft substrates (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Its depth range is unknown, but it is known to occur predominantly in shallow inshore waters, and it is closely associated with mangroves (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of at least 43 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~41 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Nothing else is known of its biology. As there is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, generation length was inferred as 12 years based on data for the similar-sized Coral Sea Maskray (<em>Neotrygon trigonoides</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).<br/><p><br/></p>","The species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl and gillnet. In Indonesia, the Starry Cowtail Ray is uncommonly caught by mini-trawls and only a single individual was recorded from market surveys in 2019 (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally and the country has been among the top shark fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). The catch of rays is rising as shark fisheries collapse; in 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (&gt;95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Additionally, this species is subject to intensive trawl and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.<br/><br/>In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg/hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg/hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are two lines of evidence throughout its range in Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, a catch reconstruction for central Indonesia and a research survey. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch then decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort has been increasing during this period and this represents a 92% population reduction when scaled to three generation lengths (36 years) of the Starrynose Cowtail Ray. Secondly, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 reveal more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Considering these catch and effort trends, the suspected population reduction of Starrynose Cowtail Rays in Indonesia is &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).<br/><br/>There are no species-specific ray landings data in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from the Exclusive Economic Zone from 1998 to 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and the dramatic declines in whiprays and rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Starrynose Cowtail Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Starrynose Cowtail Ray has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (36 years).",Decreasing,"The Starrynose Cowtail Ray has a restricted distribution in the Western Central Pacific off southwest Kalimantan, Indonesia and possibly in the Gulf of Thailand; it may have a wider distribution within the Indo-Malay archipelago (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019).",The species is likely used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).,Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 marine protected areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). However, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnage are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It occurs on the continental shelf, mainly at depths of 10-40 m, although the type specimen was reportedly collected from 366 m which would be unusual for a rhinobatid. There is also some information that indicates it prefers coral reefs. It is a small guitarfish, reaching 75 cm total length, with a small litter size (mostly 1-4, occasionally up to six). The entire range of this species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure with large numbers of trawlers operating around southern India (as well as other fishing gear). Significant declines (86%) in the landings of wedgefishes and guitarfishes combined have been documented from only a short period of time (over the five years since 2002) at a landing site in Tamil Nadu. This is the equivalent of &gt;97% decline for the Stripenose Guitarfish over the the last three generation periods (15 years). This is likely to be fully representative of the species' entire range. Ongoing intense fishing pressure, as well as declines in the quality of coral reefs raise serious concerns for this species, and a future population decline is suspected over the next three generations (2017-2032). The species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd+3cd.","The Stripenose Guitarfish is a small species reported from the continental shelf to 366 m (Weigmann 2016), but they typically prefer shallow waters of 10-40 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016), including coral habitats (Bineesh<em>&#160;</em>K.K.&#160;unpub. data). Although the holotype was reportedly captured at a depth of 366 m (Nair and Lal Mohan 1973), Last <em>et al. </em>(2016) suggest that is erroneous (rhinobatids are generally inshore to mid-continental shelf species, rather than occurring on the slope). Reproduction is presumably lecithotrophic viviparous, but relatively little is known of the biology of the species. Pregnant females occur from 58 cm total length (TL). Maximum size is 65 cm TL for males and 75 cm TL for females. Litter size mostly 1-4, but occasionally up to six. Generation length is inferred to be 5 years from the Lesser Guitarfish (<em>Acroteriobatus annulatus</em>)&#160;from southern Africa (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989).","This species is taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries operating off southwestern India, and probably Sri Lanka. Fishing pressure is generally very intense with a large number of vessels in operation, and is increasing (see the <em>Population</em> section).<br/><br/>Its preferred coral habitat is declining globally due to destructive fishing practices, coastal development, and the effects of climate change such as rising sea surface temperatures and more extreme maximum sea surface temperatures (Carpenter<em> et al.</em> 2008, Normile 2016).","This species is regularly caught in shrimp trawl fisheries in southern India, mostly in 30-40 m where it is often caught with the Bengal Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos annandalei</em>) (Bineesh K.K. unpub. data). While there are no species-specific data available on this species, elasmobranchs have been heavily exploited in Tamil Nadu and Kerala (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002). Significant declines in wedgefish and guitarfish (including rhinobatids) landings have been documented in Tamil Nadu through monitoring at Chennai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009). Even though this is northeast of the range of the Stripenose Guitarfish, trawlers in Tamil Nadu fish widely throughout southern India (Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014) and data can be considered representative of the broader area. Wedgefish and guitarfish landings decreased by 86% over the five years of monitoring (2002-2006). The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI 2010) reports that 5,767 trawlers operate in Tamil Nadu waters, and so fishing pressure is intense with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014). Trawling is also intense in Kerala where CMFRI (2010) reported 3,678 trawlers.<br/><br/>Data available from Maharashtra, although outside the area of occurrence of this species, further demonstrate the declines in inshore batoid landings in an area where there are also high trawler numbers (5,613 trawlers in that state; CMFRI 2010). There, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This would equate to an ~60% decline over a period of three generation spans of the Stripenose Guitarfish (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Stripenose Guitarfish is endemic to the Arabian Seas region where it is known from southern India and Sri Lanka (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Bineesh K.K. unpub. data).",The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets and also enters the international trade in dried form.

Juveniles are found in estuaries and much of the fishing effort, particularly with stake nets, occurs in this habitat. Adults are captured trawl fisheries. The limited distribution overlaps with intense coastal fisheries throughout the entire geographic range of the species and the shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge.

Despite a ban in 1980, benthic trawl fisheries still exist in Indonesia; small vessels (&lt;10&#160;Gross Tonnes) have modified their gear into ""mini trawls"" or&#160;<em>cakalang&#160;</em>which target and retain demersal species (H. Booth pers. comm. 30/11/2019). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). For example, steep declines of wedgefishes (Rhinidae) have been documented&#160;as a result of target fisheries using large-mesh gillnets and tangle nets (D'Aberto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). This fishery began in the 1970s and peaked at approximately 500 vessels in 1987 at Aru Island before declining to 100 vessels by 1996 (D'Aberto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). <br/><br/>This species was reported to be caught incidentally on demersal longline fisheries operating on the continental shelf and upper slope (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). Off Java, there are approximately 1,000 vessels operating demersal longlines at depths of 100–200 m; these fisheries target a number of species, including dogfish (Squalidae) and gulper sharks (Centrophoridae) (Dharmadi, unpubl. data 2019). From&#160;Cilacap-Central Java Fishing&#160;port, the Indonesian Angel Shark has been recorded and retained from demersal gillnet fisheries targeting catfish (<em>Arius</em>&#160;spp)&#160;(Dharmadi, unpubl. data 2019).","Angel sharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines (see the Angelshark (<em>S. squatina</em>, Morey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). This species is now only rarely landed. According to daily landings data from Tanjung Luar-West Nusa Tenggara, Lombok (2014–2016), the species was only landed one to three times each year (Fahmi unpubl. data 2018).&#160;Landings data of angel sharks (known locally as ""Isabela"") from Cilacap-Central Java&#160;Ocean Fishing Port, Java showed a decline from 11,569 kg reported in 2008 to 199 kg in 2018 (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019).&#160;This represents a decline of &gt;99% when scaled to three generation lengths (47 years) of the Indonesian Angel Shark. This level of decline is not species-specific but is highly informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in angel sharks in the region.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is intensive across the entire range of the Indonesian Angel Shark.&#160;The species is suspected to have undergone a large population reduction with ongoing declines across its range. The&#160;Indonesian Angel Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (47 years), based on abundance data of angel sharks in its area of distribution and levels of exploitation, and therefore the species is assessed as Critically Endangered <a style="""">A2bd.</a>",Decreasing,"The Indonesian Angel Shark&#160;is endemic to Indonesia (from West Java to Flores Island) in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, where it has been collected from four fish landings sites (Last and White 2008, Fahmi unpubl. data 2018).","The Indonesian Angel Shark is sometimes utilised locally for its meat, fins, and fishmeal (White&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), although the species has low economic value in the local market and is often discarded by fishermen due to its perceived strange appearance (Fahmi unpubl. data 2018).",Marine,"There are no species-specific measures in place for the Indonesian Angel Shark.&#160;Further information is required on its distribution, ecology and life history, as well species’ interactions with fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

This species is known only from three type specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, the last of which was collected in 1934.&#160;<a>The maximum size is unknown but, based on similar species, it likely reached a size of ~100 cm total length</a>.&#160;Like other small requiem sharks it was probably found in shallow inshore coastal waters less than 50 m deep, and hence is unlikely to have any depth refuge from fisheries. There are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct and three lines of evidence against. First, this species is known only from three type specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, the last of which was collected in 1934. Second, it is likely to have been fished throughout both its known and plausible range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s and is likely to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% in the past three generation lengths&#160;(27 years)&#160;(and also the past three generations prior). Third, there is considerable passive surveillance and there have been five directed taxonomic surveys likely to record and identify this species. Yet, there have been no reasonably convincing, recent local reports or unconfirmed sightings since this species was first flagged as an undescribed species in the late 1970s. The three lines of evidence against extinction are that first, it does not have any ecological specialisation that might predispose to extinction. Second, it is a small requiem shark and might be easily confused with or gone unnoticed among large catches or collections of other carcharhinids. Third, the recent rediscovery of two other ‘lost’ carcharhinid species caution that further specimens of the Lost shark might be found in the future. Taken together, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) and the remaining population size is suspected to be fewer than 50 individuals&#160;and is inferred to be continuing to decline&#160;due to actual or potential fishing levels. The weighted probability of extinction of both the threats and records and surveys models combined is 0.77–0.78 and hence the Lost Shark species is suspected to be Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)&#160;A2d; D.</p>","<p>The habitat and depth range of the Lost Shark is unknown as it has only been collected from fish markets. Habitat can be inferred from other members of the <em>Carcharhinus porosus </em>subgroup which are generally found in coastal shelf waters, for example the Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>) inhabits muddy inshore areas and estuaries down to a depth of 84 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann <em>et al. </em>2016). The Lost Shark is only known from a late-term embryo (34 cm total length; TL) and two juveniles (37 and 43 cm TL) (White <em>et al. </em>2019a). Maximum size was probably small around 100 cm TL (Compagno and Niem 1998). Its life history is unknown, but the Lost Shark can be inferred as having a low productivity, from its close relative the Smalltail Shark which has a litter size of 2–9 pups, a gestation length of ~1 year and a biennial reproductive cycle (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 1999, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Smalltail Shark has a low maximum population growth rate for its small body size due to its low fecundity and biennial reproductive rate with an <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.183 ± 0.13–0.24 (95% confidence interval), which is similar to Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus,</em> <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.188) and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna,</em> <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.18) (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length can be inferred from the Smalltail Shark which matures at 6 years of age and has a maximum age of 12 years, and thus it is estimated to have a generation length of 9 years (Lessa and Santana 1998, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p>","<p>Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive.&#160;Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets. <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments, and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2, 251 vessels in 1950 to 7, 650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 29/04/2020).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region&#160;</a>(Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010).<a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">&#160;In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (</a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">Heileman 2009, </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"" style="""">Heileman and Tang 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995).</a></p>","<p>Intensive fisheries began more than a century ago in the South China Sea region (Butcher 1996) and it is one of the most heavily fished and poorly monitored regions in the world (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2016, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2020). Consequently, most target fisheries of productive medium-sized teleost fishes were overfished by the 1960s and populations of larger sharks and rays collapsed and disappeared long before systematic catch documentation. For example, industrial trawl fisheries were introduced to the Gulf of Thailand in the 1960s and thereafter a rapid build-up of effort occurred due to initially large catches followed by the 1973 fuel crisis which forced vessels to return to their local waters in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). This led to a rapid decline in catch per unit effort from 300 kg per hour of trawling in 1961 to 50 kg per hour in the 1980s and 20–30 kg per hour by the 1990s. By 1970, large finfish, sharks and skates had been fished down resulting in a 60% decline with the first five years of industrialised trawl fishing in the Gulf of Thailand (Myers and Worm 2003, Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. These declines are equivalent to a population reduction of 83.3% between 1960–1980 and an overall 91.7% decline over 1960–1990 for a three-generation length of 27 years. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landings data&#160;for 1998–2018&#160;are available for all combined shark species from the Gulf of Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). These showed an 86% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 9,005 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to 1,250 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003–2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort, but it suggests that the population reduction from 1960–1990 of the overall 91.7% decline is likely to have continued and be much greater than this estimate. In Viet Nam, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 were reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on landings data (Pauly<em><span lang=""EN-GB""> et al.</em> 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em><span lang=""EN-GB"">et al.</span></em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em><span lang=""EN-GB"">et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), reconstructed carcharhinid landings showed a 66% decline from a peak of 7,400 t in 1997 to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s, then sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t then decreased to 4,000–5,000 t throughout the 1980s, before increasing to the peak 1997 catch and then steeply declining in the mid-2000s. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus these declines can be used infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Sarawak.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Lost Shark (27 years) they represent declines of &gt;91.7%, 96% and 82% in Thailand, Viet Nam, and Sarawak, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Hence, overall, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations due to actual or potential fishing levels and meets the criteria for Critically Endangered A2d.<br/><br/>The probability of extinction can be estimated based on a Threats Model and a Records and Surveys Model (Akçakaya <em>et al. </em>2017). There are three known specimens of the Lost Shark: the holotype was a 43 cm female from Bangkok, Thailand, with no information on collection date or collector and the two paratypes were&#160;from&#160;Baram, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, collected in 1897 and from&#160;Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, collected in&#160;1934 (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a). The last known record of the Lost Shark was of the specimen collected in 1934 (White <em>et al. </em>2019a). There is extensive potential for passive surveying resulting from the daily sampling of fish assemblages through routine fishing activities, with thousands to millions of individuals processed at landing sites throughout the region on a daily basis. We conservatively estimate that the fraction of habitat passively surveyed each year is 0.15 (minimum 0.1 to maximum 0.3; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information)). <br/><br/>This species is a newly described requiem shark, which are notoriously difficult to identify except by experienced observers. Further, this species was only taxonomically described in 2019 and hence will not have appeared in historic species lists and been sought after by scientists. Hence, we assume a very low probability that this species would be recorded (<em>P(r)</em> best estimate = 0.005, minimum 0, maximum 0.01; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information). But if noted as being different enough to be recorded we assume that a scientist would be inclined to seek expert help with identification and the probability that the taxon might be identified as extant is higher (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 0.1, minimum 0, maximum 0.2; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>Given that this is a newly described species, we have only considered dedicated surveys by professional taxonomists that would have the experience to record the presence of a previously undocumented species but were also likely aware of the existence of the undescribed&#160;<em>Carcharhinus</em> sp. first listed in the 1970s&#160;(Compagno 1979, 1988) and subsequently known as&#160;<em>Carcharhinus&#160;</em>sp. A (Voigt&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2011, Compagno <em>et al. </em>2005a). This suggests a low to moderate likelihood of it being recorded and identified correctly (<em>P(r)</em>&#160;best estimate = 0.4, minimum 0.3, maximum 0.5; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information) consistent with a species that is moderately inconspicuous or rare and that was searched for with reasonable effort and appropriate techniques (IUCN Guidelines 2019).&#160;This suggests a high likelihood of it being correctly identified (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 1, minimum 1, maximum 1; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information). Similarly, extensive surveys of sharks and rays across Borneo, including in Baram, Sarawak where the Lost Shark was historically collected, failed to locate any additional records (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Extensive surveys and monitoring in areas adjacent to the historic range of the Lost Shark, including eastern Indonesia recorded &gt;21,000 sharks recorded over six years of surveys (White 2007).&#160;We assigned lower probability of recording this species outside of the known countries of occurrence, but within the South China Sea, e.g. for the Philippines survey which did not record this species&#160;(e.g. Compagno&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005b).<br/><br/>We also considered fish landing site surveys across Southeast Asia over recent decades, including in Viet Nam, Thailand, and Malaysian Borneo, that have not recorded the Lost Shark. For example, in Viet Nam,&#160;market sampling and research surveys using a combination of fishing gear (bottom trawl, gillnet, hook and line, and longline) carried out by the Research Institute for Marine Fisheries (RIMF) from 2001–2004 in the Tonkin Gulf, Southeast, and Southwest areas recorded nearly 120,000 kg of shark catch but did not record this species (SEAFDEC 2006). For this survey we assumed a significant fraction of former range was surveyed (eps best estimate = 0.3, minimum 0.2, maximum 0.4; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information), a slightly lower level of experience to record the presence of a previously undocumented species (<em>P(r)</em> best estimate = 0.3, minimum 0.2, maximum 0.4; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information) and correctly identify it (<em>P(i)</em> best estimate = 0.6, minimum 0.5, maximum 0.7; Table 3 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Misidentification and misreporting through confusion with other carcharhinid sharks may have been an issue detecting this species, although there is now reasonable capacity and knowledge in the region to correctly identify sharks. The increasing use of genetic barcoding techniques, including for dried fins or other body parts, has also increased the detection of rare species. Despite this, no samples that would be attributable to this species have been detected using such barcoding techniques.<br/><br/>The Threats Model (Keith <em>et al.</em> 2017) was used to estimate a probability of extinction based on the wider understanding of the actual and potential levels of fishing resulting in inferred population reductions of &gt;91.7%, 96% and 82% in Thailand, Viet Nam and Sarawak, respectively. Intense fisheries have been developing for over a century, but industrial fisheries developed in the 1960s and have been operating for more than 6.6 generation lengths (60 years). These intense fisheries occur beyond the known range states and indeed extend throughout the broader possible range of this species throughout the South China Sea. Hence, as a result of the long duration and severity of threats in its likely range the chance of local extinction is very high <em>P(local)</em> = 0.9 (minimum 0.8 to maximum 1) and the probability that threats occurred throughout its range is certain <em>P(spatial)</em> = 1 (minimum 1 to maximum 1). As a consequence, the probability of extinction estimated from the threats model is 0.9 (minimum 0.8 to maximum 1) (See Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The records and survey model (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2017) was used to estimate the probability of extinction as 0.47 minimum 0.36 to maximum 0.91) (See Supplementary Information). The combined probability of extinction is 0.629, however, greater weight is given to the Threats Model, which has narrower confidence intervals, and the weighted probability of extinction is between 0.77–0.78 depending on the type of weighting (0.78 from 1/range weighting and 0.77 from the 1-range weighting; see Supplementary Information). This weighted probability of extinction (0.77–0.78) is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to&#160;0.9&#160;and hence falls within the threshold of&#160;CR(PE) (Akçakaya <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>There are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct.&#160;First, this species in known from only three specimens and, hence, the declines were not documented.&#160;Second, severe threatening processes have occurred throughout range for a long period of time. Specifically, the Lost Shark is likely to have been fished throughout its range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s more than six generations ago and is likely to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;90% in the past three generation lengths (and indeed the past three generation lengths prior).&#160;Third, there is considerable passive surveillance and there have been directed surveys that have been likely to record and identify this species. Yet, there have been no reasonably convincing or recent local reports or unconfirmed sightings since this species was first flagged as a potentially undescribed species by Leonard Compagno in the late 1970s (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a).<br/><br/>There are three lines of evidence against this species being extinct.&#160;First, this species does not have any ecological specialisation that might predispose to extinction.&#160;Second, this species is a small requiem shark and might be easily confused with or gone unnoticed among large catches or collections of other carcharhind species (White <em>et al.</em> 2019a). There are 17 species in this genus alone in Indonesia (White 2007) and the juveniles of many of the coastal requiem shark species could be easily mistaken for or mask the presence of this species in fisheries catches at landings sites.&#160;Third, the rediscovery of two ‘lost’ carcharhinid species caution that further specimens of this species might be identified in the future. The Borneo Shark (<em>Carcharhinus borneensis</em>) had not been recorded since 1937 but was rediscovered in 2004 in Sarawak Borneo (where one of the last specimens of the Lost Shark was collected) (White <em>et al.</em> 2010). Similarly, the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leiodon</em>) was previously described in 1985 from the holotype collected from Yemen in 1902, but then 25 specimens were discovered in a fish market in Kuwait in 2008 more than 3,000 km away from the last known record (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2011), with further specimens found in fish markets in Kuwait, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in UAE, and Yemen (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Taken together there are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct and three lines of evidence against. The decline of this species has not been well-documented and the last specimen was collected in 1934, however, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to actual or potential fishing levels and the number of mature individuals is suspected to be less than 50. The weighted probability of extinction of both the threats and records and surveys models combined (0.77–0.78) is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to&#160;0.9 and hence falls within the threshold for CR(PE) and the species is suspected to be Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) A2d; D.</p>",Unknown,"The Lost Shark was known from the southern South China Sea (Gulf of Thailand, Viet Nam, and Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo) in the Western Central Pacific Ocean (Compagno and Niem 1998, White <em>et al. </em>2019a).","Sharks are heavily exploited and utilized in&#160;Southeast&#160;Asia for their meat, fins,&#160;and other products (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009, Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2015).

It has a wide historic range from Oman to southern China, but known records are scattered, and it has only been reliably verified from a handful of countries. It appears to occur in shallow coastal waters, and has also been reported to enter rivers, although this has not been verified.<br/><br/>The contemporary range of this species is poorly defined and museum specimens were collected pre-1960. There are reports from 1979, the 1990s, and 2000, but none of these could be verified. Its identification is problematic, and it is easily confused with a number of other <em>Carcharhinus</em> species (for example, recent putative records from Sri Lanka).<br/><br/>The Framework for using the Threats Model and the Records and Survey Model was applied to the Pondicherry Shark. The probability that the combination of threats (generally unregulated fisheries across its historic range) affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction, and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species, were both very high. As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00). Its range has been subject to considerable survey effort directed at sharks and rays in general, and some dedicated searches for this species, all of which have failed to produce a verified record. Given the wide distribution of the species, these surveys have generally covered a small proportion of the species’ range. Furthermore, given the identification issues, the probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the surveys is low. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.12 (minimum = 0; maximum = 0.31). The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.44–0.45, which is &lt;0.5 and therefore outside the threshold for Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct).<br/><br/>Given a lack of verifiable records since 1960, it is considered that the major population reduction would have occurred prior to the last three generation period (estimated at 27 years from a congener), therefore an assessment under criterion A is not appropriate.&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk52520711"">However,&#160;given the lack of records, the number of mature individuals is assumed to be &lt;250 with no subpopulation &gt;50 mature individuals, and the species is assessed as&#160;Critically Endangered (C2a(i)).</a></p>","<p>Historically, the Pondicherry Shark was recorded inshore on continental and insular shelves from 10 to 150 m depth. Reports of it entering rivers have not been verified (Garrick 1985). Maximum size was 102 cm total length (TL); size at birth was &lt;32 cm TL (Ebert<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2013), but its biology remains virtually unknown. Generation length is inferred from another small species of coastal carcharhinid shark, the Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 12 years (Lessa and Santana 1998) resulting in a generation length of 9 years.&#160;</span></p>","<p>Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the range of the Pondicherry Shark (e.g. Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across its range and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for meat and fins. Other small-bodied resilient whaler sharks that are the mainstay of fisheries elsewhere are declining or have collapsed in India, including Spadenose Shark (<em>Scoliodon laticaudus</em>) and 'blacktip' sharks (<em>Carcharhinus</em> spp.) (Mohamed and Veena 2016), and this situation is repeated across the region.<br/><br/>The Pondicherry Shark was likely to be taken by inshore gillnet and line fisheries within its range and its small size suggests that like other small carcharhinids, it was susceptible to trawl fisheries.&#160;In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). This number almost doubled to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating.&#160;In Pakistan waters, about 14,000 fishing vessels, including about 2,000 shrimp trawlers, operate in shallow coastal and offshore shelf waters (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017). In Oman, almost 19,000 artisanal vessels operate in coastal waters using a variety of net and line gear (Jabado and Spaet 2017). These fishing vessel numbers highlight the intensity of coastal and shelf fisheries across the former range of the Pondicherry Shark.&#160;</p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Intensive and largely unregulated coastal fisheries are likely to have driven an historical population reduction in this species. Fisheries across the range of this species have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to growing coastal human population densities driving&#160;increasing fishing effort in traditional shark fisheries in many areas, and international trade in shark products, including the fin trade (e.g. Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2015).&#160;For example, in India during the 1970s, elasmobranch catches doubled due to rapid large-scale mechanization of fishing fleets. Consequently, several small-bodied and relatively resilient whaler sharks, including Spadenose Shark (<em>Scoliodon laticaudus</em>) and 'blacktip' sharks (<em>Carcharhinus</em> spp.), are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>There is only a single known historical record from Oman (Muscat) (Garrick 1985) and on-going fish market surveys in the Gulf and Sea of Oman (e.g. Henderson<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Moore<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2015) have not located any further records.<br/><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">The Pondicherry Shark historically <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">was present in the 1950–60s in the Indus River area of Pakistan. Given that the species has reportedly been known to enter rivers (although Garrick (1985) suggests these claims have not been verified), this may have been a historically important site for it. Efforts to search for the species in this area since the early 1980s have failed to document it (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017). Furthermore, the catch of Pakistani fishing vessels&#160;has been extensively monitored at major landing centres since 1987 but no Pondicherry Shark have been recorded (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>There are several historic records in museum collections from India, but reporting of the species in the Indian literature is somewhat confusing, and descriptions and photographs are not available to verify claims of catches. It was certainly present historically on the west coast (Garrick 1985).&#160;Compagno&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2003) stated that the most recent record of the species in India (and indeed anywhere) was from 1979, but the location of any associated specimen could not be determined for this assessment. Raje<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;(2007) report an individual of 299 cm total length (TL) from Mumbai, but this is most certainly a misidentification as that far exceeds the expected maximum size of 102 cm TL (Ebert<span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em><em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2013); Raje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) report catches landed at Mumbai up until 2002, but again the sizes presented (including a mature male at 248 cm TL) suggest another larger carcharhinid species; and, Raje<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;(2002) report a number of gravid females from the Gulf of Mannar, but this claim cannot be verified.

Records of the species are patchy and spread widely across the Indo-West Pacific from Oman to China. For the purposes of this assessment, the range was considered – at least historically – to be continuous in coastal areas between those locations and thus surveys that occurred across the region were considered for the Records and Survey Model.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The Threats Model (Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017) considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the life history traits that determine the species' susceptibility to these threats. There is a long history of intensive coastal fisheries throughout the tropical Indo-West Pacific and the region includes many of the world’s largest shark fishing nations (including some with Pondicherry Shark records e.g. Indonesia, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan) and global hubs of shark fin trade (e.g. Hong Kong). Intensive and largely unregulated fishing pressure that has driven major declines in sharks across Asia and the Indo-West Pacific more broadly is considered the major threat facing the Pondicherry Shark.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The life history of the Pondicherry Shark is unknown, however the family Carcharhinidae is well-studied. The maximum known size of this species is 102 cm TL and smaller-sized carcharhinids are among some of the faster-growing and biologically productive sharks, although still characterized by low rates of natural mortality and low fecundity. Therefore, the Pondicherry Shark is considered susceptible to population reduction and depletion as a result of threats operating across its range (with little spatial refuge), but not to the degree of many other elasmobranchs. The probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction&#160;<em>P(local)</em>&#160;was very high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0) and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species was similarly high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0). As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00).</p><p>Most records of the species are historic, occurring pre-1960.

The probability that the species would have been recorded is very low (lower = 0; best = 0.005; upper = 0.01) because the species is rare, small and therefore of little economic value and is more likely to have gone unnoticed in mixed catches. Similarly, given the high diversity of <em>Carcharhinus</em> sharks in the Indo-West Pacific together with poor local species-specific separation of catches and identification issues with this species, the probability that the taxon could have been reliably identified is also very low (lower = 0; best = 0.005; upper = 0.01).</p><p>Its range has been subject to considerable survey effort directed at sharks and rays in general over the last 30 years, and some dedicated searches for this species, all of which have failed to produce a verified record.

A small species of ray, the only known specimen was 34 cm total length.

As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00). While there have been no planned surveys to search specifically for this species, there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of elasmobranchs in general in Java since 2001, and it is assumed that these surveys would have documented the presence of the species if it had been recorded. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.84 (minimum = 0.25; maximum = 0.99). The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.82 (both weighting methods).

Its habitat is unknown, but stingarees generally inhabit waters of the continental and insular shelves, although some species occur in deeper slope waters (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016). The life history of the Java Stingaree is unknown; like other urolophids, it is likely to have had low fecundity (as low as 1–2 pups/year; White&#160;<em>et al. </em>2001, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and therefore a limited resilience to overexploitation.","Demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) and the likely former range of the Java Stingaree is subject to intense inshore fishing pressure which is largely unregulated. Rays are captured in Indonesia in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained (White and Dharmadi 2007, Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009, White and Sommerville 2010). Indonesia is the most significant shark fishing nation and is one of the largest exporters of shark and ray meat.<br/><br/>Shallow inshore waters around the Indo-Malay Archipelago are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010). Coastal ecosystems of the heavily industrialized Jakarta Bay are significantly degraded through habitat loss, increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination (See Hosono <em>et al.</em> 2011 and references within). Jakarta is a growing global megacity, and an increasing human population will continue to place stress on the surrounding marine environment.","The only known specimen of the Java Stingaree was collected in 1862, and since that time considerable survey effort in Indonesia has failed to locate any additional specimens. Extensive surveys of landing sites and fish markets have been conducted in Indonesia (e.g. Adrim and Fahmi 2007, White and Dharmadi 2007, Fahmi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fahmi 2012, Supplementary Information). Shark and ray catches at Indonesian landing sites are continually monitored by government agencies and non-governmental organizations and no contemporary specimens or photographs have surfaced.&#160;Despite &gt;28,000 individual rays being examined in eastern Indonesian landing sites (including Jakarta) between 2001 and 2006 (White and Dharmadi 2007), and extensive surveys&#160;in Indonesia (including the Java Sea area) between 2007 and 2020,&#160;the Java Stingaree has not been recorded (Supplementary Information). The species was not recorded in 2015 trawl surveys in the Java Sea, which recorded several species of rays, dominated by stingrays of the family Dasyatidae (Ernawati&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The Framework (Akçakaya <em>et al.</em> 2017) for using the Threats Model (Keith <em>et al. </em>2017) and the Records and Survey Model (Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017) to list species as EX or CR(PE) was applied to the Java Stingaree. Because the species is known from a single specimen collected from a fish market, its range limits and habitat have not been defined. Knowledge of the range of other urolophid species was used to infer the range of the species. Many urolophids have a relatively restricted geographic range (see Last <em>et al.</em> 2016) while others are wider-ranging, but nearly all are restricted to a single country. That records of the Java Stingaree have not been located in adjacent islands, a restricted range is assumed. It is unlikely that the species was restricted to a very small area such as Jakarta Bay, but it is reasonable that it was restricted to the Java Sea. For the purposes of this assessment, threats and surveys that encompassed the Java Sea and the north coast of Java were considered.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The Threats Model (Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017) considered the severity, duration, and scope of threats and their interaction with the life history traits that determine the species' susceptibility to these threats. There is a long history of small-scale and more recently, large-scale fishing in Indonesia which represents the world's number one shark fishing nation in terms of catch. Java is home to numerous large fishing ports and landing sites. The collapse of rays in the Java Sea has been documented and fishers are known to move widely to access resources (e.g. Kalimantan, Papua) as a result of local depletion. Java is the world's most populous island with &gt;140 million inhabitants. Jakarta is a growing global megacity with intense levels of human pressure on coastal habitats and resources and Jakarta Bay is heavily industrialized and coastal ecosystems are significantly degraded through habitat loss, increased eutrophication and sedimentation, and heavy metal contamination. The life history of the Java Stingaree is unknown, however the family is well-studied and species are characterised by some of the lowest fecundities among the elasmobranchs&#160;(as low as 1–2 pups/year; White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, the Java Stingaree is considered highly susceptible to population reduction and depletion as a result of these threats. Accordingly, the probability that the combination of threats affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction <em>P(local)</em> was very high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0) and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species was similarly high (minimum = 0.8; best = 0.9; maximum = 1.0). As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00).<p></p>  <p>The species is known from a single record, the holotype collected in 1862. Therefore, <em>p(ci)</em> was set at 1 (lower; best; upper) following the guidelines. </p>  <p>Passive surveys were set at a moderate level of coverage given the restricted range of the species is extensively covered by fishers who are fishing daily and landing catches locally. Because of the significant human population of Java and the importance of fishing for livelihoods and the economy, it was assumed that the proportion of the species' range covered was 0.5 (lower = 0.4; upper = 0.6). However, the probability that the species would have been recorded is low (lower = 0.1; best = 0.15; upper = 0.2) because the species is rare and very small and therefore of little, if any, economic value and is more likely to have gone unnoticed in mixed catches. Similarly, given the diversity of myliobatiform rays in Java together with poor local species-specific separation of catches, the probability that the taxon could have been reliably identified is low (lower = 0.0; best = 0.1; upper = 0.2).</p>  <p>There have been no planned surveys to search specifically for this species, however there has been considerable survey effort to document landings of elasmobranchs in general in Java, and it is assumed that these surveys would have documented the presence of the species if it had been recorded. An intensive focus on survey effort for elasmobranchs commenced in 2001 (see White and Dharmadi 2007) and some form of survey in West Java, Central Java, Jakarta, and/or the Java Sea has taken place near annually since (Supplementary Information). Prior to 2001, there had been little dedicated survey effort since the early days of ichthyological expeditions (see White <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Surveys that occurred in Jakarta, the Java Sea, or the northern coast of West Java and Central Java were considered in the Records and Survey Model. Surveys of some landing sites that occurred in these areas, but that examined landings from fisheries not likely to interact with the Java Stingaree were excluded (e.g. pelagic longlines). The proportion of the species’ range that was covered varied year by year, but the <em>best </em>value was as high as 0.3 and as low was 0.15. An issue with assigning these values was the spatial footprint of fisheries operating out of landing sites that were surveyed. Fishing vessels can operate outside of Java and the Java Sea, so the surveyed landings may not represent local catches. </p>  <p>The probability that the species would have been recorded in these surveys was set following the suggested default values given in the Instructions for rare species (<em>Instructions for Using Models to List Species as EX or CR(PE)</em> Table 3). The probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the survey if it has been recorded was varied from the suggested default values in the Instructions for species that are not particularly difficult to identify or distinguish from other similar species, and that were searched for by seemingly competent surveyors (<em>Instructions&#160;</em>Table 4). These default values were chosen because the species is the sole member of the family Urolophidae occurring in Java; the only other species from Indonesia is the Kai Stingaree <em>Urolophus kaianus</em> from far eastern Indonesia (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Although the stingray fauna (family Dasyatidae) is diverse in Indonesia, misidentification should not have been a major issue since urolophids are easily separable from dasyatids on account of their short tails with an obvious elongate lobe-like caudal fin.</p>  <p>The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.84 (minimum = 0.25; maximum = 0.99). The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.82 (both weighting methods). Both model results and both weighted averages are &gt;0.5 and &lt;0.9 and therefore fall within the thresholds for Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (Akçakaya <em>et al.</em> 2017). Given the lack of records, the number of mature individuals is assumed to be &lt;50 and the species is assessed as CR(PE) D. </p>",Unknown,"The Java Stingaree is known only from the holotype collected in 1862 from a fish market in Jakarta, Java, Indonesia in the Western Central Pacific (Von Martens 1864, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly susceptible at all life stages to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines operating through most of its range and habitat. Industrial and artisanal fishing pressure is intense and often unregulated in this region and it is suspected that this will continue at the current level or increase in the future. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics and bycatch in fisheries with steadily increasing effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, and many records of angel sharks are only reported to genus level. Along the West African coast this species is taken as occasional bycatch of industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries and was reported as common in Russian-led surveys during the 1970s and 1980s. Portuguese landings data from the fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania, aggregated for the three native angel shark species combined indicates a 95% decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from 1990 to 1998. The available data from this region indicate that there are very few recent records. It is suspected that the species has undergone overall declines of at least 80% across its range over the past three generation lengths (~45 years), and bycatch is likely to continue.

Demersal trawl effort has increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area in the Mediterranean over the last 60 years. The species is also bycaught in trammel nets and bottom-set longlines throughout its range. Human disturbance by habitat degradation and tourism are also possible threats to its preferred soft-bottom nearshore habitat.

Sightings and catches are now rare throughout this species' range, and it is thought that depletion has occurred as a result of historical and ongoing overfishing.<br/><br/><strong>Species-level Population Data:</strong><br/><br/>During the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) Program (1995-1999), a broad scale survey of the north Mediterranean coastline, spanning from West Morocco to the Aegean Sea in depths of 10 to 800 m, the species appeared in only one of a total of 9,095 tows (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/><br/>Ragonese <em>et al. </em>(2013) reported a single capture close to the Gulf of Gabès in 2000 during a GRUND survey covering the area between Sicily, Malta, and Tunisia, at the time the species was confirmed in Libya although as rare. Bradaï <em>et al</em>. (2006) assessed the Sawback Angelshark as regularly observed in the Gulf of Gabès (Tunisia), according to Capapé <em>et al</em>. (2005) who reported the capture of 27 specimens between 1970 and 2002. The species was reported again in Sicily in 2010 (MEDLEM). Hemida (pers. comm. in Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2005) never recorded the species in Algeria between 1996-2005 despite high sampling effort, yet Capape (2005) did encounter this species in Tunisia.<br/><br/>In contrast, there have been sporadic occurrences in the eastern Mediterranean in the Aegean Sea and the Levantine basin during the last 20 years. Damalas and Vassilopoulou (2011) recorded three individuals in the 1995-2000 period in the Central Aegean Sea (whereas none were captured between 2003 and 2006) from 335 bottom trawl hauls. Ünal <em>et al</em>. (2010) also reported its occurrence in the Dardanelles Strait in 2007. Corsini and Zava (2007) reported two captures in 2004 and 2006 in the southern range of the Aegean Sea, and another one was provided by Filiz <em>et al</em>. (2005) from the coasts of Turkey. Off Turkish waters in the Levantine Basin, individual records occurred in 1997, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were reported by Başusta (2002), MEDLEM, Erguden and Bayhan (2015) and Başusta (2016), respectively. Furthermore, Saad <em>et al</em>. (2006) stated that Sawback Angelsharks were captured during scientific surveys off Syria between 2001 and 2004. Finally, Golani (2006) assessed it as a rare species off the Mediterranean coasts of Israel, and Hadjichristophorou (2006) did not include it in the Cyprus checklist of fishes.<br/><br/>There are little species-specific data from the West African coasts, however, this species was previously reported as common in Russian-led surveys in this region during the 1970s and 1980s (F. Litvinov pers. comm. 2006). Capapé <em>et al</em>. (2005) stated that Sawback Angelsharks were relatively abundant in the eastern tropical Atlantic, especially off the coast of Senegal.<br/><br/><strong>Genus-level Population Data:</strong><br/><br/>In addition to species-specific data, there are a number of datasets which include aggregated angel shark (<em>Squatina</em> spp.) landings/records, due to the difficulty of identifying to species level                  and lack of impetus to record to species level. These records could indicate the potential presence of the Sawback Angelshark. For example, off the Balearic Islands <em>Squatina</em> spp. were historically documented in checklists (Barceló and Combis 1868, Fage 1907). Captures of angel sharks were relatively frequent until the 1970s, becoming increasingly sporadic during the 1980s in coastal artisanal fisheries (trammel nets and gillnets), trawls and bottom longline fisheries. For example, records from a Balearic lobster gillnet fishery show that it was common to capture angel sharks on a daily basis until the mid 1980s. But since the mid 1990s no reports of any angel shark species<em> </em>have been reported in the area (G. Morey unpubl. data 2019). Massutí and Moranta (2003) reported no captures of angel sharks from four bottom trawl fishing surveys (131 hauls, at a depth range of 46-1,800 m) carried out between 1996 and 2001 around the Balearic Islands. In addition, the likely low interaction with stocks from other areas further affects the already low recovery capacity of isolated populations such as those around the Balearics.<br/><br/>In the western Mediterranean, Vacchi <em>et al</em>. (2002) reported a dramatic decline of angel sharks in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in the period 1898-1922. Furthermore, fisheries statistics indicate that 180 tonnes of angel sharks were reported landed in Tunisia in 2015, an increase on 125 tonnes in 2014, however nothing is known of the effort associated with these landings (FAO FishStat 2015).<br/><br/>In the West African coasts, artisanal Senegalese fishermen remember angel sharks as common and frequently caught by lines and gillnet 30 years ago; however they appear to have been strongly depleted to the point where they have almost disappeared, now occurring very rarely (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). Catches are now very rare according to both artisanal fishermen and observers of the industrial demersal trawl fleets (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Portuguese landings data from a fleet operating off Morocco and Mauritania (aggregated for Sawback Angelshark<em>, </em>Smoothback Angelshark <em>Squatina oculata</em><em>, </em>and<em> </em>Angelshark <em>Squatina squatina</em>) indicate a significant decline between 1990 and 1998 (ICES 2013). Landings peaked at 35 tonnes (t) in 1990 and the fishery was closed in 1998 when the total landings had dropped to 1.7 t. This represents a 95% decline in landings in eight years, however nothing is known of the pattern of effort associated with these landings.<br/><br/>Overall, given the lack of occurrences in artisanal and commercial fishery surveys, and the ongoing fishing pressure within this species range, a population decline of at least 80% is suspected over the last three generations (45 years).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sawback Angelshark occurs along the southern Mediterranean coast from Algeria to the eastern basin, and along the northern coast from Turkey possibly to Albania.

In the Eastern Atlantic, it is extant in Senegal, The Gambia, and Sierra Leone. Its presence is uncertain in Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Liberia (E.

Regulation ((EU) 2015/2102) Article 16j further reinforces the GFCM measure for EU vessels prohibiting retention, landings and sale, and requiring live release where possible.

All three native angel sharks have been protected within Spanish Mediterranean waters since 2012 through the Spanish List of Species Under Special Protection (LESPRE) Orden AAA/75/2012. In Maltese waters angel sharks have been protected since 2013. Furthermore, Israel listed all shark species under domestic regulations (Ariel and Barash 2015), although enforcement is low. In April 2018 through Communique 2018/19, the Turkish Government announced updates to Article 5 of the Turkish Prohibited Species lists (Communique 2016/35), with the addition of 14 elasmobranch species, which includes the three species of angel shark found in the Mediterranean. This species is included in the attached Supplementary Information: 'Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy' (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017). The goals of the strategy are to: i) minimize fishery mortality; ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), implementing GFCM measures, including listing of the species in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and possibly listing on the Convention of Migratory Species pending data confirming migratory behavior (Gordon <em>et al. </em>2017).</p><p>The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (<a href=""www.angelsharknetwork.com"">www.angelsharknetwork.com</a>).

Formerly the species was a common ambush predator over large areas of its coastal and outer continental shelf soft sediment habitat at depths of 10 to 500 m in the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Atlantic. Most of this region has, and continues, to be subject to intense demersal fisheries, and the species is highly catchable from birth as retained bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, bottom longlines, and dredges. As a result of its limiting life history characteristics (slow growth and late maturation) and fisheries that have steadily increased in effort and capacity, its abundance has declined dramatically during the past 50 years to the point where it is now apparently locally extinct in parts of the northern Mediterranean and West African coasts. It is now extremely uncommon throughout most of the remainder of its range and is thus inferred to have undergone a decline in area of occupancy. Along the West African coasts this species is caught and retained as bycatch in industrial trawl and artisanal gillnet fisheries, and was reported as common in Russian surveys during the 1970s and 1980s.

(1990) reported the occurrence of Smoothback Angelsharks at a depth range 50-200 m (and probably down to 300 m) in Tunisian waters, except for gravid females and young-of-the-year, suggesting that shallow waters in the Gulf of Tunis may act as a parturition and nursery area. Surveys off the West African coast indicate that the species may form aggregations in December (Litvinov 1993).<br/><br/> Age at maturity, longevity, and reproductive age are all unknown. Females are reported to mature at 100 cm total length (TL) from Tunisian waters (Capapé <em>et al</em>. 1990) and 89 cm TL from Senegal (Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2002), males at 71 cm TL from Tunisia (Capapé <em>et al</em>. 1990) and 82 cm TL from Senegal (Capapé et al. 2002).

The species appears to still be present in the central Aegean Sea, but it is likely rare as Damalas and Vassilopoulou (2011) recorded only one individual to be present in 335 bottom trawl hauls conducted between 1995 and 2006. Bileçenoglu <em>et al</em>. (2014) recorded this species as occurring in the Sea of Marmara, Aegean Sea and Levantine Sea. The two more recent records of the species came both from the southeastern Aegean Sea: Rhodes island (Corsini and Zava 2007) and Akyaka (Turkey; J. Barker, pers. comm. cited in Miller 2015).<br/><br/>This species is also present off the North Africa coastline, for example, as reported for the Tunisian Gulf of Gabès coast (Quignard and Othman 1978). Capapé <em>et al</em>. (1990) recorded 108 specimens and 60 young-of-the-year in Tunisian waters (period not specified), suggesting the shallow waters of the Gulf of Tunis could be a parturition and nursery area. Bradaï <em>et al</em>. (2006) considered Smoothback Angelsharks to be regularly observed in the Gulf of Gabès, and the species was confirmed off the Libyan coast (Lamboeuf <em>et al</em>. 1995). As stated by Miller (2015), UNEP (UNEP-MAP RAC/SPA 2005) reported the species as being relatively common in Libyan waters but provided no corresponding citation or data to support this statement. Data for Egyptian waters could not be found.<br/><br/>There are little species-specific data from the West African coasts, although Fager and Longhurst (1968) recorded its presence in the Gulf of Guinea. This species was previously reported as common in Russian surveys in this region during the 1970s and 1980s (F. Litvinov pers. comm. 2006). Capapé <em>et al</em>. (2002) reported both Smoothback Angelshark and Sawback Angelshark (<em>Squatina aculeata</em>) as regularly captured off the coast of Senegal, generally by demersal gill nets and by anglers, in the shallow coastal waters at a maximum depth of 80 m over sandy-muddy bottoms. As stated in Miller (2015), Hureau and Monod (1973) also referred to the species as “rather common” in the Eastern Atlantic from Morocco to Angola. During 1981-1982, a Norwegian research vessel conducted trawl surveys off West Africa from Aghadir to Ghana, where<em> </em>Smoothback Angelshark was the only <em>Squatina</em> species caught, with catch rates of 45.6 kg/hour off the coast of The Gambia, 13.4 kg/hour off Sierra Leone, and 12.4 kg/hour off Liberia (Strømme 1984). In 2001, Smoothback Angelsharks were reported as occurring off the coast of Ghana, but individuals were rarely landed (Edwards <em>et al</em>. <a style=""mso-comment-reference: T_4;mso-comment-date:20170810T1247"">2001</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_4"" href=""#_msocom_4"" name=""_msoanchor_4""></a>). Based on the information from the SIAP databases, the species was recorded rather sporadically in the surveys (dating 1962-2002), with a few years with reports of more than 20 individuals, primarily from surveys conducted off Senegal (Miller 2015). In Sierra Leone, <em>Squatina</em> species were periodically caught by demersal trawlers in the 1980s, but were caught very infrequently in the 1990s and early 2000s (M. Seisay pers comm. 2006). 62 individuals have been caught in the research surveys held in the FIAS database, with additional reports of 40 landings between 2008 and 2011 (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017). It is suspected that most of these records are of juveniles, based on the weight of the captures. Only five individuals were caught in Guinea between 1986 and 2002 and none were caught in Mauritania. Another record from Guinea was confirmed in 2017 (E. Meyers unpubl. data 2017). In Senegal a total of 51 individuals weighing 56 kg were caught from 1971 to 2000 and none have been recorded in recent surveys. In The Gambia six individuals weighing 6 kg were caught from 1986 to 2000, and none have been caught since (FIAS unpub. data).<strong><br/><br/>Generic Angel Shark Data (<em>Squatina </em>spp.)</strong>:<br/>Maynou <em>et al</em>. (2011) concluded that in the Catalan Sea the genus <em>Squatina</em> became practically extinct probably before 1959. The species is likely to have been extirpated from the Balearic Islands, where captures of <em>Squatina</em> spp. were relatively frequent in artisanal fisheries, bottom trawls and bottom longlines until the 1970s, after which captures became sporadic. Vacchi <em>et al</em>. (2002) reported the dramatic decline in the elasmobranch catch of a tuna trap operating in Baratti (Northern Tyrrhenian Sea) between 1898 and 1922. For the genus <em>Squatina</em>, catches decreased from an average of 134 specimens from the period 1898 to 1905, to 95 between 1906 and 1913, and down to 15 between 1914 and 1922. This early decline probably marks the beginning of trawling activity. Furthermore, Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted the disappearance of the <em>Squatina</em> genus from the northern Tyrrhenian Sea in the early 1970s, although Sartor <em>et al</em>. (2010) and Maynou <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported the last catches of <em>Squatina</em> spp. to be made between the late 1970s and early 1980s from off the Italian mainland, whereas their disappearance in Sardinian waters was dated in the mid 1980s.<br/><br/>In the central Mediterranean, fisheries statistics for Tunisia indicate that 180 tonnes of <em>Squatina</em> spp. were reported landed in 2015, an increase on 125 tonnes in 2014 (FAO FishStat 2015). However, nothing is known of the effort associated with these landings.<br/><br/>In the eastern Atlantic, data from Southern <a style=""mso-comment-reference:T_5;mso-comment-date:20170810T1247"">Portugal</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_5"" href=""#_msocom_5"" name=""_msoanchor_5""></a> also suggest the scarcity of the species in the area, where no specimen of the genus <em>Squatina</em> was recorded from experimental fishery surveys using semi-pelagic longlines and trammel nets (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, the genus&#160;is reported in Portuguese fishery statistics, showing a clear decline in the last 20 years (R. Coelho pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>In West Africa, all landings data (as reported to FAO) are aggregated for all angel sharks. Artisanal Senegalese fishermen remember angel sharks as common and frequently caught by lines and gillnet 30 years ago; however they seem to have been depleted to the point where they have almost disappeared, now occurring very rarely (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006). Catches are now very rare according to both artisanal fishermen and observers of the industrial demersal trawl fleets (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Overall the Smoothback Angelshark is suspected to have undergone declines of at least 80% over the past three generations (45 years). </span></span></p>          <a name=""_msocom_1""></a>",Decreasing,"<p>                      </p>Historically, the Smoothback Angelshark occurred in the Mediterranean from France and Tunisia to the eastern basin and the Sea of Marmara.

The species has not been reported from many areas in the region over the past several decades, and may now be absent from some areas that have been subject to heavy fishing pressure.","<p>The species is retained for consumption of meat and liver oil. Off the coasts of Senegal it was frequently landed throughout the year and their fins were specially collected and prepared under the vernacular native name of “laâf” and exported (Capapé&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002). At Ouakam, Senegal, the livers were removed from a great number of specimens with their oil extracted using traditional methods and used to protect fermented dried fishes from infestation by <em>Dermestes</em> spp. and other insect damage. This referred to adult specimens, the smallest ones being generally rejected by fishermen and thus not landed.</p>",Marine,"<p>                      </p>                      <p>The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean has adopted a measure (GFCM/36/2012/3) to prohibit retention, landings, transhipment, storage, display, and sale of 24 species including the three native Mediterranean <em>Squatina</em> species listed on the Barcelona Convention’s Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean. Regulation ((EU) 2015/2102) Article 16j further reinforces the GFCM measure for EU vessels prohibiting retention, landings and sale, and requiring live release where possible. Greater implementation would improve the effectiveness of all measures previously listed.<br/><br/>All three native angel sharks have been protected within Spanish waters in the Mediterranean since 2012 through the Spanish List of Species Under Special Protection (LESPRE) Orden AAA/75/2012. All three species of Mediterranean angel sharks have been protected within Maltese waters since 2013, when they were included in Environment and Development Planning Act (Cap. 504) under Schedule VI “Animal and plant species of national interest in need of strict protection”. Furthermore, Israel listed all shark species under domestic regulations (Ariel and Barash 2015), although enforcement is insufficient. In April 2018 through Communique 2018/19, the Turkish Government announced updates to Article 5 of the Turkish Prohibited Species lists (Communique 2016/35), with the addition of 14 elasmobranch species including all three species of angel shark found in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>This species is included in the attached Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017). The goals of the strategy are to: (i) minimize fishery mortality; (ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, (iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the Strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), implementing GFCM measures, including this species in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), and possibly listing on the Convention of Migratory Species pending data confirming migratory behaviour (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (<a href=""www.angelsharknetwork.com"">www.angelsharknetwork.com</a>).

It is demersal on the continental shelf from the surf zone to 400 m depth. It may overlap in distribution with the Pacific Angelshark (<em>S. californica</em>)&#160;and hence there is uncertainty in the identification of specimens and the distribution boundary, particularly in the northern part of its range.&#160;This species is taken as retained bycatch of trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout its range and the meat is used locally for human consumption. The fisheries within the core part of its range have generally been increasing in effort and catches have declined. In Peru, while effort has been increasing rapidly, landings of this species have declined from a peak of around 250 t in 1995 to 7 t in 2012, the equivalent of a population reduction of 99% over three generation lengths (69 years) and these patterns of decline are expected to continue.&#160;<span class=""sheader2"">Historically, this species was targeted in Chile and anecdotal evidence from fishers suggest it has since disappeared.

Overall, it is suspected that the&#160;Chilean Angelshark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generations (69 years) based on a declining presence in landings despite increasing effort, which is expected to continue into the future, and anecdotal evidence of disappearance from other parts of its former range, and it is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd+3d.</span></p>",The Chilean Angelshark is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 400 m (García&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is&#160;lecithotrophic viviparous. Generation length is likely to be similar to that of the Pacific Angelshark at 23 years (Cailliett&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992).,"The Chilean Angelshark is mainly taken as retained bycatch of trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout its range and angel sharks (Squatinidae) are known to be highly susceptible to capture by trawl and net fisheries (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Colombia and Ecuador, this shark&#160;is taken as bycatch of the shrimp trawl fishery at depths to 80 m (Puentes <em>et al.</em> 2007). In Ecuador, it is taken in bycatch of the multi-purpose hake and shrimp fishery (García&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014) and is also captured with surface longline, trawl, bottom-set gillnet, and bottom longline (Martínez-Ortíz <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Peru, it is taken in target artisanal fisheries, mostly by gillnet but also some other gears. The bulk of the landings are from northern Peru, but landings are reported from the whole coast. Furthermore, it is taken as bycatch of the Peruvian hake fishery (Elliot <em>et al. </em>2003).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Historically, in Ecuador, this species was subject to heavy fishing pressure, from southern Manabi to the Santa Elena Península, between 1995–2001&#160;due to the trade demand from Peru. It was captured using gillnets which were constructed specifically to catch Angel Shark 'Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina californica</em>)' and it was common to record between 200–450 specimens per boat per fishing trip. Currently,&#160;there is no directed fishery and there is no knowledge of the status of the resource&#160; (Martínez-Ortíz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Similarly, historically, this angel shark was targeted in Chile and there is anecdotal evidence from fishers indicating it has disappeared (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;After the target species, this is the&#160;second most important bycatch species captured in the flounder gillnet fishery in the Bay of Coquimbo (Hernandez <em>et al. </em>2010).

116841596,39329,Squatina argentina,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2017-08-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Argentine Angelshark (<em>Squatina argentina</em>)<em> </em>is a small (to 138 cm total length) demersal shark species that occurs in waters in the Southwest Atlantic from Santa Catarina, Brazil, south to Buenos Aires, Argentina. This species inhabits sandy substrates at depths of 51-320 m. The species has a relatively slow life history, giving birth to 7-11 pups with a biennial or possibly triennial reproductive cycle. The Argentine Angelshark is targeted and/or caught as bycatch in demersal trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries, and is sold and utilized for human consumption (although angel sharks are protected in Brazil). Angel sharks are notoriously difficult to identify, and catches are typically reported at the generic level and therefore include at least three species that are native to the region (the Argentine Angelshark, the Hidden Angelshark (<em>S. occulta</em>), and the Angular Angelshark (<em>S. guggenheim</em>)). Declines in CPUE during research trawls in southern Brazil indicate that the population declined substantially in the mid-late 1990s. Further research data corroborates this, indicating the equivalent of a reduction of more than 90% over three generation lengths (46.5 years). There is also heavy fishing pressure in Uruguay and Argentina, where the Argentine Angelshark is caught alongside the Hidden Angelshark and the Angular Angelshark. Landings data indicate a reduction of angel sharks in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone of over 70% over three generations, and datasets further south in Argentina indicate a reduction of over 90% over a similar timeframe (although these landings likely consist mostly of Angular Angelshark). Due to heavy fishing pressure across its range, reported declines in landings and research surveys, and the species' low productivity, it is inferred that this species has undergone, on balance, a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years). Therefore, the Argentine Angelshark is listed as Critically Endangered A2bd. Strict regulations for limits to fisheries catch are needed, as is the identification and protection of critical habitat.","The Argentine Angelshark is a demersal shark that inhabits shelf and upper slope waters between 51 and 320 m depth (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is an ambush predator and prefers soft substrates, especially sand. Like other angel sharks, the Argentine Angelshark is lecithotrophic viviparous with two functional ovaries (Vooren and Klippel 2005). This species gives birth to 7-11 pups (Vooren and da Silva 1991), with most females carrying 9 or 10 young (Vooren and Klippel 2005). The reproductive cycle is two to three years. This species reaches a maximum size of 138 cm total length (TL) and matures at approximately 120 cm TL for both sexes (da Silva 1996). Argentine Angelsharks are estimated to have a generation length of approximately 15.5 years, based on the similarly-sized and closely-related Hidden Angelshark (Vooren and Klippel 2005).","The Argentine Angelshark is threatened by being caught as bycatch in demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries, and it was also previously targeted. <br/><br/>In southern Brazil, directed fisheries using bottom-gillnets on the outer shelf and upper slope developed rapidly between the 1990s and early 2000s and depleted this species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). At the beginning of the 2000s, another fishery developed in the area for the anglerfish&#160;<em>Lophius gastrophysis</em> with bottom gillnets at depths of 130 to 600 m, and this species was caught as bycatch (Perez and Wahrlich 2005, Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). Since 2004, both of these fisheries have been closed, but angel sharks are still captured illegally by trawl and gillnet fisheries and landed without skins in clandestine ports (Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>The nocturnal habits of angel sharks render them susceptible to bottom gillnets which are set at night, and increases in captures during the 1990s are attributed to the introduction of this gear on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil at that time. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>Part of this species' southern distribution in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone overlaps with the Patagonian scallop (<em>Zygochlamis patagonica</em>) bottom trawl fishery, which is likely to catch this species as bycatch.","Angel shark identification in the Southwest Atlantic is difficult, and therefore catches are typically reported for the genus rather than at the species level. There are three species with overlapping ranges, depths, and habitat types in the region (Angular Angelshark, Argentine Angelshark, and Hidden Angelshark), and all are likely to face similar threats and fishing pressure.<strong><br/><br/>Southern Brazil</strong><br/>Angel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and significant reductions have been documented there. In the mid-1980s, the Argentine Angelshark was common and abundant in scientific  research trawls on the outer shelf and upper slope of Rio Grande do  Sul (Vooren and Klippel 2005). During this period, commercial fishing in the area had not yet begun, and a  resident population of this species with high natural abundance existed. Annual catches of angel shark (<em>Squatina </em>spp.) peaked at about 2,000 t in 1986-1989 and again in 1993, and then decreased to 900 t in 2003 (equivalent to a reduction of 93% over three generations). Angel shark CPUE by otter trawl and pair trawl during research cruises on the continental shelf decreased by about 85% from 1984 to 2002 (CEPERG 2003, Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).               <br/><br/>An angel shark bottom gillnet fishery commenced around 1990 and angel sharks used to be caught in the 2000s in large amounts by this gear (Miranda and Vooren 2003). Detailed analysis of two independent sets of scientific fishing data at  depths of 100-500 m constitutes evidence that between 1986 and 2002 the  abundance of both<em> </em>Hidden and Argentine Angelsharks experienced a reduction of around 80% on the shelf and upper slope in the area between Cabo de Santa Marta Grande (28°40’S) and Arroio Chuí (33°50’S), which is equivalent to a reduction of &gt;98% over three generations.  Data on scientific fishing and commercial fishing together are evidence  that between 1986 and 2002 there was a reduction of about 80% for angel sharks on the southern Brazilian slope (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Another dataset indicates that there was an 86% reduction in Argentine Angelshark between 1986 and 2001 (R. Barreto unpubl. data 2018).<br/><br/>Research trawl surveys of the outer shelf in the years 1986/87 and 2001/02 confirmed that in southern Brazil the abundance of Angular Angelshark has decreased to 15% of its original level and this is attributed to recruitment overfishing primarily due to the bottom gillnet fishery (Vooren and Klippel 2005). <br/><br/><strong>Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ)<br/></strong>The Argentine Angelshark is uncommon in Uruguay and Argentina in  commercial landings but is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Uruguay, angel sharks are caught by trawling on the platform and declared as “angelito”. Annual catches of Angular, Argentine, and Hidden Angelsharks together in Uruguay were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch and Domingo 2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between 1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the average declared landings of angel sharks was 277 t and decreased to less than 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is no clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM 2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi <em>et al. </em>(2001) found that Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch.<br/><br/>Argentinian landings in the AUCFZ declined by 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent to a 78% reduction over three generation lengths (CTMFM 2018).<strong><br/><br/><br/>Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)</strong><br/>In Argentina, the three species of the genus are landed together as “pez ángel” and it is probable that more than 90% of the landed angel sharks are Angular Angelshark (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2018). The declared landings of all angel sharks in Argentina decreased by 45% from 2007-2016 with a total of 39509.7 MT and an average of 3950.8 MT (J.-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018), which is equivalent to a reduction of 95% over three generations. Again, it is stressed that these landings trends are probably not appropriate to assign to this species, as most of the landed angel sharks have been Angular Angelshark.<p>Overall, given documented declines in landings and research trawls, the presence of heavy fishing pressure across its range, and its relatively low productivity, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (46.5 years). <br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Argentine Angelshark<em></em> is endemic to the Southwest Atlantic and is found from Santa Catarina State in Brazil to 39°S off Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (Vaz and Carvalho 2013). There is also an unconfirmed report of the species from Rio de Janeiro (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/></p>","<em></em>Although this species is officially protected in Brazil, it is still retained and sold in markets (Almerón-Souza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is used for its meat, which is known locally as <em>cação anjo</em>, which is more valuable than other shark meat marketed simply as <em>cação</em><em></em> (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2017, Almerón-Souza <em>et al.</em> 2018). <br/><br/>In Uruguay, the species is targeted for its meat in gillnet and bottom trawl fisheries and is also caught as bycatch on demersal longlines (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; <br/><br/>In Argentina, this species is not targeted directly in fisheries, but is caught as bycatch in demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries. Angel sharks are sold locally and consumed fresh (<em>pollo de mar</em>) and/or salted and dried (<em>bacalao argentino</em>) (Chiaramonte 1998).",Marine,"<p>In Brazil, trawling in inshore waters is prohibited and all angel sharks are protected, but enforcement of this regulation has been and still is not sufficient (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017). The conservation status of this species will rely heavily upon the successful implementation of these management arrangements. Full observer coverage onboard domestic vessels should provide accurate monitoring of trends in the future. Molecular markers of <em>Squatina</em> spp. have been determined for future  identification of these species in local markets (Falcão <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected area will be increased from 3 nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore. <br/><br/>The Argentine Angelshark is classified as Critically Endangered (A2bd+4bd) in Brazil (ICMBio 2016). The Angular and Hidden Angelsharks are also both classified as Critically Endangered there, and all three of these species are fully protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the normative instructions numbers 5 and 445.&#160; <br/><br/>The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans in the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated by the Binational Technical Comision (<em>Comisión Técnica Mixta del Frente Marítimo</em>). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, the angel sharks <em>Squatina </em>spp. and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between 2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay. <br/><br/>There is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in the Argentine Sea and is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone between 36° and 37°S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km² is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between years and it is applied to all type of vessels using bottom net trawling.<br/><br/>Nursery areas of the species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no take protection in the country. At the same time an assessment of the relative composition of each species in commercial landings in each country is needed.<br/><br/>The species was assessed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to determine whether its status warranted listing under the US Endangered Species Act (Casselberry and Carlson 2015). The species was listed as Endangered as a result in 2017. <br/><br/>Research and monitoring of population size and landings are needed across this species’ range.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Most of this region is now subject to intense demersal fisheries; from birth the species is highly susceptible to bycatch in demersal trawls, set nets, dredges, and bottom longlines, which operate through most of its range and habitat. It is also caught in recreational fisheries, through shore and boat angling, as well as spearfishing. Habitat loss in some areas as a result of coastal commercial and tourism development is also likely to have affected this species. Heavy exploitation combined with limiting life history traits, such as low productivity, have led to dramatic declines during the past 50 years<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. The species is now extremely uncommon throughout most of its range, with the exception of the Canary Islands, which have been identified as a unique stronghold for the species where individuals are sighted regularly by divers and fishers. <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In other areas of its range, occasional sightings are reported, specifically along the coast of Wales (Cardigan Bay) and the West Coast of Ireland, the Tyrrhenian Sea, North Adriatic Sea, Aegean Sea, and Mediterranean coasts of Turkey, Algeria, and Egypt. Its status should be confirmed in these areas and existing and new conservation measures should be implemented and/or introduced as a matter of urgency.    It is inferred that this species has undergone a decline in area of occupancy (AOO). Comparisons of indices of abundance and biomass in various parts of its range of occurrence over extended periods dating back to the early 20th century show declines &gt;90% with no evidence of recovery. Based on these inferred historical declines, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and AOO, and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that declines of at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) have occurred over the past three generations (~45 years). Therefore, the Angelshark is listed as Critically Endangered A2bcd. <br/><p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/></span></p></span>","<p><em></em>The Angelshark is a temperate bottom-dwelling shark of the continental shelves of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, occurring on or near the bottom from close inshore in the shallow sublittoral (&lt;1 m depth) to at least 150 m depth.

Nearly 96% (179) of the recaptures were taken in Irish coastal waters  and only 4% (8) were recaptured from abroad (Quigley 2006).

Demersal trawl effort had increased in both intensity and efficiency on the shelf and slope area of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean over the last 50 years (with reduced effort in some areas in the last decade or so). The species was also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line and spearfishing techniques and this may have been a significant source of mortality in Irish waters (Quigley 2006), and may still be a source of mortality in the Canary Islands (Barker <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; <br/><br/>Degradation of important Angelshark habitat through unsustainable coastal development and coastal infrastructure is of concern, especially in nursery areas identified in shallow inshore waters (Barker <em>et al.</em> 2016). Human disturbance by habitat degradation and tourism are also possible threats to its preferred sandy nearshore habitat. A low rate of exchange between fragmented Angelshark stocks may make them especially prone to local depletion and means that recolonization will likely be extremely low.","<p>There are no range-wide population estimates for the Angelshark. The species was reported to be common, or at least frequently recorded in many areas, during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and early 20<sup>th</sup> century. It was still being caught regularly and considered common in the UK and Mediterranean at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Garstang 1903, Forrest 1907, Lozano Rey 1928).<br/><br/>Steep population declines have, however, now been reported from several parts of this species' range, including the North Sea (ICES 2016), UK coastal waters (Rogers and Ellis 2000), the French coast (Quero and Cendrero 1996, Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2000), and various parts of the Mediterranean Sea (e.g., Ferretti<em> et al</em>. 2005<em>, </em>2013, Fortibuoni <em>et al</em>. 2016). The population has become very fragmented and the Angelshark<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> has now virtually disappeared from much of its former range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean.&#160;The species is now only observed regularly in the Canary Islands, although no accurate estimates on its abundance are available, with occasional records from elsewhere in the Northeast Atlantic (e.g. Welsh Coast (Irish Sea) and the western coast of Ireland (Celtic Sea)).<br/><br/>Records in Wales have been increasing in recent years in areas where  they were known to have been regularly seen in the 1960s and 1970s.  There has been a reduction in fishing effort in Cardigan Bay in recent years. Sixty verified Angelshark records, spanning from 1960 to 2017, were gathered from recreational and commercial fishers in North Wales during a pilot project completed by Natural Resources Wales and Zoological Society of London in 2017 (J. Barker unpublished data 2017).<br/><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><a style=""mso-comment-reference:CG_2;mso-comment-date:20170626T1354"">In the Mediterranean, the species has been reported off the coasts of Tunisia and Algeria, although it was considered rare in the Gulf of Gabès (Bradai 2000). Furthermore, fisheries statistics indicate that 180 tonnes of angel sharks (<em>Squatina</em> spp.) were reported landed by Tunisia in 2015 - an increase from 125 tonnes in 2014. 174 tonnes were landed by Turkey in 2016 (FAO FishStat 2016). However, nothing is known of the pattern of effort associated with these landings. Reports of Angelshark from Turkish waters have increased since the mid-1990s and into the 2010s (Ögretmen <em>et al.</em> 2005, Karakulak <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ismen <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bulguroglu <em>et al.</em> 2014, Ciçek <em>et al.</em> 2014, Kabasakal and Kabasakal 2014, Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2015, Yaglioglu <em>et al.</em> 2015, MEDLEM database), although numbers are still very low and this apparent increase could be due to more attention being paid to reporting angel shark catches.</a><br/><br/>Data from scientific trawl surveys in the Mediterranean (mainly the  Mediterranean International Trawl Survey—MEDITS—and the Italian  National Project (National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation—GRUND)) are in agreement with what is stated above. Catch data series  from 1985 show a very low density of Angelshark in the northern Mediterranean - only two individuals were captured in 6,336 hauls between 1994 and 1999 (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>The ICES Working Group on Elasmobranch Fisheries (WGEF) considered that “comparisons  of historical data with the near-absence in recent data (landings,  surveys, observer programs, angling data)  are sufficient to consider the species to be severely depleted in the  Celtic Seas ecoregion and possibly extirpated from the North Sea  ecoregion” (ICES 2016), supporting the view it is locally extinct in the latter area. ICES WGEF also noted that “Whilst  its status in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coastal waters is unknown,  it is considered very rare, with only occasional individuals reported”.<br/><br/>In the Northern Tyrrhenian Sea, Vacchi <em>et al.</em> (2002) and Ferretti <em>et al.</em> (2005) reported the steep decline (&gt;90%) of angel sharks (all three species in the region), beginning as early as between 1898 and 1922.&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Trawl surveys in that area between 1972 and 2004 did not find any species of angel shark, suggesting declines of the genus until extirpation (Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2005). In the Adriatic Sea, Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2013) found a similar pattern, where the last report of Angelshark from five different scientific trawl surveys covering the period 1948-2005 dated back to 1958. Similarly, Fortibuoni <em>et al</em>. (2016) reviewed the historical occurrence of Angelshark in the Northern Adriatic, reporting declines &gt;90% and showing the collapse of the species in the early 1970s, even though they reported its current presence there. Maynou <em>et al</em>. (2011) stated that Angelsharks are likely to have disappeared in the Catalan Sea by 1959. In western Italy, Angelsharks would have disappeared by the early 1980s near the mainland and the mid-1980s in Sardinia. Declines have also been reported from studies off the Balearic Islands where this species, previously relatively frequent, may now be absent. Massutí and Moranta (2003) reported no captures of any species of&#160; angel shark&#160;from four bottom trawl fishing surveys (131 hauls, at a depth range of 46 to 1,800 m) carried out between 1996 and 2001 around the Balearic Islands.<br/><br/>Based on these historical declines inferred through changes in CPUE, a suspected decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO), and the contemporary rarity of the species, it is suspected that the Angelshark population size has been reduced by at least 80% (but likely closer to 90%) over the past three generations (~45 years).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Angelshark originally ranged from Scandinavia to Northwestern Africa (Morocco and the Canary Islands), including the Mediterranean and Black Seas.

In the Balearic Islands, the term “escatera” also existed, and was also used until mid-20<sup>th</sup> century (Morey <em>et al</em>. 2006).  The Angelshark has been utilized by humans as a source of food for thousands of years. Its meat, considered light and easily digestible, was sold fresh or dried and salted, while its skin (shagreen) was used for polishing wood and ivory (Donovan 1802). The use of this species as food has continued into modern times and it also represents a source for shark liver oil and fishmeal (Fortibuoni <em>et al</em>. 2016).  Given the coastal nature of the species, it was also subject to fishing pressure from recreational fishing in parts of its range, including the Canary Islands and off the coasts of Ireland and Wales (ICES 2016).<br/><br/>The level of use and trade in this species in West Africa is unclear.

The goals of the strategy are to: i) minimize fishery mortality; ii) identify and protect areas critical to angel shark survival, reproduction, and recovery; and, iii) identify human interactions and minimize the negative impacts. Policy priorities from the Strategy include (but are not limited to) listing the species on Spanish domestic fishery regulations (in process), and implementing GFCM measures, and including two additional species (Sawback Angelshark <em>Squatina aculeata</em> and Smoothback Angelshark <em>S. oculata</em>) in EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (Gordon <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The Angel Shark Conservation Network was created with the aim to facilitate collaborations and collect information about angel sharks throughout their range (www.angelsharknetwork.com). For this purpose, an interactive map (<a href=""www.angelsharknetwork.com/#map"">www.angelsharknetwork.com/#map</a>) was created to register sightings.<br/><br/>In 2018, Natural Resources Wales and Zoological Society of London launched the Angel Shark Project: Wales, a data gathering project that works with commercial and recreational fishers, communities in five focal areas and divers to gather historic and current Angelshark records in the region (<a href=""www.angelsharknetwork.com/wales"">www.angelsharknetwork.com/wales</a>). A Wales Angelshark Action Plan will be developed with all partners involved at the end of the project, to identify ways to ensure continued presence of Angelsharks in Wales. <br/></span></span></p><p><br/></p><p>&#160;</p>        <a name=""_msocom_8""></a>  <p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span lang=""EN-CA""><br/></span></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Europe
121035795,39394,Rhynchobatus djiddensis,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) is a large (to 310 cm total length) shark-like ray which is widespread in the Western Indian Ocean from South Africa to the Arabian/Persian Gulf. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore (including the surf zone) to depths of 70 m (usually shallower than 35 m). The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Whitespotted Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;</em>has been used extensively for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific, but it is now considered to occur only in the Western Indian Ocean. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Whitespotted Wedgefish has litter sizes of ~4&#160;pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Whitespotted Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while most of these datasets are outside the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). While similar data are not available for the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (with the exception of the Iran dataset which shows a 91% population reduction over the last three generations), actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species with the exception of South Africa, and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines have not occurred in the Western Indian Ocean. The Whitespotted Wedgefish has been targeted in East Africa, and there is anecdotal reports suggesting population reduction in countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, and Madagascar. In South Africa, there has been a marked decline in the catch-per-unit-effort of Whitespotted Wedgefish in shark bather protection nets in KwaZulu Natal. However, this decline may not be a good indicator of abundance, as it may be explained, at least partially, by a shift in gear deployment whereby nets were gradually lifted off the substrate. Fishing pressure is less intensive in South Africa than elsewhere, but this country represents the southern extent of the species' range and only a small proportion of its distribution. Overall, it is inferred that the Whitespotted Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Whitespotted Wedgefish occurs from close inshore (including the surf zone) to depths of 70 m on the continental shelf (usually shallower than 35 m) (van der Elst 1988, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Maximum size is 310 cm total length (TL) (typically smaller); males mature at ~150 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with a small litter size ~4 pups; size at birth is ~60&#160;cm TL (van der Elst 1988, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information). The species appears to be partially migratory, as it is common in coastal waters of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa during the summer, with tagged animals traveling a mean distance of 49 km, reflecting locals movements only, while it occurs in much lower numbers during the winter; presumably it migrates northwards into warmer waters (van der Elst 1988, Young 2001, Mann 2003).","<p></p><p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and in Madagascar, the number of pirogues (small-scale fishing boats) rose from ~5,000 in 1983 to ~22,000 in 1996 (Cooke 1997). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Oman (19,000 artisanal boats) and Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Cripps&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Barrowclift&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Whitespotted Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g., Pierce <em>et al. </em>2008, Humber <em>et al.</em> 2017, Jabado 2018), with the exception of South Africa, and its distribution includes Iran which ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally (Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In South Africa, the Whitespotted Wedgefish is caught in prawn trawl fisheries, shark bather protection nets, and recreational fisheries (Dudley and Cliff 1993, Fennessy 1994, Pradervand <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion).&#160;In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, there are several relevant historical accounts and more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. While only one of the contemporary datasets is from the known range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (the landings dataset from Iran), these are considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu <em>et al.</em> 2018, Yusup <em>et al. </em>2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran (see below), Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30–45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p><br/>To expand on point four above in relation to Iran (a range state of the Whitespotted Wedgefish), landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (<em>Rhina ancylostoma</em>), Bottlenose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus australiae</em>), Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>R.</em><em>&#160;djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Whitespotted Wedgefish (45 years).<br/><br/>While this is the only time-series data available for the range of the Whitespotted Wedgefish, fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of this species with the exception of South Africa (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines have not occurred across large areas of the Western Indian Ocean. The following provides some species-specific examples of the situation relevant for the Whitespotted Wedgefish which supports this conclusion. </p><p>In southern Mozambique, anecdotal reports suggest that artisanal longline fishing led to declines in the Whitespotted Wedgefish (which was one of the main target species of the fishery) as this species was abundant on reefs before longline fisheries began in the early 2000s and subsequently are only seen in low numbers&#160;(Pierce&#160;<em>et al. </em>2008). In Zanzibar, fisher interviews indicated that there were perceived declines in wedgefish or that they are rare (Schaeffer 2004); wedgefishes were a retained bycatch of commercial prawn trawling in Tanzania (Rose 1996), and intense fishing pressure across the Tanzanian shelf is likely resulted in population reduction mirroring those outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific more broadly. In Madagascar, there was a decrease in the size of wedgefish caught in artisanal fisheries over time (Humber <em>et al. </em>2017), thought, in part, could be due to the targeting of larger individuals. A steep decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) can be inferred from reported catch reductions from 10-20 sharks per day in 1992 to 1-3 sharks per day in 1995 in Morondava, West Madagascar, with fishers moving further afield to fish (Cooke 1997). Whitespotted Wedgefish, a high-value target species, would likely have declined by a similar order of magnitude.<br/><br/>In South Africa, although the Whitespotted Wedgefish&#160;reaches the Eastern Cape Province, it is common only in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). There was a marked decline in CPUE of the species in shark bather protection nets in KZN during the period 1979-2017 (Nomfundo Nakabi, KZN Sharks Board, pers. comm. 2018). This decline is not considered to be a good indicator of population reduction as it may be explained, at least partially, by shift in gear deployment whereby nets were gradually lifted off the substrate (which would reduce the capture of demersal rays).<br/><br/>Overall, it is inferred that this species has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction due to actual levels of exploitation over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Whitespotted Wedgefish is widespread in the Western Indian Ocean from South Africa to Oman and the Arabian/Persian Gulf, but it may not be present further east (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). However, the species' distribution may not be fully defined due to confusion with other members of the&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;</em>species-complex.","<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;</a>While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018).

Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue. The Whitespotted Wedgefish is protected in South Africa; catching or possession of the species is not legal without a valid permit. India has protected&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;since 2001 under Schedule 1 of the&#160;<em>Wildlife (Protection) Act</em>&#160;<em>of 1972&#160;</em>making its capture, landing, and trade illegal (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). However, the reclassification of wedgefishes (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) indicated that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;does not occur in India, but the species present there are&#160;<em>R. australiae</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>R. laevis</em>, which are currently not listed under the Act.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The&#160;<em>Bangladesh Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012</em>&#160;protects&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;under Schedule I, but again, the species occurring in Bangladesh are&#160;<em>R. australiae</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>R. laevis&#160;</em>(Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). <br/><br/>In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Kuwait bans the catches of all rays; and in the Red Sea, all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although both countries represent a very small part of the species' range). The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, and Israel. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed.

Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.

Due to its very limited dispersal capabilities, habitat specialization, small population size that is fully restricted to an urbanized estuary, and limited ability to escape predators, it is intrinsically susceptible to disturbance and population decline. The main driver of historical declines that were first detected in the 1980s is not fully understood, but probably includes historical scallop fishing activity, which caused the destruction of its habitat as well as mortality as bycatch. Beyond the closure of this fishery, declines continued mostly due to benthic habitat degradation from predation on ascidians by the introduced Northern Pacific Seastar (<em>Asterias amurensis</em>) and pervasive pollution, siltation and turbidity. Upon recognition of these declines, this species was listed by the Australian government (national) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and under the Tasmanian government (state) Threatened Species Protection Act, which prohibits capture of this species except under scientific permits, and mandates the development and funding of recovery plans. A multi-institution effort currently conducts robust monitoring surveys across its entire range, a captive breeding project is underway, artificial spawning substrate has been installed in certain sites, and the public is engaged through active outreach. There have been some observed successes related to these efforts, but analyses using data from recent surveys and reconstructed abundance indices do not indicate that the population has either increased or decreased over the past 18 years, though some subpopulations have independently declined or increased. Beyond these species-specific actions, the Derwent Estuary Program, which is a multi-stakeholder effort operating under the Derwent Estuary Conservation Action Plan, regularly monitors water quality, pollutant loads and extent of contamination. On-the-ground actions have led to improvements, but the estuary remains below the national standard for pollutants and sediment quality.

Females attach small clusters of 60 to 250 large eggs by filaments to stalked ascidians (<em>Sycozoa</em> spp.) and sometimes seagrass, sponges, hydroids or polychaete worm tubes, and parental care is provided until they hatch (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 1997, Last and Gledhill 2009). Newborns directly recruit to the benthos upon hatching and data are limited on hatchling mortality (Wong and Lynch 2017). Maximum standard length is 12 cm, but occurs more commonly from 6 to 7.5 cm (Last and Gledhill 2009). Sexual maturity is reached by 2-3 years of age and about 7 cm with growth slowing significantly afterwards (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 1997).<span style=""""> Longevity is unknown, but is likely greater than 10 years (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;</span>Studies on growth rate suggest that individuals of 10 cm length are between 12 to 16 years of age, although most individuals found in the Derwent estuary are 8.1-9 cm and between 4 to 10 years of age (Green and Bruce 2001, Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004). Based on this information, it is likely this species reaches a longevity of at least 20 years (G. Edgar and R. Stuart-Smith pers. comm. 2018<span style="""">), and ongoing research will likely refine this estimate in the future (T. Lynch pers. comm. 2018). </span>When applying an age at first reproduction of 3 years and longevity of 20 years, its estimated generation length is 11.5 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","<p><span style="""">The major driver of population decline in this species is declines in benthic habitat quality due to historic as well as cumulative and on-going pressures (Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2018). This includes predation on ascidians (preferred spawning substrate) by the introduced Northern Pacific Seastar (<em>Asterias amurensis</em>), which probably began in the early 1990s (T. Lynch pers. comm. 2018), </span>and degradation of the environment in the Derwent Estuary caused by pollution, siltation and turbidity, which also has reduced available spawning substrate (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). A scallop fishery that was active throughout the historical range of this species from the 1800s until collapsing in the Derwent estuary by 1925 and in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel by 1967, also likely contributed (Edgar and Samson 2004, Last and Gledhill 2009, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2015). </p>  <p>In addition, the Derwent Estuary has been recognized by multiple entities as one of the most polluted estuaries in Australia due to port and urban development as well as heavy metal contamination (Bloom and Ayling 1977, Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Ramakrishnan 2016). Besides industries associated with a busy port, this estuary is also home to paper production, zinc smelting and boat building, which are all sources of contaminated wastewater runoff. These stresses have led to declines in sensitive habitats within the estuary, including tidal flats, saltmarshes, seagrasses and kelp forests (Coughanowr <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effects from nutrient and sediment loading have been observed to change algal cover and sediment grain size at Ralphs Bay with the site becoming dominated by ‘ephemeral’ algae and covering the soft sediment microhabitat, shelter and spawning substrates that this species relies on (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wong 2015, Wong and Lynch 2017). In addition, the impact of chain moorings, which are common across the Derwent Estuary, on nearby substrate quality further degrades its preferred habitat (Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2018). Historical declines in bivalve populations may also reduce the availability and/or quality of the preferred micro-habitat of this species and the potential for increased predation by flathead fish (Platycephalidae) and rays in certain areas may directly impact certain subpopulations (Edgar and Samson 2004, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Threats also include the possibility of a catastrophic pollution event, especially in areas of the estuary where ports, heavy industry and intense urbanisation are present (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Given the extremely limited mobility of this species, warming of waters due to climate change is also likely to become a stressor (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). </p>","Intrinsic life history characteristics that include very limited dispersal capabilities, small and highly localized population and limited ability to escape predators contribute to the susceptibility of this species to population decline (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).<span style=""""> Due to their low dispersal capabilities and relatively low reproductive rate,&#160;handfish species occur in isolated subpopulations&#160;(T. Lynch pers. comm. 2018); therefore, this species is&#160;considered severely fragmented since more than half of the individuals are in small and isolated patches.</span>&#160;This species experienced a large population decline during the late 20th century, and now only several micro-subpopulations remain that are spread over about 30 km in the Derwent estuary near Hobart (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was once considered to be common, but increasing rarity was first recognized in the late 1980s (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wong and Lynch 2017). In the 1980s and 1990s, a few isolated populations existed in Frederick Henry Bay, which is outside the Derwent Estuary. Surveys conducted in that area last recorded it in 1999, and despite additional survey effort, it has not been detected since, suggesting local extinction has occurred (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012). Elsewhere outside the estuary, the species was last recorded in Great Oyster Bay between 1909 and 1957, in the Huon estuary in the 1940s, and despite substantial sampling effort over the past half century, it has not been recorded in eastern Tasmania or the Bass Strait (Last and Gledhill 2009). <span style="""">The remnant of its global population is now considered to be fragmented and restricted to 9 sites within the Derwent Estuary&#160;</span>and each of these sites represent separate, isolated subpopulations, with some limited potential for connectivity between adjacent sites (Wong and Lynch 2017). When populations were larger in the past, individuals probably made small movements of up to 150 metres, and up to 500 metres for spawning purposes (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Although significant trends in its global population have not been detected from data collected during surveys conducted over the past 18 years, this species has a much lower abundance in the present than 30 or more years ago and at least one site has declined in the past decade (Wong and Lynch 2017). The largest declines began sometime after 1980, i.e. as much as 38 years ago<span style="""">&#160;(G. Edgar pers. comm. 2018).&#160;</span>In addition, recruitment appears to have been low (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012) and only one high density subpopulation, which is located in the Derwent Estuary, is now known to exist (Wong and Lynch 2017). According to analyses conducted in 2009, an estimated 1,500 to 2,700 total mature individuals remained, and this is known to have further declined since (Commonwealth of Australia 2015). All known extant sites for the species were first surveyed in 2015 and repeated in 2016 (Wong and Lynch 2017).&#160;Besides the population surveys conducted across its known global range in the Derwent Estuary in 2016, additional exploratory surveys conducted in the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk498863484"">D’Entrecasteaux Channel&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk498862480"">recorded two separate individuals within Flathead Bay, which documents that a small, but poorly known, population persists outside the Derwent Estuary</a>. Surveys were also conducted in nearby bays in preferred habitat, but no fish were observed. In the 2015 surveys, 80 total individuals were observed, and 90 were observed in 2016. The total number of fish at each of the nine sites in 2016 ranged between 3 and 19 individuals and the highest density was recorded at Mary-Ann Bay at 30.2 ± 10.1 individuals per hectare and lowest density at Ralphs Bay at 3.19 ± 1.70 individuals per hectare (Wong and Lynch 2017). Mary-Ann Bay is also the site with the highest numbers of ascidians, which is the spawning substrate of this species (Lynch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and sites with low ascidian numbers commonly record low to no fish (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Between the two consecutive survey years, similar densities were found at most sites, except Bellerive and Tranmere recorded a small increase in observations and less were observed at Howrah Beach. From 1998 to 2016, or over the past 18 years, estimated densities across all the sites did not show any significant trend&#160;<a name=""_Hlk498931021"">(Wong and Lynch 2017</a>). The subpopulation at Ralphs Bay declined exponentially from 50 fish per hectare in 2005 to 3.19 fish per hectare by 2016 (Green&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Lynch <em>et al. </em>2016, Wong and Lynch 2017), which represents about a 94% decline over the past 11 years. The subpopulation at Primrose Sands collapsed between 1999 and 2005 (87 individuals to zero), and may be locally extinct (Green 2007, Commonwealth of Australia 2015, Lynch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Wong and Lynch 2017). The relatively wide variation in fish densities across the subpopulations suggest that this species can persist in low or high densities that can vary both annually and seasonally (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Most of the nine Derwent subpopulations have a density between 10 and 20 fishes Ha<sup>-1</sup> (Wong <em>et al</em>. 2018). The minimum overall population size in the Derwent is 850 mature individuals and the D'Entrecasteaux Channel subpopulation has about 100 individuals, which results in a global estimated total population size of at least 950 individuals <span style="""">(G.

Ongoing research to improve population estimates is expected in the future, but based on what is currently known, it is inferred that, over the past three generations, there has been at least a 50% global decline. It is suspected the decline may be as much as 90%.&#160;</span>",Decreasing,"This species is patchily distributed and restricted to the lower Derwent Estuary in Tasmania, Australia.

Capture is totally prohibited for this federally and state-protected species, and punishment for poaching includes heavy fines and/or imprisonment (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scallop dredging is no longer permitted within the range of this species (Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004). <br/><br/>At least three recovery plans have been developed, one for the 1999-2001 time period, the second for 2002-2006 and the third for 2015-2020 (Commonwealth of Australia 2015, Wong and Lynch 2017). A robust monitoring survey is in place to track population trends across its entire range and conservation actions currently include building capacity for a captive breeding project, deploying eco-friendly moorings in critical handfish habitat, and engaging the local community through talks, outreach and publications (Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2018). A multi-institutional collaboration involving volunteer divers (Reef Life Survey, the University of Tasmania Dive Club), researchers (CSIRO, the University of Tasmania), managers (Tasmanian Government, Derwent Estuary Program, Department of the Environment) and industry (Aquenal Pty Ltd., Veolia Pty Ltd) has implemented conservation efforts with some success. This includes education of the public as well as the placement of over 1,500 plastic rods at Sandy Bay, Battery Point and Ralphs Bay to provide artificial vertical substrate for deposition of handfish egg masses (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012, Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In addition, private organisations, government and collaborative programs (e.g., the Derwent Estuary Program) have made significant efforts to mitigate recent and past pollution in the estuary. Under the Derwent Estuary Conservation Action Plan, water quality, pollutant loads and extent of contamination are regularly monitored and communicated via ‘State of the Derwent Estuary’ reports (Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Coughanowr <em>et al</em>. 2015). These actions have resulted in about a 90% reduction in organic inputs and about a 50% reduction in heavy metals, as well as substantial improvements in stormwater treatment, but pollution loads remain well above, and sediment quality well below, national standards (Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Coughanowr <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ramakrishnan 2016).&#160;<p><em>Ex-situ </em>conservation efforts are possible considering this species is known to survive in aquaria and eggs could be harvested from the wild to support such a program (Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Further underwater surveys are urgently needed for all shallow-water handfishes, especially where there are knowledge gaps for their status/existence in suitable habitat along the Tasmanian southeast coast. Further searches are also needed at historical sites previously visited by divers (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).

It typically remains well-hidden in the macroalgal reef underneath <em>Sargassum</em> (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Its maximum total length is 13.6 cm (Last and Gledhill 2009), but most individuals observed are usually less than 9 cm. Handfish species do not have a pelagic larval stage, and dispersal of propagules is very limited (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). Females lay small clusters of 30-60 large eggs attached to vertical substrate such as ascidians and fronds of green alga (<em>Caulerpa</em> sp.) by filaments and some level of parental care is provided until they hatch (Last and Gledhill 2009, Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Stuart-Smith and G. Edgar pers. comm. 2018).&#160;</span>","<p>The threats causing the declines in this species are not well-understood (Commonwealth of Australia 2015), but the main, general threats include loss of spawning substrate, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution and siltation, and increasing densities of native sea urchins&#160;(Commonwealth of Australia 2015).&#160;</p><p>Other shallow handfish species (e.g., <em>Brachionichthys hirsutus</em>) have experienced severe population declines due to their very limited dispersal capabilities, small subpopulations and impacts from invasive species, habitat loss and pollution (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). The only remaining subpopulations of this species are within close vicinity of an urban area that is a likely source of coastal habitat degradation due to nutrient runoff from the adjacent land, pollution, siltation and turbidity. This has manifested itself in the increased presence of filamentous algal cover, which is an inadequate habitat type for this species both for spawning and sheltering purposes. In addition, the seaweed habitat that is preferred by this species for spawning substrate has been reduced due to overgrazing by high densities of sea urchins which is predicated by predator release from the depletion of Rock Lobster (<em>Jasus edwardsii</em>) populations. Direct removal of Red Handfish individuals by poachers for sale in the illegal aquarium trade, the possibility for a large pollutant spill event as well as rising water temperatures associated with climate change also constitute serious threats to this species (Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;&#160;</p>","The global population of this species once consisted of a few subpopulations separated by a few square kilometres, with very limited to no dispersal between them&#160;<a name=""_Hlk499023271"">due to their characteristic low mobility and relatively low reproductive rate&#160;</a>(Last and Gledhill 2009); <a name=""_Hlk499023271"">therefore, this species is considered severely fragmented since more than half of the individuals are in small and isolated patches.&#160;</a>It is known to be naturally rare and difficult to detect due to its cryptic behavior, and surveys conducted by recreational and scientific divers in much of its range indicate that its rarity has increased over time (Last and Gledhill 2009, Edgar<em> et al.</em> 2015, Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). Historical survey data are not available, and therefore, population trends over time are not quantified (Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004, Edgar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). A major population decline is thought to have occurred during the 1900s due to activity by the historical scallop dredge fishery that no longer exists as well as commercial and recreational dredging and land management activities that decreased water and sediment quality (Last and Gledhill 2009, Commonwealth of Australia 2015). <span style="""">The Spotted Handfish (<em style="""">Brachionichthys hirsutus</em>), which is similar to this species in ecology, distribution and size, has experienced documented large-scale declines since the 1980s (Last and Gledhill 2009, Edgar&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2017).</span><br/><br/>It is now only known from two small subpopulations on two reef localities in Frederick Henry Bay.&#160;In the past, subpopulations also existed in Port Arthur, Fortescue Bay, the Actaeon Islands, D'entrecasteaux Channel and the Forestier Peninsula. It was sighted in Fortescue Bay up until 2001. The last sighting in Port Arthur, where it was previously not uncommon in the early 1800s, occurred decades ago. As apparently suitable habitat still remains at these sites, its apparent disappearance from these areas is not understood (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2015). It was observed regularly at the reef in Frederick Henry Bay in the 1990s, but became less common over time (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 1997, Last and Gledhill 2009, Commonwealth of Australia 2015). A total of 100 hours were spent by 19 experienced divers at 22 sites across southern Tasmania from February to June 2015 to specifically search for Red Handfish and Ziebell’s Handfish (<em>Brachiospilus ziebelli</em>), and only four individuals of Red Handfish were detected at a single site (i.e., reef in Frederick Henry Bay; Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). Other survey work in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2017 at this site have found an average of two individuals each time. In 2018, a second smaller subpopulation was found on another reef locality in Frederick Henry Bay&#160;<a style="""">(R. Stuart-Smith pers. comm. 20</a><span style=""""><a>18</a>).&#160;</span>A 2004 report by the Department of the Environment and Heritage estimated that the global population of Red Handfish was restricted to less than 10 sites, an area of less than a few hundred square kilometres and a total of no more than 1,000 individuals. The most recent surveys conducted in 2019 estimate the number of mature individuals (across the two sub-populations)&#160;to be about 100 (R.

124398647,169473392,Glyphis gangeticus,Critically Endangered,A2cd; C2a(i),2021,2021-01-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ganges Shark (<em>Glyphis gangeticus</em>) is a medium-sized (to ~275 cm total length) shark with a patchy distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from Pakistan to Borneo. It is a euryhaline species that inhabits tropical riverine (including freshwater), estuarine, and inshore marine habitats to a depth of 50 m. The species is caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, and industrial fisheries and is retained for its meat and fins. The species is extremely rare with very few known historic and recent records, despite extensive surveys of sharks and rays across its known range. Its reliance on riverine and estuarine habitats makes it particularly susceptible to intensive historic and current fishing pressure and increasing habitat modification and degradation across its entire known range. It has little refuge from these threats. It is possibly locally extinct in Pakistan, Myanmar, and Borneo with recent records only known from west and east India and Bangladesh. It is suspected that the Ganges Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (54 years) due to levels of exploitation and given the rarity of contemporary records, it is estimated that the number of mature individuals of the Ganges Shark is very small (&lt; 250) with an inferred continuing decline due to ongoing intensive and unmanaged fishing pressure and habitat degradation across its entire range, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd; C2a(i).<p>  </p>","The Ganges Shark is euryhaline and occurs in tropical rivers in freshwater and estuarine conditions, in estuaries, and in coastal habitats at depths of 0–50 m (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2010, Weigmann 2016, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019). Juvenile and subadult <em>Glyphis </em>species generally occur in rivers while adults are generally coastal and marine (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015, Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2019, Grant <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2019). Genetic data supports marine dispersal of the Ganges Shark across its known Indo-Pacific range (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015). It reaches a maximum size of 266 cm total length (TL) which was measured (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018); however, jaws collected in Pakistan have been estimated to come from a larger individual of ~275 cm TL (M. Harris pers. comm. 9 June 2017). Males mature at ~178 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is presumed to be placental viviparous, based on other <em>Glyphis </em>spp. and size-at-birth is 56–61 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence generation length is inferred from the euryhaline Bull Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>). The Bull Shark has regional variation in age parameters among tropical and temperate and Indo-Pacific and Western Atlantic regions (see Bull Shark Red List assessment). As the Ganges Shark is a tropical Indo-Pacific species, the generation length from tropical northern Australia, within the Indo-Pacific, is considered the most appropriate, where female age-at-maturity is 9.5 years and maximum age is 26 years, resulting in a generation length of 18 years (Tillet <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The species is caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, and industrial fisheries and retained for its meat and fins. The Ganges Shark occupies large tidal rivers, estuaries and coastal areas. The habitat specificity of the Ganges Shark increases its susceptibility to the impacts of human activities, particularly fishing and habitat modification. The habitat of this species is subject to intense anthropogenic pressure, from river and coastal fisheries, habitat degradation and pollution (including untreated discharge from industrial and chemical plants), increasing river use, sand mining in rivers, power plants, and the construction of dams and barrages which alter flow and affect river productivity (Compagno and Cook 1995, Sen and Mandal 2019). For example, in Pakistan, there are four large dams and 22 barrages on the Indus River, with several more proposed (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2015). Barrages have fragmented the river habitat, with fragment size declining steadily as more barrages were built (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2015). The construction of barrages also led to the collapse of the commercial Hilsa Shad (<em>Tenualosa ilisha</em>) fishery due to the disruption of their migration (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2015). Due to habitat overlap it is likely that this fishery caught juvenile Ganges Shark as bycatch, while net entanglement would be an ongoing threat in the river if juvenile Ganges Sharks persist. Ganges Sharks landed in Karachi and the Manora Basin in the early 2000s were caught by a commercial gillnet fishery that operated mostly in shallow coastal waters south of Karachi, and around the Indus River mouth (M. Harris pers. comm. 9 June 2017).<br/><br/>In India, there is a high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020). The number of trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat (one of the major shark catching regions) has almost doubled from ~ 6,600–11,582 for the period 2000–2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). There are over 80,255 active fishers operating along the West Bengal coast, with most of the mechanized vessels using gill nets (CMFRI 2012). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal and subsistence fishing fleet that operates throughout the Sundarbans and coastal regions (Haque and Das 2019). In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in addition to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishers (Shamsuzzaman <em>et al</em>. 2017, DoF 2018). Fishing effort has increased substantially since 1950 and dramatically in recent years, with a four-fold increase from 2000 to 2014 (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Three specimens of Ganges Shark were caught as bycatch and retained by artisanal fishers in Bangladesh using a range of fishing gear which may have included drift gillnets, trammel nets, and long lines (Haque and Das 2019). Severe habitat degradation is ongoing throughout the Sundarbans and associated rivers. This is driven by high human population density resulting in pollution (general, agricultural, chemical, sewage, and industrial), over-harvesting of fisheries resources, vegetation removal, and upstream river engineering (e.g., Barman 2007, Sen and Mandal 2019, Sievers <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Malaysian Borneo, hydroelectric and reservoir dams, and habitat degradation through land clearing and pollution throughout the area (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2010) may be a significant threat to this species in addition to fishing pressure (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p>  </p>","Genetic data indicate contemporary gene flow in the Ganges Shark between Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Borneo (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, gene flow is contemporary in an evolutionary sense and these data cannot yet resolve the time frame within the past 10,000 years (G.J.P. Naylor pers. comm. 2021). High resolution genetic population analyses of two congeners, the Northern River Shark (<em>Glyphis garricki</em>) and Speartooth Shark (<em>Glyphis glyphis</em>) revealed a very high degree of population differentiation over a small geographic scale. There was a significant differentiation of populations separated by just 200 km and these data are consistent with genetically distinct subpopulations in each of the separate areas of their ranges (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020). This may also be the case for the Ganges Shark and it is likely that there are possible subpopulations in each of the separate parts of its known range. Records of the Ganges Shark are sparse and the species is considered extremely rare (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Extensive surveys of sharks and rays have recorded few additional records of this species across its known range, including around the western India, Bay of Bengal, Indo-Malay Archipelago, and the South China Sea. These surveys include: India (e.g., Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Raje <em>et al</em>. 2015, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018), Bangladesh (Haque and Das 2109, S. Chakma pers. comm. 10 November 2018), Thailand (e.g., Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018), Borneo (e.g., Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016), eastern Indonesia (e.g., &gt;21,000 sharks recorded in over six years of surveys but this species not recorded; White 2007), southern China (e.g., Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011), and the Philippines (e.g., Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005). Photographs of a carcharhinid from the Philippines in 2000 ""may possibly be this species"" but were insufficient to confirm the identification (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The historical population size is unknown, but there is little doubt the population has been severely depleted due to a long history of intensive and largely unregulated riverine and coastal fisheries and other threats in its habitat (Compagno and Cook 1995). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and engine power in the Indo-Pacific region and there has been increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to growing coastal human population densities and international trade in shark products, including the fin trade (e.g., Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In Pakistan, significant declines in shark catches have been reported for the last 15 years (Khan 2012). While there is limited information available on the Ganges Shark in the Pakistan region, its large size and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that, like many other large carcharhinids in the region, it is likely to have severely declined. There have been no known records from Pakistan since 2005. The last known record for Pakistan was a set of jaws collected from commercial gillnet landings at the Manora Basin in 2005, estimated to be from an individual approximately 275 cm total length (M. Harris pers. comm. 9th June 2017). In 2001–2002, a small number of jaws were also collected from commercial gillnet landings in Karachi, with most from sharks estimated to be approximately 180–200 cm total length. This species is likely to have occurred in similar habitats to the Pondicherry Shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) which was formerly found in the Indus river in the 1950­–1960s and searches for that species, since 1980s, have failed to find it (Kyne et al. 2021, M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). Further, the catch of Pakistani fishing vessels has been extensively monitored at major landing centres since 1987 but neither this species nor the Pondicherry Shark have been recorded (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). Given this level of search effort, records of Ganges Shark would be expected to have appeared and been recorded if present, and it is possibly recently locally extinct in Pakistan.<br/><br/>In India, landing site surveys have failed to record this species (e.g., Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Raje <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is only one recent record in west Indian waters (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018), indicating (like elsewhere in its range), that the Ganges Shark is extremely rare. Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks, including small-bodied and relatively resilient whaler sharks, such as Spadenose Shark (<em>Scoliodon laticaudus</em>), Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>), and 'blacktip' sharks (<em>Carcharhinus </em>spp.), are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016), likely as a result of dramatic increases in fishing pressure. Across India, landings of elasmobranchs have declined by 44% from 1998–2018 (CMFRI 1999, 2019; Gupta <em>et al</em>. 2020). There have been steep declines in sharks and rays that are captured in trawl and gillnet fisheries. For example, the Milk Shark is a small resilient shark yet the overall stock biomass was estimated to have reduced by 55% of unexploited levels based on a stock assessment of this species from landings during 2012–2014 in Gujarat, India (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, reconstructed elasmobranch landings data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000–2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 then declined to 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Surveys of Bangladeshi fisheries and markets in 2016–2017 identified three records of the Ganges Shark; one from a landing site and two from fins at shark processing centres; a possible few more specimens were present: however, they need further identification (Haque and Das 2019, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). The tidal river systems of the Sundarbans and the coastal waters of Bangladesh provide suitable habitat for the Ganges Shark and there is possibly a population of this species in Bangladesh that has not been detected due to a lack of systematic surveys and species level identifications (Haque and Das 2019). Communications with local scientists and surveys of local fishers have revealed that there has been a significant decline in carcharhinid catch and size over the last 5–10 years in Bangladesh (A. B. Haque pers. comm. 15 October 2020). In 2010–2016 there were 7–8 trawlers that were targeting larger sharks (carcharhinids) but with a decline in catch, these vessels have been forced to target other species. <br/><br/>In Myanmar, there have been no recent records of this species and recent landings surveys in nearby Thailand have failed to record this species (e.g., Arunrugstichai et al. 2018). In Malaysian Borneo, this species was originally described from 15 specimens, with all but one collected from the Kinabatangan River. Most specimens were collected during 1996–1997 surveys with the remainder of the specimens collected in 1999 and 2003 (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160; Recent targeted surveys designed to detect this species and sawfishes in the known area of occurrence in the Kinabatangan River in Borneo failed to document any individuals (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Sixteen sites were sampled (using rod and line, longline, and gillnets) along the Kinabatangan River from 18–23 September 2015. During this survey two individual elasmobranchs were captured; a Giant Freshwater Stingray (<em>Urogymnus polylepis</em>) and a Bull Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>). The authors document that, ""fishermen report that catches of Ganges Shark are very rare (rarer than Giant Freshwater Stingray), and are reportedly caught more often in the dry season"" (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Further fieldwork on 20–24 August 2016 resulted in three additional captures of Giant Freshwater Stingray. Further sporadic field work in Northeast Borneo (Pitas District, within the Kudat-Banggi Priority Conservation Area) resulted in an unverified record of a river shark from Bengkoka River, based on interview with a local fisher (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Further work in the Pitas District rivers estuaries and nearshore areas in March, April, and May 2016 revealed only captures of rays and brief surveys of local fishers and fish markets failed to reveal any Ganges Sharks (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). The reports of local fishers suggest that the Ganges Shark may still persist in the Kinabatangan River (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016); however, without any confirmed recent identifications, it is possible that the Ganges Shark has recently become locally extinct in Sabah, Borneo. It is also possible that the species has become locally extinct in Myanmar.<br/><br/>The Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) formerly occurred in rivers in eastern Borneo, with the last record confirmed from the Kinabatangan River in 1996 (Manjaji-Matsumoto et al. 2016). There have been no verified sightings of sawfishes (Pristidae spp.) from either the Kinabatangan River or rivers in the Kudat-Banggi Priority Conservation Area, yet they were formerly present there (Manjaji 2002). While the sawfishes are potentially more sensitive to fishing mortality and more readily captured due to their toothed rostra than the Ganges Shark, the local extinction of Largetooth Sawfish and Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata) from Malaysia gives an indication of the high levels of fishing mortality in rivers in Borneo, and Southeast Asia more generally (Yan <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>Overall, based on historic and ongoing intensive and largely unregulated riverine and coastal fisheries in its habitat and no refuge from fishing pressure, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of&#160; &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (54 years). It is possibly locally extinct in Pakistan, Myanmar, and Borneo with the limited recent records only from west and east India and Bangladesh. In addition, given the rarity of contemporary records, it is estimated that the number of mature individuals of the Ganges Shark is very small (&lt;250) with small numbers (&lt;50) of mature adults in each subpopulation and an inferred continuing decline due to ongoing intensive and unmanaged fishing pressure and habitat threats across its entire range. The species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd; C2a(i).",Decreasing,"The Ganges Shark has a patchy distribution across the Indo-West Pacific (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is difficult to ascertain its historical distribution. In Pakistan, there are several records from fishers and jaw traders in the Karachi, Sindh Province of Pakistan (mostly from 2001 to 2005) that are likely from south of Karachi and lower Indus River and the adjacent inshore coast (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is no suitable habitat for the species west of the Indus River (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). There is a single record of an adult landed in Mumbai in 2016 on the west coast of India, although it is unlikely to have been caught locally (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is known from the lower Ganges River Basin, West Bengal, India with most historic records from the Hooghly River, and east to at least the Bangladesh-Myanmar border (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2017, Haque and Das 2019). In Myanmar, it is known from a single 19th century specimen collected in the Yangon River (originally described as <em>Carcharhinus siamensis</em>) (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Sabah, Borneo, the species is known from 14 specimens collected from the Kinabatangan River in 1996–2003 (described as <em>Glyphis fowlerae</em>) and it was previously recorded from Borneo around the turn of the 20th century (Compagno 1984, Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2010, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Indonesia, a set of jaws obtained in Cirebon, Java, were identified as Ganges Shark (Li <em>et al</em>. 2015). Due to a lack of local suitable habitat, and Cirebon’s position as a major trading node of fish products, it is likely that this specimen originated elsewhere.","The species is used for its meat, fins, and skin (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). In Bangladesh, fins of the Ganges Shark were identified at shark processing centres (Haque and Das 2019). <em>Glyphis </em>spp. fins have been reported in international trade in Hong Kong and China (Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020a, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020b).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In India, the Ganges Shark is one of 10 species of chondrichthyans protected under Schedule I, Part II A of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (Government of India Ministry of Environment and Forests 2006). However, the effectiveness of this measure is unknown, with ongoing issues in enforcement and compliance. In Bangladesh, the Ganges Shark has been protected since 2012 under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act, 2012, however the effectiveness of this measure is limited due to a general lack of awareness of the protection among fishers and traders (Haque and Das 2019). The species could benefit from some protection in the Sundarbans World Heritage Area, if regulations are enforced. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

The species is known from only a limited number of specimens, and little is known of its ecology and habitat. It is caught as bycatch in small-scale and commercial trawl, gillnet, longline, and trap fisheries and is retained for its meat and fins that are consumed locally. There are no species-specific population trend data, but coastal shark landings in the Philippines have declined by 72% over 1986–2006 despite increasing effort, which is equivalent to a 78% decline over three generation lengths (24 years) of this species. There are no species-specific conservation measures in place, and  despite introduction of measures to limit fishing effort in coastal  waters, intensive fishing continues within its range. Few specimens of this species have been documented despite  ongoing monitoring of landing sites. It is subject to  historic and recent high levels of exploitation and has no  refuge from fishing pressure across its highly restricted spatial and depth range. It is suspected that the Whitefin Topeshark has undergone a population reduction of&#160; &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Whitefin Topeshark occurs in coastal inshore waters from the surface to a depth of 48 m (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 96 cm total length (TL) and size-at-maturity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is viviparous, and a single gravid female was reported with 12 pups with a size-at-birth is 20–22 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Little else is known of its biology.&#160;As there is no information on this species' age at maturity and maximum age, generation length was inferred as 8 years based on size-scaled data for the slightly larger Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Tanaka <em>et al. </em>1978).","The Whitefin Topeshark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range in the Philippines. It is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>The fishing fleet rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Inshore demersal stocks are considered over-exploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species' inshore depth range means it is also susceptible due to habitat degradation and loss of mangrove forest and seagrass areas.<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><p></p><p></p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span>","The Whitefin Topeshark is known from only a limited number of specimens. Its occurrence in the coastal waters of the Philippines down to a depth of 48 m means that it has been exposed to high levels of fishing pressure over a long period of time. There is no species-specific population trend information, but the trend in aggregate shark landings indicate that overall shark populations have been declining. The landings of all combined shark species from municipal and commercial fisheries decreased by 72% over 21 years from 1986 to 2006. The annual landings rose from 4,900 t in 1976 to a peak of 9,800 t in 1986, then declined steadily to 2,770 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This decline in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014). This is equivalent to a 78 % decline when scaled to three generation lengths (24 years) of the Whitefin Tope Shark. Given that few specimens of this species have been documented despite ongoing monitoring of landing sites (NFRDI 2017), that it is subject to historic and recent high levels of exploitation and that it has no refuge from fishing pressure across its spatial or depth range, it is suspected that the population&#160;of Whitefin Topeshark has declined by more than 80% over the past three generation lengths (25 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,The Whitefin Topeshark occurs in the Western Central Pacific Ocean throughout the Philippines (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013).,"The Whitefin Topeshark is used for its flesh and fins, which are consumed locally (J.

In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). In 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on ""muro ami"" gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). In the Philippines, there are &gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapuscua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbatah Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray et al. 2018).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

124407121,39367,Carcharhinus borneensis,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2021,2020-10-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Borneo Shark (<em>Carcharhinus borneensis</em>) is a small (to 70 cm total length) requiem shark known from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and a single ‘doubtful’ specimen collected from Chu San Island in the Chekiang Province of China. The range of this species was possibly more widespread in the 1800s, and it is now much more restricted to off northwestern Borneo. This species was historically known only from five specimens, the last of which was collected in 1937 and the species was presumed extinct until recently rediscovered in 2004 with numerous specimens collected from Mukah, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Like other small requiem sharks, it was probably found in shallow inshore coastal waters less than 50 m deep, and hence is unlikely to have any depth refuge from fisheries. This species is known only from specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, and it is likely to have been fished throughout both its known and plausible range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s. Landings data of all carcharhinid sharks combined from the Indonesia and Malaysia Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the IChina EEZs indicate populations reductions of 36–82% over the past three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. These have been directed searches for this species and there are a number of routine landings surveys throughout the region that would likely have recorded this species. It is now very rare throughout its likely historic range and has only recently been recorded only from Mukah, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Overall, the Borneo Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and actual or potential fishing levels, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","The Borneo Shark's habitat and depth range is unknown as it has only been collected from fish markets. Habitat can be inferred from other members of the <em>Carcharhinus porosus </em>subgroup which are generally found in coastal shelf waters, for example the Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>) inhabits muddy inshore areas and estuaries to a depth of 84 m and it is suspected that the depth range of the Borneo Shark is from the surface to a depth of 50 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann<em> et al. </em>2016). Maximum size is probably small at ~70 cm total length (TL), males mature at 59–62 cm TL, females mature at 61–65 cm TL, and size-at-birth is 24–28 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Borneo Shark can be inferred as having a low productivity, from its close relative the Smalltail Shark which has a litter size of 2–9 pups (litters of 6 pups are known in the Borneo Shark), a gestation length of ~1 year and a biennial reproductive cycle (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 1999, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Smalltail Shark has a low maximum population growth rate for its small body size due to its low fecundity and biennial reproductive rate with an <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.183 ± 0.13–0.24 (95% confidence interval), which is similar to Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">,</em> <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.188) and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna</em>, <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.18) (Pardo <em>et al. </em>2016). Generation length can be inferred from the Smalltail Shark which matures at 6 years of age and has a maximum age of 12 years, and thus is estimated to have a generation length of 9 years (Lessa and Santana 1998, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020).","Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets. <br/><br/>Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth et al. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by demersal trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2, 251 vessels in 1950 to 7, 650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and currently still is, a rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated in the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak had more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reporting to FAO for sharks and rays comprises ~3% of global catch at 23,808 t per year through 2000–2010. Purse seine and gillnets contribute to the majority of the landings. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT.<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009).","Intensive fisheries began more than a century ago in the South China Sea region (Butcher 1996), which is one of the most heavily fished and poorly-monitored regions in the world (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016, Hilborn <em>et al</em>. 2020). Throughout Indonesia, reconstructed carcharhinid catches increased throughout the mid- to late-1900s. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before collapsing by ~325% in the mid-1990s to 11,500 t, where catch has remained relatively stable since (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000–17,500 t until 2004. Thereafter, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600–14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) portion of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t= per year despite continually increasing effort.<br/><br/>Fishermen have reported decreased catches and smaller sizes of sharks in Indonesia, which is strongly indicative of overfishing. Decreases were reported in more recent years of commonly caught species (Whitetip Reef Shark (<em>Trianaedon obesus</em>), Snaggletooth Shark (<em>Hemipristis</em> <em>elongata</em>), Silvertip Shark (<em>C. albimarginatus</em>), Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>C. melanopterus</em>), Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Grey Reef Shark (<em>C. amblyrhynchos</em>), and Bull Shark <em>C. leucas</em>) and decreases starting 20 years ago in other species (Hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.), Wedgefishes (<em>Rhyncobatus </em>spp.), and Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>) with no species having increased in abundance over the past two decades (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), reconstructed carcharhinid landings showed a 66% decline from a peak of 7,400 t in 1997 to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s, then sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t then decreased to 4–5,000 t throughout the 1980s, before increasing to the peak 1997 catch and then steeply declining in the mid-2000s. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines can be used to infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Sarawak. This equates to a population reduction of 82% over three generation lengths (27 years).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Borneo Shark (27 years) they represent a population reduction of 36% and 82% in Indonesia and Sarawak, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Sarawak is the main currently known main area of distribution of this species and hence, the Borneo Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths due to actual or potential fishing levels and a decline in habitat quality and meets the criteria for Critically Endangered A2cd.",Decreasing,"The Borneo Shark is known from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and a single specimen collected from Chu San Island in the Chekiang Province of China in the Western Central Pacific (White <em style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">et al. </em>2010).

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 70 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Bowmouth Guitarfish has litter sizes of 2-11 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Bowmouth Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. While some parts of Australasia provide refuge from intense fishing effort, this proportion of the species’ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. It is inferred that the Bowmouth Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Bowmouth Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 70 m on the continental shelf (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It&#160;occurs on or close to the seabed, mainly over sandy or muddy substrates, and also around coral reefs. Very little is known about the life history characteristics of this species. Maximum size is 270 cm total length (TL); males mature at 150–175 cm TL; females at ~180 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 2–11 pups and a size at birth of 46–48 cm TL&#160;(Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).&#160;Fishing pressure is however considerably lower across northern Australia.<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g., as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g., Oman (19,000 artisanal boats), Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Tanzania (Cripps&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Barrowclift&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Bowmouth Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Pakistan, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is considerably lower across northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea, which provides some refuge for this species. The degree of connectivity with Indonesia and elsewhere is however unknown, and if animals regularly move into Indonesian waters they would face significantly higher levels of fishing pressure there. There are no target fisheries for this species in Australia, but it is taken as bycatch in numerous non-target fisheries (e.g., Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2002). The introduction of Turtle Exclusion Devices in northern and eastern Australian prawn trawl fisheries is likely to have significantly reduced this species' mortality in trawl fishing gear (Brewer <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><br/>Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur in some parts of the range, for example by foreign and regional trawlers in Somalia and Yemen, with wedgefish specifically targeted off East Africa (IOTC 2005, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In northern Australia, wedgefish account for a minor component of the IUU fishing. The IUU activity peaked in the mid-2000s, and although vessel numbers have declined since then, there is still some illegal fishing in the region (Field&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Marshall 2011, Harward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous <em>et al.</em> 1998, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al. </em>2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish' or 'guitarfishes') from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus australiae</em>), Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>R. djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98-99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj <em>et al. </em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and '<em>R. djiddensis'</em>, and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for the Bowmouth Guitarfish, with a decline of 86% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish (<em>R. cooki</em>), Eyebrow Wedgefish (<em>R. palpebratus</em>), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Bowmouth Guitarfish (45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Additionally,&#160;anecdotal reports suggest that artisanal longline fishing in southern Mozambique&#160;led to declines in the Bowmouth Guitarfish as this species was abundant on reefs before longline fisheries began in the early 2000s and subsequently are only seen in low numbers&#160;(Pierce&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><br/>The one region in which the Bowmouth Guitarfish may be in a better state than most of their range is Australia, where fishing effort is relatively low, Turtle Exclusion Devices reduce catches of large rays by 94% (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), and there are controls on their catch and retention. Estimates of fishing mortality rates in the Northern Prawn Fishery (the main fishery to interact with this species) for this, and similar species, are well below those that would lead to significant population declines (Zhou and Griffiths 2008).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and the above information can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Australia, Papua New Guinea, and New Caledonia provide some refuge for the species, however, this proportion of the species’ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. Overall, it is inferred that the Bowmouth Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.&#160;</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Bowmouth Guitarfish is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa through the Western Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, Southeast Asia, and extending north to Japan, south to Australia (where it is wide-ranging across the north of the continent), and east to New Caledonia (Last and Stevens 2009, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The exception for this species is Australia where wedgefishes are generally not utilized or traded.&#160;</a>While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore 2017, Jabado 2018).

Jabado unpubl. data).</p>",Marine,"<p>There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for wedgefishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue.<br/><br/>Kuwait bans the catches of all rays, and all sharks and rays are protected in Israel (although both countries represent a very small part of the species' range). Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, Israel, and Australia. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS. The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed b<span lang=""EN-US"">y a bag limit of one/species/person/day&#160;(maximum of 10 total individuals per day)&#160;for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes the Bowmouth Guitarfish (although enforcement is an ongoing issue). In Australia, Queensland has a recreational possession limit of one shark or ray, and the Northern Territory a possession limit of three. <br/><br/>In the major prawn trawl fisheries of northern and eastern Australia, the bycatch of large elasmobranchs has been significantly reduced since 2000 with the use of Turtle Exclusion Devices in trawl nets (e.g., Brewer&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Northern Territory and Western Australia there are prohibitions on retention of any shark product in several non-target shark fisheries.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management. &#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 60 m. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Smoothnose Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Smoothnose Wedgefish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Smoothnose Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Smoothnose Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Smoothnose Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). It is inferred that the Smoothnose Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.",The Smoothnose Wedgefish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 60 m on the continental shelf and has a preference for shallow bays and river mouths (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Maximum size is thought to be &gt;200 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~130 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Life history is unknown but wedgefishes are lecithotrophic viviparous with small litter sizes.&#160;Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).,"<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Smoothnose Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). For example, in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g., as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Oman (19,000 artisanal boats), Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), and Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018).&#160;The Smoothnose Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g., Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically India, Taiwan, Pakistan, Japan, Sri Lanka, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018).

The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis&#160;</em>was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.

For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. The historic accounts, and one of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Smoothnose Wedgefish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly (additionally, the currently-recognized disjunct distribution of the Smoothnose Wedgefish suggests that it may/may have occurred more widely in the Indo-West Pacific).<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979).

It is worth noting that recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea recorded only a single individual <em>Rhynchobatus </em>(Tirtadanu <em>et al</em>. 2018), and in the North Natuna Sea (which is north of the Java Sea), trawl surveys recorded only two individuals (Yusup <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish', 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia.

Overall, it is inferred that the Smoothnose Wedgefish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Smoothnose Wedgefish is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific; it was first described from India and has been widely confused with the Western Indian Ocean <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em> across its range from the Arabian Sea to the Western Pacific. It was previously thought to occur in East Africa, throughout Southeast Asia, and across northern Australia (as shown in Last and Stevens 2009), but it is now considered to occur in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean, and off China and Japan in the Western Pacific (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). The species' distribution may not be fully defined due to confusion with other members of the&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;species-complex.<p></p>","<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value</a><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">&#160;(e.g., Jabado 2018).

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e. removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, and Iran. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed.

It inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries, all of which are intense and largely unmanaged across much of its range. Although it has always been rare, records have become increasingly so over the decades since the 1950s; it is thought to be locally extinct in the Gulf of California and is overfished further south. There were nine records from all of Mexico between 1978 and 1994 and there have been none since. The situation is somewhat different in Colombia, where the species persists and is caught relatively frequently in artisanal catches. Fishing pressure is high there and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction, although not as severe as that seen in Mexico. Overall, due to the known sensitivity of hammerhead sharks to overfishing, degradation of mangrove habitats, the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, and the lack of recent records in Mexico (a large proportion of its range) despite fisheries-dependent and -independent surveys, it is inferred that the Scalloped Bonnethead has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (24 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered

Scalloped Bonnethead inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth (Weigmann 2016).

Generation length is suspected to be about 8 years, based on available data for the larger (150 cm TL) congeneric Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum recorded age of 18 years (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014).","The Scalloped Bonnethead is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines  and gillnets, and may  also be caught in trawl fisheries.

The species was reportedly abundant in the 1970s, and was still common in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Very few records have been reported in the last 10–15 years, and no sightings are reported from extensive shallow reef  underwater visual census surveys in Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar. Heavy and increasing artisanal fishing pressure exists across the species' range. It is caught as a target species in some areas and as bycatch in a wide variety of gears. The species has no refuge from fishing, and its coral reef habitat is threatened by degradation and loss. It is suspected that the Shorttail Nurse Shark has undergone a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations (estimated at 30 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and actual and potential levels of exploitation. Therefore, this species is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","The Shorttail Nurse Shark inhabits coral reefs in shallow coastal waters, although its full depth range is not known (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). This species reaches a maximum size of 75 cm total length (TL); females mature at 55 cm TL, and males at 59 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is oviparous and can live for &gt;30 years in captivity, but nothing else is known of its life history (Compagno 2001, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). This species is estimated to have a generation length of ~10 years based on information available for the closely-related but much larger (to 300 cm TL) Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>), which has a generation length of 30 years (Carrier and Luer 1990).","The Shorttail Nurse Shark is captured as targeted and non-targeted catch in fisheries and is also affected by habitat degradation and loss. This species is susceptible to capture in a wide variety of artisanal and industrial fishing gears, including ringnets, gillnets, handlines, traps, longlines, and trawls. It is also targeted with spearguns by artisanal fishers. Additionally, the Shorttail Nurse Shark is susceptible to coral reef habitat degradation and loss due to climate change, coral mining, and dynamite fishing (Katikiro and Mahenge 2016). Dynamite fishing is prevalent along the entire Tanzanian coastline (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2015), and the practice has been recorded in Madagascar (David <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Although formerly abundant in the region, this species is now considered rare and very few records have been reported in the past 10–15 years.<br/><br/>In Kenya, this species was still common in the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s, however, a year-long gillnet survey in 2015–2016 did not record any individuals, indicating local depletion (M. Samoilys, unpubl. data, 2018). Generally, subsistence and artisanal fisheries in and around coral reef ecosystems are intensive throughout this region, including Kenya, for example, fishers’ perceptions of historical trends in shark catch rates reported dramatic declines of ~85% over 40 years (Samoilys and Kanyange 2008).<br/><br/>This species was apparently abundant in the 1970s in Tanzania (Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975 cited by Compangno 2001). Surveys of fishers in Zanzibar show that most considered shark and ray numbers in general to have decreased on their fishing grounds, concomitant with an increase in the sale value of shark meat (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). Fishing pressure is sufficiently high to have caused local declines in shark and ray populations; consequently, shark fishers in Zanzibar have been forced to fish much further afield, e.g. Pemba, Tanga, Mafia Island, and Malindi in Kenya (Schaeffer 2004). At the time of the previous (2004) Red List Assessment (Nel <em>et al. </em>2004), this species was still relatively common in Tanzanian catches, but it is suspected to have been depleted given the general decreases in shark numbers.<br/><br/>In southwest Madagascar, where heavy and intensifying fishing pressure exists, extensive landings surveys from 2007–2012 did not record any individuals of this species (Humber <em>et al. </em>2017). Only one individual was recorded in 270 hours of baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys (R. Bennett, unpubl. data, 2018).<br/><br/>No sightings are reported from extensive shallow reef (&lt;30 m) underwater visual census surveys in Tanzania, Mozambique, and Madagascar (M. Samoilys, unpubl. data, 2009–2015).<br/><br/>Overall, this species is subjected to heavy subsistence and artisanal fishing pressure across its geographic and depth range. Available data suggest catch declines and local depletion of sharks due to fisheries. This species has very little refuge from fishing effort, and is also subject to habitat loss and degradation. It is therefore suspected that the Shorttail Nurse Shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (30 years) based on a decline in habitat quality and actual and potential levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Shorttail Nurse Shark occurs in the Western Indian Ocean off the coasts of Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar.

There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Duckbill Eagle Ray.<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Duckbill Eagle Ray is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch, particularly in the northern Mediterranean Sea (Başusta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Akyol&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonard and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras <em>et al.</em> 2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, targeted shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2008).&#160;<p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore  trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of  explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized  beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have  contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic  region and which covers most of the species' range (Koranteng 1998,  GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West  African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated  518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern  Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (<span lang=""EN-US"">Gutiérrez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).  This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported,  and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that  illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly  and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The Duckbill Eagle Ray&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">is also captured in recreational&#160;fisheries, mainly off South Africa, and these may pose a threat to this species. In South Africa, although most anglers prefer to return these rays to the water alive (van der Elst 1988), release mortality is unknown and could be substantial due to the angling practices of gaffing and weighing.</span>&#160;However, shoreline fisheries effort has decreased over the last 18 years as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all terrain vehicles on beaches. Trawl fisheries effort here is heavy along the west and south coasts, and was formally heavy along the east coast. However, these fisheries have decreased in effort in over the last decade, and parts of Namibia are remote with very little fishing pressure (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). On the other hand, heavy and unmanaged trawl fishing and artisanal fisheries effort exist in Mozambique which may threaten this species (Jacquet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Benkenstein 2013).</p><p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire&#160;</span>(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Duckbill Eagle Ray that can be used to estimate population reduction.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Ocean regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013, Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018).</p><p>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, this species was not caught in a trawl survey of the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean basin between 1994<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> and 1999 conducted as part of the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) programme (Baino&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). Only two specimens were recorded as part of the MEDITS programme in the western Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands) from 1994<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> to 2015 (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al.</em> 2020). Similarly, Damalas and Vassilopoulou (2011) found none during trawl surveys in the Aegean Sea from 1995<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">–2006. Only one specimen was caught in scientific trawl surveys conducted&#160;in the Adriatic Sea between 1948 and <span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">2005 (Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). However, in recent years others have reported small numbers of this species in the northern Mediterranean Sea, including Puerto de Mazarrón off southeastern Spain (Hernández-Orts&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), the southeast Aegean Sea (Corsini-Foka and Frantzis 2009), the eastern Ionian Sea (Zogaris and Dussling 2010), Iskenderun Bay and Izmir Bay off Turkey (Başusta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Akyol&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017), which suggests that although rare, it still occurs in this region. Indeed, an experimental trawl fishery in the Aegean Sea (Izmir Bay, Turkey) revealed that this species was one of the least prevalent non-commercial species, representing up to 0.17% of the total catch weight during the winter months and 0.046% in the spring and was not recorded in the summer and autumn (Gurbet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). In 2017, one specimen was recorded from pelagic trawls in the Adriatic Sea with a bycatch rate of 0.006 (specimen per days at sea) (ICES-WGEF 2019). Furthermore, capture of pregnant females in the northern Adriatic Sea suggests this species is reproducing in the area (Dulcic&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;</span></span></span></span></p><p>Second, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria, Mauritania, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;</em><em>et al. </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 in 1981–1983 to 0.060 in 2013–2015.</span></p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p><span style="""">Third, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that, with the exception of Mauritanian waters, there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region.&#160;In Mauritania,&#160;this species is still recorded in regular fisheries monitoring surveys undertaken by the&#160;Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin as well as experimental&#160;research&#160;fishing surveys across&#160;territorial waters since 2009 with between 12</span><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">–</span>117 individuals captured each year (although 1,096 animals were recorded in 2018) (M.

In South Africa, between 2010–2012, local catch was estimated at 1–10 t per year with trawl fisheries as the main contributor followed by the KwaZulu Natal bather protection program, and recreational and commercial line fisheries (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species was not reported in catches of the demersal inshore trawl (hake) fisheries between 2003–2006 (Attwood <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the KwaZulu Natal prawn trawl industry on the Thukela Banks, six individuals were recorded in 169 trawls between 1989–1992 and based on the observer recorded catches, the extrapolated average annual catch was 105 (Fennessy 1994). The species was recorded throughout the year and was common during the summer months prior to 1967 in Durban and Richards Bay (Wallace 1967). In the period of 1977–2000, 246 animals were recorded representing 0.1% of the catches by competitive shore anglers along the KwaZulu Natal coast (Pradervand <em>et al.</em> 2007). Between 1981<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">–2001, overall, 798 animals representing 11.31% of total batoid catches and consisting mainly of juveniles were caught in Natal Sharks Board bather protection netting  with 26 occurrences of three or more Duckbill Eagle Rays caught in one or two days (Young 2001). Mean annual catch was 39.9 and mean catch rate was 0.98 (number animals/km net/yr). During the study period there was considerable variation in catch rate (0.47<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">–1.78) and no significant trend was apparent. There was, however, a significant increasing trend in size caught. Mortality levels were moderate (44.2%, mean = 17.65 animals/year) and there was no significant trend in mortality over the time period. The highest catches occurred at Richards Bay, Zinkwazi, and Durban. Overall, it is difficult to determine the impact of Natal Sharks Board nets on the population, but it is likely to be localized, as this species is not exploited anywhere else to a great extent (Young 2001). It is also caught by recreational fishers (shore anglers) but is generally released alive after capture (Van der Elst 1988) and angling catch figures are not available.&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">There are no population trends for this&#160;</span>species in Mozambique, however, fishing pressure is suspected to be intense and unmanaged in the small portion of its range there.</span></p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p><span style="""">Overall, considering these declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously&#160;occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its limited productivity, and noted declines in&#160;eagle rays in general in several parts of its range, it is suspected that the Duckbill Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three&#160;generation lengths (51 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.</span></p></span>",Decreasing,"The Duckbill Eagle Ray is found in the Northeast Atlantic, Eastern Central Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea (but is absent from the Black Sea), Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Ocean (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.&#160;</p>",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species.&#160;Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Duckbill Eagle Ray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean and Black Sea, skate and ray Total Allowable Catches (TAC) were established for parts of the European region in 2009, including International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) sub-areas VIII (Bay of Biscay) and IX (Iberian waters) where this species is known to occur. At present, the TAC for these Divisions is 3,800 t per year for all skates and rays combined (regulations available online at http://faolex.fao.org). In Turkey, fisheries for all species belonging to the family Myliobatidae have been banned since April 2018 (Bilecenoglu 2019).<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure, and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In South Africa, the network of marine protected areas is extensive and some areas may provide refuge for this species. For example, the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area protects 200 km of coastline, runs from the southern Mozambique border southwards, extends offshore to a depth of 400 m, and has been in place for approximately 40 years. Furthermore, the recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day for chondrichthyans, which includes the Duckbill Eagle Ray. Beach seine fishers in the West Cape are not permitted to retain sharks or rays.</p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters&#160;from close inshore to depths of at least 35 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the African Wedgefish has&#160;litter sizes of 2–5 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population reduction has been inferred for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger wedgefish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, the African Wedgefish was considered to be moderately abundant in the 1960s, but it is now only sporadically observed in landing site surveys.&#160;It is inferred that the African Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.",The African Wedgefish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 35 m on the continental shelf (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Maximum size is&#160;~300 cm total length (TL) (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with a small litter size of 2-5 pups; size at birth is 79-85 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).,"<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure in West Africa with a long history of artisanal and industrial fishing. As a result, demersal coastal fisheries resources are considered overexploited in significant areas of the region (e.g., FAO 2018b).<br/><br/>Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Diop and Dossa 2011); the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006), and no doubt occurs more widely. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species (Tous<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1998, Diop and Dossa 2011).<br/><br/>Several countries across the range of the African Wedgefish are significant fishing nations with high levels of fishing pressure on the marine environment (including Mauritania, Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, and Ghana). Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century: in 1950 there were 125 pirogues (small fishing boats), in the 1980s there were &lt;750, in the late 1990s there were &gt;2,500, and in 2005 there was nearly 4,000 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Furthermore, the industrial fleet is significant with 172 vessels (mostly trawlers) licensed to fish in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2015 (ONS 2017). Similarly, the number of artisanal pirogues in Senegal rose from ~5,000 in 1982 to &gt;9,000 in 2003 and 12,699 in 2006, although it has since fallen slightly to 11,889 in 2013 (FAO 2008, ANSD 2016). The industrial feel operating in Senegalese waters included 91 trawlers in 2013 (ANSD 2016).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The African Wedgefish is however the only <em>Rhynchobatus</em> species occurring in the Eastern Atlantic, and is easily separable from the False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) with which it occurs in Mauritania.<br/><br/>While no time-series are available for the African Wedgefish, it is known to have disappeared from a significant part of West Africa (Mauritania to Sierra Leone but apparently with the exception of the Banc d'Arguin National Park; Diop and Dossa 2011). However, the species is now sparsely reported in the Banc d'Arguin National Park with only two individuals recorded in the past decade during fish landing site monitoring (the most recent record being February 2019) (Saïkou Oumar&#160;Kidé, pers. comm. 14/02/19,&#160;Sall Amadou,&#160;pers. comm. 14/02/19).&#160;This species was moderately abundant across its former range in the 1960s but declined thereafter (Bernard Séret, pers. comm., 07/02/19). During Guinean trawl surveys in the 1960s, catch rates were as high as 30-34 kg/hr (William 1968). Recent fish market surveys across the region have either failed to locate it, or found only low numbers of individuals. In The Gambia, annual surveys since 2010 of landing sites that regularly land guitarfishes and other batoids have not recorded the species (Moore 2017). In one artisanal demersal gillnet fishery in Mayumba, Gabon (between 30 to 40 boats), surveys between&#160;February 2013 and October 2015 identified 40 individuals, and surveys between May and October 2018 identified 5 individuals (Godefroy de Bruyne,&#160;pers. comm.,&#160;14/09/18). Observers on board national trawlers off Gabon have not recorded the species in monitoring which commenced in 2015, despite many species of rays being recorded (Emmanuel Chartrain, pers. comm.,&#160;15/02/19). In Port Gentil, Gabon (around 400 boats), where rays are targeted, the African Wedgefish has not been seen during ongoing surveys which commenced in June 2017 (Godefroy de Bruyne,&#160;pers. comm.,&#160;14/09/18).&#160;A 2006 capture by a recreational fishing guide in Guinea-Bissau was reportedly described as 'very, very rare' (Moore 2017). There is a recent photographic record from Sao Tomé Island (Reiner and Wirst 2016).<br/><br/>In the Indo-West Pacific (outside of the range of the African Wedgefish), there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates (non species-specific) which can be used to infer population reduction, and these can be considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly where they are under heavy exploitation (see the Supplementary Information). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p><br/>These historical accounts and datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)&#160;(recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81-99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30-45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018a, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high and increasing across the range of the African Wedgefish (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines as outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific have not occurred in West Africa (in fact the species has reportedly disappeared from a large part of the region and captures are now rare; Diop and Dossa 2011). This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins. It is inferred that the African Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,The African Wedgefish occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).,"<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.&#160;</a>While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018).

124448942,60182,Rhynchobatus springeri,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Broadnose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus springeri</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 213 cm total length) shark-like ray which is endemic to Southeast Asia from Sumatra to the Philippines. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters with records from depths of 16-40 m, and is suspected to be a habitat specialist occupying shallow brackish coastal and estuarine waters. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Broadnose Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Broadnose Wedgefish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Broadnose Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Broadnose Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while most of these datasets are outside the range of the Broadnose Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific).&#160;It is inferred that the Bottlenose Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Broadnose Wedgefish has been recorded at depth of 16-40 m on the continental shelf (Compagno and Last 2010). This species may be a habitat specialist occupying shallow brackish coastal and estuarine waters (Compagno and Last 2010), and likely also occurs at depths shallower than its documented range. Maximum size is at least 213 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~115 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Life history is unknown but wedgefishes are lecithotrophic viviparous with small litter sizes. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the distribution of the Broadnose Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across its range (Pauly and Chuenpagdee 2003, Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996). Fishing pressure is high across the range of the Broadnose Wedgefish, for example Indonesia has ~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters (KKP 2016). Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Broadnose Wedgefish is landed throughout its range (e.g., Last <em>et al.</em> 2010) and the majority of countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;et al.&#160;2016, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010) and&#160;Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Four of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Smoothnose Wedgefish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is worth noting that recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea recorded only a single individual <em>Rhynchobatus </em>(Tirtadanu <em>et al</em>. 2018), and in the North Natuna Sea (which is north of the Java Sea), trawl surveys recorded only two individuals (Yusup <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'whitespotted wedgefish', 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (<em>Rhina ancylostoma</em>), Bottlenose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus australiae</em>), Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>R. djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of the larger rhinid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98–99% population reduction over the last three generations of the larger rhinid species&#160;(45 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of the larger rhinid species&#160;(45 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and '<em>R. djiddensis'</em>, and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for '<em>R. djiddensis</em>'&#160;(i.e. Bottlenose Wedgefish and Smoothnose Wedgefish), with a decline of 87% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish (<em>R. cooki</em>), Eyebrow Wedgefish (<em>R. palpebratus</em>), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Broadnose Wedgefish&#160;(45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while most of these datasets are outside the range of the Broadnose Wedgefish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Broadnose Wedgefish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Broadnose Wedgefish occurs in the Indo-Malay Archipelago in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific including the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo as well as peninsular Thailand and Malaysia, the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines (Compagno and Last 2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, S.

124461599,63129,Mustelus whitneyi,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2020,2019-02-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Humpback Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus whitneyi</em>) is a small (to 118 cm total length) shark found in the Southeast Pacific from Ecuador to Chile, though it is rarely encountered in Chile and most of its distribution is in Peru. It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 16–211 m, but is more common at 70–100 m. Exploitation is heavy throughout its range. In Peru, it is the fourth most captured of all shark species and the most captured coastal demersal species by Peruvian small-scale fisheries. While subject to a minimum landing size rule, catches of this species are effectively unregulated and the true catch is masked in this aggregate product category of 'tollo'. Historically, in Peru, landings of tollo were high for a 24-year period  between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak  of 25,000 t in 1984. Over the period 1990–2004, there was a  substantial drop in landings to an average of 4,806 t, equivalent to  91.6% reduction over three generation lengths. In general, the artisanal fishery effort has increased, with increased demand for this species as a result of human population growth. Fishing effort has been rising rapidly in Peru with a 35% increase in fishers and a 54% increase in vessels between 1995–2005, and Peru has one of the largest gillnet fisheries in the world; hence, the decline in catches is most likely to reflect a reduction in population size. Overall, the combination of very steep declines in tollo   landings in Peru despite increased effort, and the uncertain species  composition of this mixed  category, lead to inference of a  population  reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (30  years). Therefore, the Humpback Smoothhound is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Humpback Smoothhound is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 16–211 m, but is more common at 70–100 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It reaches a maximum size of&#160;118 cm total length (TL) (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2019); females mature at 73 cm TL and males at 68 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous, with 6–18 young per litter (average of 10) and a size at birth of 22 cm TL (Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Generation length is suspected to be about 10 years as this species is intermediate in size in comparison to other <em>Mustelus</em> species, which range from 5.8 years in <em>M. californicus</em> to 18 years in <em>M. mustelus</em> (Goosen and Smale 1997, Yudin and Cailliet 1990).","The Humpback Smoothhound is taken as bycatch of inshore artisanal gillnet fisheries and trawl fisheries&#160;in Santa Rosa (Santa Elena province)&#160;Ecuador (A. Cevallos unpubl. data) and as part of a target gillnet fishery for tollo in Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Ecuador, there are no reported landings, but this species is likely to be landed and sold locally under the same name. Its abundance decreases towards the south, and consequently the Chilean tollo fishery probably catches only Speckled Smoothhound (<em>M. mento</em>), which has a more southern distribution. Thus, the Peruvian fishery constitutes the main threat. Tollo has been heavily fished off Peru for over 30 years. This species is a major component of artisanal gillnet catches comprising 18% of the overall elasmobranch catch (Córdova-Zavaleta<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). Further, this species is incidentally captured and discarded at sea by the Peruvian hake trawl fishery (Céspedes 2013). In general, the artisanal fishery effort has increased with increased demand for this species as a result of human population growth in the region (Alfaro-Shigueto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;In Peru, fishing effort has been rising rapidly with a 35% increase in fishers and a 54% increase in vessels between 1995–2005. Further, Peru has one of the largest gillnet fisheries in the world&#160;(Alfaro-Shigueto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), hence, stable or declining catches are most likely to reflect a reduction in population size.&#160;There is no refuge from fishing at depth for this shark.<br/><br/>This species’ threat is compounded by declines being masked by an aggregate product category. Throughout the region, tollo is a shark meat product category comprised of Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), Speckled Smoothhound (<em>M. mento</em>), Humpback Smoothhound (<em>M. whitneyi</em>) and Spotted Houndshark (<em>Triakis maculata</em>). The composition of this product varies seasonally and geographically, and the key concern is that high demand is buoyed up by the large seasonal landings of Blue Shark. In the months when Blue Shark is less accessible, this product category comprises the less abundant and less productive smoothhounds and houndshark, driving unsustainable pulses of largely unmonitored and unregulated fisheries. The capture and reporting of catches in bulk species categories has repeatedly been shown to mask the decline of the less abundant and less productive species (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Bornatowski <em>et al. </em>2013, Bornatowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Further, seasonal demand is driven by religious holidays. For example, peak consumption of tollo may be associated with Easter in Peru, where there is high demand for 'Bacalao', which was traditionally salted Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>), but is now mainly Blue Shark and smoothhounds. Any of the coastal species are captured and marketed under this aggregate&#160;product category.<br/><br/>Overall, this smoothhound is subject to intense, increasing, and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has very little if any refuge at depth.","There are no population size estimates for the Humpback Smoothhound. It is rare in Ecuador, according to research surveys from 2011—2015, this species was only recorded 18 times (13 times in 2011 and 5 times in 2012) (A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2020). It is regarded as one of the most frequently captured sharks within the Humboldt Current upwelling ecosystem off Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Peru, it is the fourth-most captured of all shark species and the most captured coastal demersal species by small-scale fisheries (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al</em>. 2016). Historically, in Peru, landings of tollo (an aggregate product category) were high for a 24-year period between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak of 25,000 t in 1984 (FAO 2006). Over the period 1990–2004, there was a substantial drop in landings to an average of 4,806 t, equivalent to 91.6% reduction over three generation lengths. The most recent landings data for Peru shows halving in catch reported in the aggregate category within 15 years (1.5 generation lengths). Specifically, there was a continued decline of landings from approximately 200 t to approximately 100 t over the recent period 1997–2012&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>Overall, the combination of very steep declines in tollo  landings in Peru despite increased effort, and the uncertain species composition of this mixed  category, lead to inference of a  population reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (30  years).",Decreasing,"The Humpback Smoothhound&#160;occurs in the Southeast Pacific from Santa Rosa (Santa Elena province) Ecuador (Béarez 1996, Martínez-Ortíz 2009, Martínez-Ortiz and García-Domínguez 2013, A.

In Chile, this species was thought to be distributed down to 42 degrees south (Pequeño 1989) but the most southern records may have been confused with&#160;<em>Mustelus mento</em> (C. Bustamante, pers. obs. 2020). It is now rarely observed in artisanal and industrial fisheries (Bustamante&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).",This shark is utilised and the meat is consumed locally as tollo (Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).,Marine,"Peruvian legal regulation was put into force in 2001, establishing minimum catch sizes of 60 cm TL&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019).&#160;These species are the main commercial sharks caught off Peru. Improved awareness and education regarding these regulations is lacking and this is now a priority, as is adequate enforcement.

124461743,63130,Triakis maculata,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2020,2019-02-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Spotted Houndshark (<em>Triakis maculata</em>) is a medium-sized (to 180 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Southeast Pacific from Peru to northern Chile, including the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador). It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 10–200 m. Exploitation is intense in Peru where it is subject to a minimum landing size rule, however, catches of this species are effectively unregulated and the true catch is masked in the aggregate product category of 'tollo'. Historically, in Peru, landings of tollo were high for a 24-year period  between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak  of 25,000 t in 1984.

Fishing effort has been rising rapidly in Peru, with a 35% increase in fishers and a 54% increase in vessels between 1995–2005. Peru has one of the largest gillnet fisheries in the world, hence, the decline in catches is most likely to reflect a reduction in population size. The contribution of Spotted Houndshark to tollo landings is unknown, however, this is probably the least common of the three species in this mix and it is large and desirable as food. The slow life history compared to other species included in the tollo landings category and the very steep decline in landings lead to concern that the recent low species-specific landings in Peru reflect a steep historic decline. While there may be some refuge in the Galápagos Islands part of its distribution, given the slow life history of this species, high demand, and the strong likelihood that the population decline has already occurred largely unnoticed, it is inferred that the Spotted Houndshark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generations (60 years), and it is therefore assessed Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Spotted Houndshark is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 10–200 m&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016).

A generation length of 20 years is suspected based on data available for the Spotted Gully Shark (<em>Triakis megalopterus</em>), which reaches a maximum size of 171 cm TL, has an age-of-maturity of 15 years, and a longevity of 25 years (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2011).","Spotted Houndshark&#160;is taken in artisanal gill nets and to a lesser extent in trawls.

124461877,63131,Rhinobatos rhinobatos,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2021,2020-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Common Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos rhinobatos</em>) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) guitarfish that occurs in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola. It is demersal on the continental shelf to a depth of 180 m. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally as a dried or dried and smoked product, while the fins likely enter the international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade.<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including the Common Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Central Atlantic by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. In the Mediterranean Sea,&#160;where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing, the Common Guitarfish was historically abundant throughout the western, central, and eastern regions but is now locally extinct from former areas of its range.<br/><br/>Off the Eastern Central Atlantic, large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in these waters. Other guitarfishes and wedgefishes have undergone severe declines (e.g., the Blackchin Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus cemiculus</em>)) and fishing pressure in shallow coastal habitats is unlikely to decrease. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reductions (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths) for larger guitarfish species are likely to be representative of the situation in the Eastern Central Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Common Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades, and severe population reductions have been noted in Mauritania, Senegal, and in other countries. This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries for guitarfishes in many countries.<br/><br/>It is suspected that the Common Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (42 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Common Guitarfish is demersal across sandy, muddy, and shelly habitats, and occurs inshore on the continental shelf to a depth of 180 m (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 162 cm total length (TL), males mature at 56–79 cm TL and females mature at 64–85 cm TL (Capapé&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;Reproduction is&#160;lecithotrophic viviparous with litters of 1–13 pups born after a gestation period of 10–12 months at a size-at-birth of 25–30 cm TL (Enajjar <em>et al.</em> 2008, Last<em> et al. </em>2016). The age at maturity is two to three years and maximum age is at least 24 years; generation length is therefore 14 years&#160;(Ismen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Başusta<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008).","Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure that is unregulated across the majority of their distribution&#160;on their coastal and shelf habitats. Guitarfishes&#160;are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the&#160;Common Guitarfish,&#160;and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the region.<p>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Guitarfish is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch, however, it has largely disappeared from its former range in the&#160;northern regions of the Mediterranean. This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonard and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;</p><p>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (<span lang=""EN-US"">Gutiérrez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).&#160;</p><p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., for rice and salt production) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span>&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</p>","<p>Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). However, there are limited species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to estimate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018).&#160;</p><p>There are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Watson</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2013,&#160;</span>Belhabib<em style="""">&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018).</p><p>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, there has been a marked decline in the abundance of the Common Guitarfish in the western, central, and eastern regions, based on a combination of fishers' knowledge and data from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) programme. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this species was historically common in the western Mediterranean Sea with reports of its daily presence in the Palermo fish market in the 19th century (Doderlain 1884). Furthermore, in the early 20th century, it was considered a typical resident over sandy substrates around the Balearic Islands (De Buen 1935).&#160;By 1990, this species had been reported as extinct from the&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">western, central, and eastern</span>&#160;regions of the Mediterranean (specifically from the coastal waters of Spain, France, and Italy) with the MEDITS experimental trawl surveys (from the Alboran to the Aegean Sea) between 1994–1999 and trawl surveys in the Adriatic Sea between 1948–2005 failing to record any individuals (Relini and Piccinetti 1991, Baino<em> et al. </em>2001, Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Observations from the 1970s and 1980s indicate that the Common Guitarfish was prevalent within North African coast and eastern basin of Mediterranean (Quignard and Capapé 1971, Whitehead&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1984, Echwikhi&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012, Echwikhi&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013). Fishing effort is lower along the North African coast of the Mediterranean and this species is still caught in the Gulf of Gabès, Tunisia, and&#160;is still relatively common in Turkish waters, particularly in the Iskenderun Bay area&#160;where it is landed as bycatch (Başusta&#160;<em>et al. </em>2008, Soldo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Lawson<em> et al.</em> 2020). Furthermore, this species is reported as one of the most common rays landed in Lebanon although fishing pressure has led to a loss of shark and ray diversity in these waters (Lteif 2015, Lteif <em>et al.</em> 2016). In parts of the&#160;North African coast of the Mediterranean, where the Common Guitarfish&#160;has been targeted by artisanal fishers for decades (e.g., Tunisia), landings indicate declines in abundance with catches containing a large proportion of immature individuals (Newell 2016). No species-specific trend data are available, but the reduction in size, and the high levels of exploitation across this region along with targeted guitarfish fisheries suggest a population reduction in this region, which can also be inferred from looking at data available from outside the Atlantic Ocean on population reduction in wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes.</p><p>Second, species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in Mauritanian waters (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (42 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020, Winker&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).

There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em style="""">et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;</p><p>Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">.&#160;Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 in 1981–1983 to 0.060 in 2013–2015.</span></p><p>Fourth, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Common Guitarfish still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic.&#160;In Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea Bissau targeted fisheries for guitarfishes with specialized fishers were developed by the late 1980s to supply fins to&#160;Ghanaian&#160;traders (Walker <em>et al. </em>2005). While species-specific information is not available,&#160;anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was&#160;historically abundant in these countries but that this targeted fishery led to severe declines in the quantities landed and sizes of guitarfishes captured by 1990 (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005, Newell 2016). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004–2006, this species was present in 14.9% of the total catches and contributed 2.8% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). Observers noted that all sharks and guitarfishes had their fins removed before being discarded. More recently, only&#160;134 individuals have been recorded between 2006–2018 in regular fisheries monitoring surveys undertaken by the&#160;Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin while 10,941 individuals of the Blackchin Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus cemiculus</em>) have been recorded over the same period (M. Dia&#160;unpubl. data 2020). In Senegal, this is a commonly recorded species, although large quantities are only seen at trade centers in Casamance and are likely originating from various countries (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Opportunistic landing&#160;surveys around Ouakam indicate that this species' numbers have substantially declined over&#160;the last decade (A. Ba unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Between 2004–2011, this species was still a commonly recorded species in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and&#160;Sierra Leone during landing site surveys&#160;(Diop&#160;and Dossa 2011). And although it is still recorded in landings across these countries, data on guitarfishes (not species-specific and includes the Blackchin Guitarfish and the&#160;Common Guitarfish) from Senegal indicates&#160;that landings peaked in 1997 at 4,218 tonnes but decreased to an estimated 821 tonnes by 2005 (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020) which would represent a population reduction of 90% for the Common Guitarfish over three generation lengths (42 years).&#160;In&#160;The Gambia, this species was not recorded in abundance during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 although single individuals or small numbers were frequently recorded at landing and processing sites in all years (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;There have been no recent records of this species in landing site surveys in Guinea-Bissau (although restricted to&#160;the&#160;Bijagos Archipelago) or Côte d'Ivoire (G.H.L. Leurs and K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). In Nigeria,&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">it is one of the more common guitarfishes landed although catch&#160;information is not available as they are&#160;aggregated with other guitarfish species such as the Blackchin Guitarfis</span>h&#160;(A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 1% of ray landings with seven individuals recorded (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other Rhinopristiformes (Blackchin Guitarfish, Whitepotted Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos albomaculatus</em>), Spineback Guitarfish (<em>R. irvinei</em>), and African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)) represented 1% of rays captured while it was not recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In the Republic of the Congo, there were no records of this species during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019 although other guitarfish with similar catchability (e.g., Blackchin Guitarfish) were recorded (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). In&#160;Cameroon, 15 individuals have been recorded over two years of landing site surveys representing 0.7% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Angola, it was not recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span>&#160;</p><p>Overall, fishing pressure is high and increasing across the West African range of the Common Guitarfish and there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation in the Mediterranean Sea part of its range which is ongoing. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific guitarfishes from several datasets (Kyne <em>et al. </em>2020). This species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, industrial, and illegal fishing coupled with the continued targeted fisheries for guitarfishes in many countries.&#160;It is suspected that the&#160;Common Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80%&#160;over the last three generation lengths&#160;(42 years) based on abundance data and&#160;actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Common Guitarfish is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;It is not present in the Black Sea and has not been recorded from Cape Verde and&#160;São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wirtz<em> et al.</em> 2013, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, G. Porrinos unpubl. data 2020).<br/></p>","<p>The Common Guitarfish is heavily utilized across its range for the meat and fins. The meat of guitarfishes is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the Mediterranean and West Africa as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and regionally exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Fins are dried and appear to mostly be destined to Asian markets through complex regional trade routes (e.g., from Cameroon to Nigeria and then exported to Asia (A. Takoukam pers. comm. 14 July 2020) or from Mauritania to Senegal (Dakar) (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). In the past, guitarfishes were sometimes discarded as bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries but they are now increasingly retained (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"The Common Guitarfish was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 2017, reflecting Parties' commitments to work regionally towards conservation. This species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks (since 2018) and a special suite of 'Concerted Actions' adopted in 2020, which are aimed at facilitating conservation. This species has also been listed in Annex II of the SPA/BD protocol of the Barcelona Convention since 2012, and Parties that have ratified this Protocol are required to provide legal protected status to the species. Furthermore, although countries across the region have legislation concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Common Guitarfish&#160;are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future.&#160;<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In West Africa, a&#160;number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure, and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).</p><p></p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 1–60 m. The species is mainly taken as retained bycatch of industrial and artisanal demersal trawls and gillnets and the meat is consumed locally and fins of larger individuals are possibly traded. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Severe population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well landings declines of all sharks and rays and for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' in Indonesia that indicate inferred population declines of 88–99% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) of the Jimbaran Guitarfish.

Guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat, and only the fins of the largest individuals are generally retained (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Jimbaran Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016). In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including guitarfishes, may be targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The Jimbaran Guitarfish is likely retained and landed across its limited range and Indonesia is ranked the top shark fishing nation globally (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). The shallow, inshore, soft-bottom habitat preferred by this species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In Southeast Asia, there has been an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In the cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased. In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean within the Indonesian EEZ, elasmobranch reconstructed catches increased in the mid-1960s to early-1970s with catches peaking at 955 t before plummeting to less than 200 t until 1995. Catches peaked again in 1998 at 969 t and have since declined to less than 35 t in 2013 and 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). When scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) of the Jimbaran Guitarfish, this indicates a population reduction of 99%. Although these catches include all elasmobranch species, is it suspected to be indicative of the population reduction of the Jimbaran Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005–2015 (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of rhinobatid guitarfishes. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30 years) of the Jimbaran Guitarfish.<br/><br/>This species is found in a small area that is easily accessible to fishers from both Bali and Lombok which are heavily populated areas. Actual levels of exploitation are extremely high across the range of this species; therefore, it is suspected that the Jimbaran Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (30 years) due to actual levels of fishing pressure, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Jimbaran Guitarfish is currently known only from the Eastern Indian Ocean from southern Bali Island, Indonesia (Last et al. 2006, Last et al. 2016) and from Perak Province, western peninsular Malaysia (A.

The specimen recently captured by trawl in Malacca Straits, Perak Province was confirmed as this species and suggests the species has a broader distribution than initially described (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). It has not been recorded on surveys on the southern coast of Java (Famhi unpubl. data 2020).","Guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for their meat, which is of good quality and is consumed fresh locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Guitarfish fins are utilised, however, due to their smaller size their value is lower than the value of fins from Giant Guitarfishes or Wedgefishes, and fins from smaller individuals are generally discarded. The skin may be traded internationally as a luxury leather product to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags) (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Marine,"There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for guitarfishes. Trawls were banned in 1980 in Indonesia, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015 an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both of these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required that may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is suspected that the Whitespotted Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Whitespotted Guitarfish is demersal in shallow coastal waters on the inner continental shelf to a depth of ~132 m (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2008b). It reaches a maximum size of 80 cm total length (TL) with males mature at ~ 46 cm TL and females mature at ~52 cm TL. Reproduction is possibly lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 2–3 pups and a size-at-birth of ~15 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Little else is known of its biology. There is no information on this species's age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Common Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos rhinobatos</em>). The Common Guitarfish has an age-at-maturity of four years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14 years (Başusta <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Whitespotted Guitarfish has a smaller maximum size (80 cm TL) than the Common Guitarfish (162 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 8 years for the Whitespotted Guitarfish.","Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distribution. Guitarfishes&#160;are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, longline, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the&#160;Whitespotted Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the region.<br/><p>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al.</em> 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (<span lang=""EN-US"">Gutiérrez&#160; <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).&#160;</p><p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al. </em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span>&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).<br/></p>","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to estimate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018). Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson<em> et al.</em> 2013, Belhabib<em> et al. </em>2018).<p>Both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria, Mauritania, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;</p><p>Firstly, overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to calculate reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 in 1981–1983 to 0.060 in 2013–2015.</p><p>Secondly, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with steep declines to the point of local disappearance in some places. Although the Whitespotted Guitarfish was never very abundant across the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic, it has become increasingly rare, particularly in landings&#160;(B. Séret pers. comm. 23 August 2020).&#160;There have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the region. In Mauritania, between 2010<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">–2019, only two specimens were recorded in regular fisheries monitoring surveys undertaken by the&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (M.

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of guitarfishes is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Fins are dried and appear to mostly be destined to Asian markets through complex regional trade routes (e.g., from Cameroon to Nigeria and then exported to Asia (A. Takoukam&#160;pers. comm. 14 July 2020)). In the past, guitarfishes were sometimes discarded as bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006) but they are now increasingly retained (M.

It is a taken as a target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears including deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. It is retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and fish meal.<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is targeted for its liver oil in Suruga Bay, Honshu with deep-water gillnets (McCormack and White 2009). It is also taken as bycatch of demersal trawls and retained for the meat and fins. Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara<em> et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21438533""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884015"">Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019a).</a><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010,&#160; Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high and was 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019b). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).</a><br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, the species is not encountered by commercial fishers as it occurs at depths not yet fished (White <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Indonesia, deep-water demersal longlines operate at depths of 150–600 m and capture and retain the Dwarf Gulper Shark (White <em>et al. </em>2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the major threat to the Dwarf Gulper Shark is the rapid expansion of deep-water fisheries off western India, including a targeted&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>fishery that commenced in 2002, and a deep-water shrimp trawl fishery which takes the species as bycatch. The shrimp trawl fishery developed in 1999 and expanded rapidly with trawler numbers peaking soon thereafter in 2000–2001 before dropping significantly, although there are still some 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015). The fishery operates on the Quilon Bank and Wedge Bank areas off southwest India at depths of 200–500 m;&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>species are a major bycatch of this fishery (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011, Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013a, Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b). As marine fish stocks from nearshore waters off India are heavily exploited, it is likely that fisheries will continue to expand into deeper water. There is little information available on deep-water fishing activities around Sri Lanka, although the Dwarf Gulper Sharks is likely captured by local line fishers where there is easy access to deep-water habitat relatively close to shore (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Fernando <em>et al. </em>2019). There is currently no deep-water fishing where the species occurs off Oman. In Somalia in the mid-1970s, there was commercial deep-water trawling and  since then several foreign fishing companies have been given fishing  licenses to fish in the offshore Somalia EEZ (FAO 2008) and illegal and unregulated fishing is ongoing (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017).</p>","Population trend data for the species and for elasmobranchs is available from a number of regions. This species was relatively common in Taiwan in the late 1980s, but by the 2000s was rare and it has not been seen in the past 10 years (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can  be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased  while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. As fishing effort has increased in Taiwan since 2000, the lack of observation of the species infers a &gt;80% reduction in the population of Dwarf Gulper Shark in Taiwan over the past three generations (83 years).<br/><br/>There is no species-specific data from Japan, however, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Across Japan, fishing effort has declined by about one third since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). The reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. This represents a 99% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (83 years) of the Dwarf Gulper Shark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of the Dwarf Gulper Shark in Japan.        <p>  </p><p>Although the Dwarf Gulper Shark is not known from the Maldives, the collapse of the gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.) stock off the Maldives in the early 2000s demonstrates the susceptibility&#160;of the group to overfishing. This collapse was&#160;due to targeted fishing, after only about 20 years of exploitation. Although time-series data are not available for catches or landings, there are figures for shark liver oil exports. These show a peak in 1982 soon after the fishery commenced followed by a general downwards trend until 1989, increases in 1990 and 1991, before a complete crash sometime thereafter as available data shows very low export figures for 1996 onward (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007, Ali 2015). The fishery has ceased and since 2010 there is no shark fishing in the Maldives. The stock of&#160;<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.&#160;is, however, inferred to have declined by &gt;80%. Given the life history of&#160;<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp., recovery is expected to be very slow (Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009).&#160;</p>  Although time-series data are not available from India, the gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp.) stock is suspected to have collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-sea fishing off western India. A targeted&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002 and during the period 2002–2008 there had been a major increase in landings of deep-sea sharks (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013a, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). The fishery slowed after 2009 due to market forces, as well as an apparent decrease in the size of sharks in the fishery (Akhilesh and Ganga 2013).<br/><p>  </p><p>The population reductions in Taiwan and Japan are inferred to be &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (83 years). The Maldives <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. population collapse is similar to the dramatic  reductions in <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. populations that occurred in Australia (Graham<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2001).

Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019).

It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 100 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Halavi Guitarfish has litter sizes of up to 10 pups and an estimated generation length of 10 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all giant guitarfishes in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Halavi Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). Furthermore, rapid declines have been documented in landings of the Halavi Guitarfish in the United Arab Emirates, and while some local trawl bans would likely benefit the species, actual levels of exploitation remain significant across the region.&#160;It is inferred that the&#160;Halavi Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.<p>&#160;</p>","The Halavi Guitarfish occurs from close inshore to depths of at least 100 m on the continental shelf (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Maximum size is 187 cm total length (TL); males and females mature at ~83 cm TL (Moore and Peirce 2013, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of up to 10 pups; size at birth is ~29 cm TL (Gohar and Mazhar 1964).&#160;Generation length is estimated as 10 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India (Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Red Sea for example, the number of traditional boats tripled from 3,100 to 10,000 from 1988 to 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), and in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Oman (19,000 artisanal boats) and Pakistan (2,000 trawlers) (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Halavi Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g. Spaet and Berumen 2015, Henderson <em>et al. </em>2007, Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically India, Pakistan, and Iran (Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (White and Sommerville 2010, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. All of the historical accounts, and two of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Halavi Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).</p><p>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) and Halavi Guitarfish. Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of an 81% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish (<em>G. obtusus</em>). Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 94-95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of an 86% population reduction over the last three generations of the Halavi Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (<em>G. typus</em>) and Clubnose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Landings declined by 86% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Halavi Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Halavi Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Halavi Guitarfish is endemic to the Arabian Sea and its adjacent waters in the Western Indian Ocean, where it occurs in coastal waters of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea from Kenya and Yemen to northern India (Gujarat), including the southern Arabian/Persian Gulf (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, M.

While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W.

Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm), including this species. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, and Israel. This may have reduced the retention of animals solely for their fins, but fins are still traded when whole animals are landed. A Ministerial Decree issued by the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) in 2019 imposes a permanent ban on fishing in UAE waters for shark species listed on CITES, and on CMS.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

Guitarfishes&#160;are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the&#160;<span style="""">Spineback Guitarfish,&#160;</span>and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the region.<br/><p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (<span lang=""EN-US"">Gutiérrez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).&#160;</p><p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays and guitarfishes are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Moore 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span>&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).</p>","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedge fishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to estimate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018). Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013, Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018).<p>Both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria, Mauritania, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;</p><p>Firstly, overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-uni- effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">.&#160;Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to calculate reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 in 1981–1983 to 0.060 in 2013–2015.</p><p>Secondly, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with steep declines to the point of local disappearance in some places.

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of guitarfishes is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Fins are dried and appear to mostly be destined to Asian markets through complex regional trade routes (e.g., from Cameroon to Nigeria and then exported to Asia (A. Takoukam&#160;pers. comm. 14 July 2020)). In the past, guitarfishes were sometimes discarded as bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006) but they are now increasingly retained (M.

Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K.

The western boundary of this species distribution is uncertain due to confusion with the Spotted Guitarfish (<em>R. punctifer</em>). It is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 5–73 m. The species is mainly a bycatch of a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, and gillnets. The meat is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins are exported from Bangladesh to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Severe population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from the UAE, Iran, Pakistan, and India. Landings data of guitarfishes and rays from the UAE, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh indicate landings declines of 69–93% consistent with population reductions of 80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. It is suspected that the Bengal Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Bengal Guitarfish is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 5–73 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 95 cm total length (TL), males mature at 63 cm TL and females mature at 65 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Purushottam <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reproduction is presumably lecithotrophic viviparous and size-at-birth is 20 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016) but relatively little is known of the biology of the species, and it is confused with other species in the Indian Ocean. There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age and hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Common Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos rhinobatos</em>). The Common Guitarfish has an age-at-maturity of four years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14 years (Başusta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Bengal Guitarfish has a smaller maximum size (95 cm TL) than the Common Guitarfish (150 cm TL), therefore generation length was scaled to be 9 years.","Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat, with only the fins of the largest individuals generally retained (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bengal Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et a</em>l. 2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including guitarfishes, may be targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The Bengal Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g. Jabado 2018) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically India, Pakistan, and Iran (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters. In Pakistan, there has been a rapid rise in demersal-set gillnetters with around 7,700 vessels using this gear in Balochistan and Sindh provinces to target demersal fishes including guitarfishes and wedgefishes. There are also 2,500 trawlers targeting demersal fishes and shrimp that take about 5–8% of the annual catch of guitarfishes and wedgefishes (Moazzam and Osmany 2020). There was a rapid rise in the catch of guitarfishes and wedgefishes from around 500 t in 2003–2010 to 6,689 t in 2011 peaking at 7,570t&#160; in 2014 dropping to 1,664 t in 2016 due to a restriction in catch and landings of Rhinopristiformes in 2016 (Moazzam and Osmany 2020). In the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228 as reported in 2010) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010). Sri Lanka had 24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004.<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore, soft-bottom habitat preferred by this species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters, dredging and coastal land reclamation has increased in recent years and has resulted in almost total loss of mangroves in some areas, such as Bahrain (Sheppard <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017), while Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to estimate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, which are acute for the Bengal Guitarfish (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased. In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013). To infer population reduction for Bengal Guitarfish, five contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates are supplemented with a historical narrative from Bangladesh.<br/><br/>First, the Bengal Guitarfish is one of the most commonly landed guitarfish (9.5% of rhinopristoids) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman (Jabado 2018). Without understanding patterns in fishing effort it can be difficult to infer declines from landings data. Nevertheless, assuming constant or increasing fishing effort, landings surveys reveal significant declines of wedgefishes and guitarfishes in the UAE. For example, there has been a rapid decline – despite ongoing fishing effort – of the related Halavi Guitarfish (Glaucostegus halavi); 10–20 individuals were regularly observed during 2010–2012, while landings of 1–2 individuals were more common five years later, consistent with a 90% decline in less than one generation length (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>Second, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997–2016 (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, rhinobatids, and glaucostegids occurring locally, and these trends are also likely to be representative for the Bengal Guitarfish. Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 69% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years) of the Bengal Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Third, landings data for “guitarfish (Rhinopristiformes)” category, including Bengal Guitarfish, are available from Pakistan for 1993–2011 covering the country’s two coastal provinces (Gore <em>et al</em>. 2019, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). There was a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011 in Sindh province and an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011 in Balochistan province (Gore <em>et al</em>. 2019). These decreases are the equivalent of 87–93% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years) of the Bengal Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Fourth, this species was historically abundant along both southeast and west coasts of India. There have been steep declines in elasmobranchs reported from India (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2015) which could be applicable to this species. The catch from historically known areas in the east coast has reduced, yet this species is still the one of most commonly caught guitarfish, along with the Stripenose Guitarfish (<em>Acroteriobatus variegatus</em>), in the southern coasts of India (K.V. Akhilesh unpubl. data 2020). This species still occurs along the east coast with greatest numbers in West Bengal and an average of 5–70 individuals ranging in size from 22 to 72 cm total length (TL) caught in trawl catches (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. 2020). In the west coast, this species constituted 2% of the total biomass of all batoids landed in Maharashtra. The estimated landings of Bengal Guitarfish as bycatch of shrimp trawlers, gillnetters and bag or dol netters varied between 0.1–3.1 t from 2012 to 2016 (Purushottama <em>et al</em>. 2020). The size range in the fishery is 30-95 cm TL, with a mean size of 56 cm TL (Purushottama <em>et al</em>. 2020). Catch data for myliobatid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays but does not include guitarfishes) is available from Maharashtra, on the west coast of India. There, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Although this information is not species-specific, and the actual proportion of the Bengal Guitarfish in the catch in unknown, it provides a good indication of batoid declines in India. This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 85% over the three generation lengths (27 years) of the Bengal Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Fifth, while there are no species-specific data available on this species, elasmobranchs have been heavily exploited in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, southern India (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002). Significant declines in wedgefish and guitarfish landings have been documented in Tamil Nadu through monitoring at Chennai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wedgefish and guitarfish landings decreased by 86% over the five years of monitoring (2002–2006). Trawlers in Tamil Nadu fish widely throughout southern India (Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014) and data can be considered representative of the broader area. The entire Indian range of the species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure, with little refuge.<br/><br/>Sixth, this species is not very commonly landed, but it is observed throughout the year in Bangladesh. Questionnaire surveys of local fishers revealed a steep decline in wedgefishes and guitarfishes in the past ten years, particularly the Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatos </em>spp.) which has not been seen in the past decade (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The Bengal Guitarfish is now regarded as being extremely uncommon (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is high across the range of this species, and while some of these datasets encompass other Rhinopristiformes or may only consider myliobatid rays, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indian Ocean. Overall, it is suspected that the Bengal Guitarfish has undergone declines in catch of &gt;90%, 69%, 87–93% and 85% in the UAE, Iran, Pakistan and India, respectively, which is consistent with&#160; a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Bengal Guitarfish occurs in the northern Indian Ocean from the United Arab Emirates and Iran to Bangladesh, including Sri Lanka (Hoq <em>et al. </em>2011, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The western boundary of this species distribution is uncertain due to confusion with<em> </em>the Spotted Guitarfish (<em>Rhynchobatos punctifer</em>) (A. Moore pers. comm. 8/10/2020).","Guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for their meat which is of good quality and is consumed fresh locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). In Bangladesh, the meat is mostly consumed in tribal areas, but it also exported to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Guitarfish fins are utilised, however, due to their smaller size their value is lower than the value of fins from Giant Guitarfishes or Wedgefishes and fins from smaller individuals are generally discarded. The skin may be traded internationally as a luxury leather product to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags) (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Marine,"There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for guitarfishes. Some localized protections, trawl bans, finning bans, as well as general fisheries management and marine protected areas likely benefit this species, although in some areas, effective enforcement is an ongoing issue. Kuwait bans the catches of all rays. Balochistan province in Pakistan protects all guitarfishes and wedgefishes and therefore this species is specifically protected in that province, while in Sindh province there are protections for juvenile guitarfishes and wedgefishes (less than 30 cm total length), including this species (Moazzam and Osmany 2020). The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively), and other countries have seasonal trawl closures that may benefit the species. Finning (i.e., removing fins and discarding the body at sea) has been banned in several range states including the UAE, Oman, Iran, India, and Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It occurs in coastal and continental shelves inshore at depths from 30 to 80 m. It was formerly targeted along with other skates in gillnet fisheries off southern Korea, but as a result of declining abundance it is now taken mainly as retained bycatch. Given national and international demand for skate this decline is likely to be ongoing. This species is now inferred to be present only in a small proportion (15–20%) of its historic range&#160;in relatively narrow areas of habitat around the Jeju Strait and the southern Heuksan-do Islands (southeastern Korea) and now appears to be rare or locally extinct in the easternmost part of its range. Hence, the Korean Skate is inferred to have undergone a decline in area of occupancy and suspected to have undergone a population reduction of greater than 80% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","The Korean Skate is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–80 m (Jeong and Nakabo 1997). It reaches a maximum size of 84 cm total length (TL), males mature at 60 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous. Generation length is inferred to be 10 years based on a smaller relative, the Sharpspine Skate (<em>Okamejei acutispinna</em>) (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><em><br/></em>","<p>This skate is both a target and utilised bycatch of commercial and artisanal fisheries. Skates are targeted using set gillnets off southern Korea. Declining catches have led to a decrease in target fishing in recent years, but no species-specific data are available, so it is difficult to identify which species are involved.&#160;International demand for skates by Korea is very high, driven by demand for Hongeo or Hongeohoe, fermented skate meat which is a traditional delicacy. To give an indication of the scale of demand for skate, Korea is the major importer of skates from around the world, driving imports from as a far away as Russia, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Europe (Hyun-Su&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). </p>","In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969–2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;In Korea, this species was formerly a target species of commercial fisheries and declining skate catches have led to a decrease in target skate fishing in recent years. Korean skate is still taken as retained bycatch. However, there are no species-specific data are available, so it is difficult to identify which species are involved. Declines in catches of the preferred species, Mottled Skate (<em>Beringraja pulchra</em>) and Ocellate Spot skate (<em>Okamejei kenojei</em>) has led to increased human consumption of Korean Skate (Kim 2005, NFSDI 2005).&#160;The Jeju Strait and the area around the southern Heuksan-do Islands, where this species is more commonly found, appear to be important sites for this species (Jeong 1999). There this species is uncommon, only about 100 individuals were observed during fish market surveys conducted in southern Korea over 15 months (September 2002 to December 2003) (Kim&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). This species is now rare throughout its relatively small geographic range, except in relatively narrow areas of habitat around the Jeju Strait and the southern Heuksan-do Islands (southeastern Korea). In, Japan, this species was historically present in low numbers in Shimayama and Goto Islands (Tokimura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Three to four individuals were caught in two locations there in 1998, but none have been seen since despite continued scientific observation (A. Yamaguchi, unpubl. data 2019). There is concern that it is now more rarely observed than historically, but no quantitative data are currently available on the scale or extent of any decline. This species is now inferred to be abundant in a small fraction (15–20%) of its historic range and now appears to be rare or locally extinct in the eastern most part of its range.

124498408,161516,Gymnura tentaculata,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2021,2020-09-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>The Tentacled Butterfly Ray (<em>Gymnura tentaculata</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 85 cm disc width) poorly-known ray of the northern Indian Ocean, reportedly widespread in the Arabian Sea and its adjacent waters (Red Sea and Persian/Arabian Gulf, hereafter referred to as 'the Gulf') and occurring inshore to 87 m depth. Verified records have, however, only been confirmed from Iran, Pakistan, and India. There is a single historical record from the Bay of Bengal, so it appears the Arabian Sea was the historical centre of its range. The type locality has been reported as the Red Sea, but this is uncertain and has been debated in the literature. Despite field and fish market surveys, the species has not been recorded in India since 1973 and Pakistan in 1986 (where it was regularly observed in landings along the Balochistan coast between 1982 and 1986). It does however persist in Iran where it represented 15% of the ray bycatch of demersal commercial and research trawl vessels operating in the eastern Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman in surveys undertaken between October 2019 and July 2020. It is discarded at-sea with very high bycatch mortality. It is also taken in coastal arrow-head fixed fish traps along the Iranian coast of the Strait of Hormuz (Hormuzgan Province) where it is usually released but is occasionally retained for consumption. Fishing pressure is intense across the former and current range of the species and severe declines have been documented in rays, e.g. one dataset from a landing site in Mumbai, India shows significant declines in ray landings of ~60% over 15 years with increasing fishing effort; this is the equivalent of ~86% decline over a period of three generation lengths (30 years). Given that the Tentacled Butterfly Ray has experienced a significant decline in extent of occurrence with no contemporary records in India and Pakistan (despite good survey coverage), documented severe declines of rays in India, intense fishing pressure across the species' range, and the fact that it is now only found in Iran, it is inferred that the population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generations (30 years), and the Tentacled Butterfly Ray is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.<br/></p><p></p>","<p>The Tentacled Butterfly Ray occurs from close inshore to a depth of 87 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). Very little else is known of the habitat and ecology of this species. Off Iran, minimum and maximum recorded sizes are 14 cm disc width (DW) and 85 cm DW, respectively (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). Male size-at-maturity has been reported as ~40 cm DW (Last et al. 2016); of recent catches observed in Iran, a male of 32 cm DW was subadult while three males of 41–50 cm DW were mature (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). Female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last et al. 2016), although a female of 28 cm DW examined at the Musee National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris was still immature (B. Seret pers. comm. 31/05/2017). Generation length is unknown, but is estimated at 10 years based on age data from the Spiny Butterfly Ray (Gymnura altavela) which has a female age-at-maturity of ~4 years and maximum age of 18 years resulting in a generation length of 11 years (Parsons <em>et al</em>. 2018). This maximum age is for a female of 215 cm DW, which is considerably larger than the known maximum size of the Tentacled Butterfly Ray (85 cm DW), so this is likely to be an overestimate of generation length.<br/></p><p></p><p></p>","Butterfly rays are regularly captured in trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries across the range of this species. The Tentacled Butterfly Ray is a discarded bycatch of demersal commercial trawl vessels in Iran; it represented 15% of the ray bycatch of vessels in the eastern Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman in surveys undertaken between October 2019 and July 2020 (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). Bycatch mortality is high; of individuals assessed before discarding, 98% were dead when returned to the water (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). It is also taken in coastal arrow-head fixed fish traps along the Iranian coast of the Strait of Hormuz (Hormuzgan Province) where it is usually released but is occasionally retained for consumption (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). In Iran, fishing pressure has been increasing, for example the number of fishers went from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab 2006). Recently, the exploitation of rays as target species has sharply increased along Iranian waters of the Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz, driven by a novel illegal ray trade route developed between Iran and Pakistan. The magnitude and effects of these fisheries and trade on the Tentacled Butterfly Ray has not been quantified. <br/><br/>Elsewhere across the region, fishing pressure is intense and increasing. For example, in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers almost doubled from ~6,600 in 2004 to over 11,500 in 2010 (Zynudheen et al. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Similarly, gillnet fishing (including net length) is increasing in India (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 09/02/2017) with over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 14,000 fishing vessels, including about 2,000 shrimp trawlers, operate in shallow coastal and offshore shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 11/11/2018). In the Red Sea, fishing pressure has also been increasing with the number of Saudi Arabian traditional vessels operating having increased from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner et al. 2011) while in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting elasmobranch populations (Glaser <em>et al</em>. 2015). These fishing vessel and effort numbers highlight the intensity of coastal and shelf fisheries across the Northern Indian Ocean, encompassing the former range of the Tentacled Butterfly Ray.<br/><p></p>","There are no records of the Tentacled Butterfly Ray from India or Pakistan since 1973 and 1986, respectively, despite considerable (and increasing) elasmobranch-specific research, survey, and monitoring efforts across its former range. The only contemporary records come from Iran (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). The species is well represented in museum collections by at least 35 specimens (L. Yokota pers. comm. 09/06/2017).<br/><br/>India, where the bulk of historical records of the Tentacled Butterfly Ray originate, has seen extensive landing site monitoring in recent years (e.g. Raje et al. 2007, Raje and Zacharia 2009, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2018), yet there are no contemporary records available for this species. Butterfly Rays have been a common bycatch of commercial fishing operations, particularly trawling (Muktha <em>et al</em>. 2018), a fishing method to which they are particularly susceptible given their benthic habitat, and slow swimming speeds. Populations of butterfly rays are suspected to have declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in rays from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990 and 2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This is the equivalent of a ~86% decline over a period of three generation length (30 years) for the Tentacled Butterfly Ray. Although this information is not species-specific, it provides an indication of overall ray declines as a result of heavy (and increasing) fishing pressure on the continental shelf of India (and likely reflects the situation in Pakistan). Raje and Zacharia (2009) also report an increase in butterfly ray landings in Mumbai from 1990 to 1992 to a peak in 1999–2001 with a drastic drop in 2002–04. Although marginally outside of the historical range of the species, it is worth noting that monitoring in Bangladesh that has been recording landings of Gymnura species, have not recorded the Tentacled Butterfly Ray (A. Bintha Haque pers. comm. 10/11/2018).<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the last collected specimens are from 1978 (held in the Los Angeles County Museum vertebrate collection). The Tentacled Butterfly Ray was regularly observed in landings along the Balochistan coast between 1982 and 1986 but monitoring and surveys have not encountered any specimens in the last 30 years, despite actively searching for the species (M. Khan pers. comm. 09/06/2017).<br/><br/>In Iran, the Tentacled Butterfly Ray represented 15% of the ray bycatch of demersal commercial and research trawl vessels operating in the eastern Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman in surveys undertaken between October 2019 and July 2020 (M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020). Other surveys of rays from landing sites and during trawl observer programs in Iran (e.g. Vossoughi and Vosoughi 1999, Owfi <em>et al</em>. 2016) failed to record this species, although the Longtail Butterfly Ray was present in catches.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the Gulf, recent surveys have not recorded the Tentacled Butterfly Ray, supporting the notion that it is restricted to Iranian waters. Landing site and field surveys which have recorded the Longtail Butterfly Ray (<em>Gymnura poecilura</em>), generally in low numbers, have not recorded any Tentacled Butterfly Rays, for example in Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013), and the UAE (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data). It was also not recorded during extensive landing site surveys in Oman (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/><br/>In the Red Sea, the species has not been recorded from surveys and monitoring in various countries such as Saudi Arabia and Sudan (Bonfil 2003, Spaet and Berumen 2015, I. Elhassan pers. comm. 09/02/2017). <br/><br/>Given that the Tentacled Butterfly Ray is no longer recorded in India and Pakistan (despite good survey coverage), documented severe declines in rays in India, intense fishing pressure across the species' range, and the fact that it is now only found in Iran (inferring a significant decline in extent of occurrence), it is inferred that the population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generations (30 years).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Tentacled Butterfly Ray was reported as widespread in the Northern Indian Ocean (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). The type locality was given only as the 'Indian Ocean', but Müller and Henle (1841) specified that specimens were obtained from the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. The collector, Polydore Roux, visited the Red Sea in 1831–1832, and it is assumed the type specimens were collected then. However, he also visited India in 1836 leading to speculation that the specimens were actually collected in India (i.e., Golani and Bogorodsky (2010) stating that the species does not occur in the Red Sea). The species has been recorded with certainty from Iran, Pakistan, and India. Most Indian records are from the west coast, with the only specimen from outside the Arabian Sea being from Odisha in the Bay of Bengal (L. Yokota pers. comm. 09/05/2017). A sighting record from Snoopy Island, United Arab Emirates in April 2014 and reported on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF Secretariat 2017) cannot be verified and in fact is likely to be the Longtail Butterfly Ray (Gymnura poecilura) which is common around this popular dive site (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2018). The known contemporary range is restricted to Iran (eastern Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, Gulf of Oman, encompassing the coast from the border between Hormozgan and Bushehr Provinces to the Iran/Pakistan border; M. Rezaie-Atagholipour unpubl. data 2020) and the species is inferred to have undergone a significant decline in extent of occurrence.","In India and Pakistan, this species would presumably have been sold for local consumption of meat at fish markets across its former range.

Coastal industrial shrimp trawling commenced in the 1950s with eight small fishing boats (D’Croz <em>et al.</em> 1979) and currently there are around 190 licensed vessels in the industrial fleet off Panama, using beam trawls targeting shrimp (FAO 2018). Due to high fishing pressure in the zone, the shrimp landings have decreased in recent decades (CGR 2019). Within the Gulf of Panama there are fisheries for small pelagic fishes (anchovies, herrings etc.) that operate on soft-benthic coastal habitats and catch several species of ray as bycatch, including Rogers’ Round Ray (<em>Urotrygon rogersi</em>) (CeDePesca 2016). This indicates that the Reticulate Round Ray would also be susceptible to capture in these fisheries. A variety of small-scale fisheries also operate within the Gulf of Panama with little management (~1,500 registered artisanal vessels in the Province of Panama alone; ARAP 2015). There are no recent records of the species, and given its shallow depth range, it likely has little refuge from fishing.</p>","There are no population size or trend estimates, however the Reticulate Round Ray is considered to be a rare species.&#160;During 2019, a concerted effort was made to search for new records of this species through engagement with fishers, fisheries observers, and seafood markets, but no records or information on its contemporary occurrence could be ascertained (J.M. Morales-Saldaña unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Biological data from tropical Eastern Pacific round rays show&#160;life history parameters,&#160;including&#160;very early ages-at-maturity (1–4 years;&#160;Mejía-Falla&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Guzmán-Castellanos 2015,&#160;Torres-Palacios&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), that demonstrate high biological productivity and therefore resilience to fishing mortality.<br/><br/>Due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its entire known range and a lack of recent records, it is inferred that the Reticulate Round Ray&#160;has undergone a population reduction of more than 80% over the last three generations (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Reticulate Round Ray occurs in the Eastern Central Pacific where it has a restricted distribution in the Gulf of Panama (Miyake and McEachran 1988, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence is estimated to be ~25,300 km².","Round rays are of little commercial value due to their small size. They are often discarded when caught, although there may be some retention in small-scale (artisanal) fisheries for meat, fish meal, or bait.",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this species. Although some marine protected areas exist in the Gulf of Panama (e.g. The Special Management Zone of the Archipiélago de Las Perlas), surveillance and enforcement are a challenge. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, and bycatch mitigation, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement. Further research is needed to define its contemporary occurrence (and identity any remnant populations),&#160;population size and trend, and life history. Both small- and large-scale fisheries should be monitored for bycatch at the species level.</p>","",,false,false,Global

The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal trawl and net fisheries, as well as recreational fisheries in South Africa, and is retained for human consumption or discarded. It is suspected to have limited biological productivity similar to other myliobatid rays (including a low fecundity of 3–7 pups per litter), limiting its capacity to sustain fishing pressure. This species often swims in groups and this&#160;schooling behaviour exposes it to a high likelihood of large quantities being captured by trawl and gillnets in one haul.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species.&#160;In the northwest Mediterranean Sea, data from landings and trawl surveys showed that catches declined in the 1970s, and the species disappeared from catches and landings altogether from the 1980s to 1995. Despite its former presence, it has not been documented from trawl surveys in the&#160;western, central, and eastern&#160;Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Central Atlantic, and very few records are available from its remaining range across the Eastern Central Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean despite ongoing artisanal fisheries monitoring projects. In South Africa, the Common Eagle Ray is estimated to be decreasing but stable and this is likely the only portion of its range where&#160;pressure is not as high. Overall, considering these declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where is previously&#160;occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its aggregating behaviour, its limited productivity, and noted declines in&#160;eagle rays in general in several parts of its range, it is suspected that the Common Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three&#160;generation lengths (36 years) based on abundance data&#160;and actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","<span style="""">The Common Eagle Ray is demersal and semi-pelagic in shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf and offshore to&#160;a&#160;depth of&#160;537 m and often swims in groups (</span>Whitehead&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984<span style="""">,&#160;Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW) with males mature at ~32–40 cm DW and females mature at ~43–60 cm DW (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a gestation period of 6–8 months, litter sizes of 3–7 pups, and size-at-birth at ~19 cm DW (Whitehead&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984,&#160;Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

The&#160;Bat Eagle Ray&#160;has an age-at-maturity of five years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14.5 years (Martin and Caillet 1988). The&#160;Common Eagle Ray&#160;has a smaller maximum size (150 cm DW) than the Bat Eagle Ray (180 cm DW), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 12 years for the Common Eagle Ray.</span><span lang=""EN-US"">","<span lang=""EN-US""><span style="""">The Common Eagle Ray is&#160;taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set net, tangle net, and trammel net, and is retained for human consumption. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Common Eagle Ray and t</span>he schooling behaviour of this species means that large numbers could be fished out in one haul and&#160;fishers off West Africa are known to target aggregations of rays (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).<span style=""""><br/></span><br/><span style="""">In the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Eagle Ray is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch, particularly in the northern Mediterranean Sea (Gurbet<em> et al.</em> 2013).&#160;This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonard and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, target shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries by artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style=""""><br/>In South Africa, <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">between 2010–2012, local catch was estimated at 1–10 t per  year with trawl fisheries as the main contributor followed by the  KwaZulu Natal bather protection program, and recreational and commercial  line fisheries (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The annual average  catch estimates of this species in the demersal inshore trawl (hake)  fisheries between 2003–2006 was 26 t with most of the catch discarded  and no information on survival rates (Attwood&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).  Based on an estimated individual mass of 10 kg, this catch would amount  to 2,600 individuals per annum (G. Cliff unpubl. data 2020). In the  KwaZulu Natal prawn trawl industry on the Thukela Banks, four  individuals were recorded in 169 trawls between 1989–1992 and based on  the observer recorded catches, the extrapolated average annual catch was  50 (range 38–71) (Fennessy 1994). <br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In the  period of 1977–2000, 20 animals were recorded (&lt;1 per year) by  competitive shore anglers along the KwaZulu Natal coast (Pradervand&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;Overall,  it&#160;is commonly caught by recreational fishers (shore anglers) but is  generally released alive after capture (Brouwer <em>et al. </em>1997)&#160;and  the species is specifically targeted during shore angling competitions  (Pradervand and Govender 2003, Pradervand 2004, Pradervand&#160;2007), but  most are released. Adults and juveniles are caught as a bycatch in the  beach seine fishery targeting mullet in the Western Cape (Lamberth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994, Lamberth 2006). It was present in 35% of hauls, with 4.9 individuals taken per haul (Lambert 2006). </span></span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (</span>Gutiérrez <span style=""""><em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).  This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported,  and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that  illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly  and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span lang=""EN-US""><p><span style="""">The Common Eagle Ray is also captured in recreational&#160;fisheries, mainly off South Africa, and these may pose a threat to this species. In South Africa, although most anglers prefer to return these rays to the water alive (van der Elst 1988), release mortality is unknown and could be substantial due to the angling practices of gaffing and weighing. However, shoreline fisheries effort has decreased over the last 18 years as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all terrain vehicles on beaches. Trawl fisheries effort here is heavy along the west and south coasts, and was formally heavy along the east coast. However, these fisheries have decreased in effort in over the last decade, and parts of Namibia are remote with very little fishing pressure (Smale 2006, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). On the other hand, heavy and unmanaged trawl fishing and artisanal fisheries effort exist in Mozambique which may threaten this species (Jacquet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Benkenstein 2013).</span></p><p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Côte d'Ivoire</span><span style="""">&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span></p></span>","<p><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Species-specific  population trend data are available from relative abundance from South Africa (Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of  Agriculture,&#160;Forestry&#160;and Fisheries, unpubl. data 2020).

This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over  three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN  Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the  Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates from&#160;demersal trawl surveys conducted during autumn and spring  along the South Africa south coast (1991–2019) revealed an annual rate of decrease  of 0.48%, consistent with an estimated 11.1% decrease and the highest probability of being Least Concern over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;</p><p><span style="""">Also in South Africa, <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">between 1978 and 2017, 136 animals were  caught in Natal Sharks Board net installations with a 69% released rate  (Young 2001, KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board pers. comm. 25 August 2020).

Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, and Western Indian Ocean regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013).</span></p><p><span style="""">First,&#160;tre</span>nds in both commercial landings in the demersal fishery (mostly trawl) from 1970–1995&#160;and data from a bottom trawl survey from 1957–1995&#160;from the Gulf of Lions, France, northwest Mediterranean Sea from 1970–1995 showed a clear decrease in catches during the study period. This decrease led to a total absence of the Common Eagle Ray from catches and landings after the late 1970s (Aldebert 1997). Results obtained from experimental surveys confirmed that decreasing trends were most likely related to the continuous increasing fishing intensity, resulting in a general decline in stocks and not changing patterns of effort in the fishery. &#160;The International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) collected catch data from 1994–1999 at depths of 10–800 m alo<span style="""">ng&#160;the entire western, central, and eastern Mediterranean basin.</span> This species was captured in 37 of 6,336 scientific survey hauls conducted during this period (Baino&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).

The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch per unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<a>This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased</a></span><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style="""">. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">&#160;et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.&#160;</em>2020).

In West Africa, it is heavily utilized for its meat. While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.<br/><p><br/></p>",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species.&#160;Although countries across its range have legislation concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Common Eagle Ray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean and Black Sea, skate and ray Total Allowable Catches (TAC) were established for parts of the European region in 2009, including International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) sub-areas VIII (Bay of Biscay) and IX (Iberian waters) where this species is known to occur. At present, the TAC for these Divisions is 3,800 t per year for all skates and rays combined (regulations available online at http://faolex.fao.org).&#160;In 2013, in the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and North Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES sub-areas VI−IX) the TAC for all skate and ray species grouped was 21,800 t.&#160;In Turkey, fisheries for all species belonging to the family Myliobatidae have been banned since April 2018 (Bilecenoglu 2019).<br/><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In South Africa, the network of marine protected areas is extensive and some areas may provide refuge for this species. For example, the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area protects 200 km of coastline, runs from the southern Mozambique border southwards, extends offshore to a depth of 400 m, and has been in place for approximately 40 years. Furthermore, the recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day for chondrichthyans. Beach seine fishers in the West Cape are not permitted to retain sharks or rays.<br/></p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It occurs on the continental slope at depths of 100–500 m, and mostly at depths of 200–300 m. The species is caught as incidental catch in intensive deep-water trawl fisheries operating across its entire known spatial and depth range.&#160;The species&#160;has a fairly restricted distribution and&#160;no refuge from fishing pressure. Swellsharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines.

These fisheries operate at depths between 200–700 m, offering the species little to no refuge from fishing pressure. There are an estimated 500 vessels operating in the fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data, 2019). Observer reports show less than 62 specimens have been landed annually in Kollum, Kerala over the past five years, and there are additional reports of the species being retained for fish meal at the end of fishing trips (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data, 2019). In the Andaman Sea, there are currently only two demersal trawlers in operation, however, this is likely to increase in the near future with interest in fisheries development around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data, 2019). <br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, targeted deep-water shark fishing dates back to the 1980s, and current fishing effort is relatively small (R.M.K. Bown unpubl. data 2019). However, interest in developing local liver oil processing facilities to improve product value will likely increase regional fishing effort (D. Fernando pers. comm. 21/03/20), and thus, increase fishing pressure on deep-water species, including the&#160;Indian Swellshark.","There are no species-specific time series for the&#160;Indian Swellshark. Swellsharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines.

The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally salted-dried or dried and smoked. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species.<br/><br/>Very few records are available from across its range despite ongoing artisanal fisheries monitoring projects (although many are recent and do not cover the whole range of the species), however, confusion with other dasyatid species occurring in the region is likely. There is a lack of species-specific reporting, taxonomic and identification issues, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear. <br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, however, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area.

It is also likely taken in industrial fisheries operating trawls in coastal areas.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore et al. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares et al. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Smalltooth Stingray that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that in recent decades there have been limited records of this species from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. However, it is important to note that this could be due to taxonomic uncertainty and confusion with other species of dasyatids that occur in the region. This species was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of large rays were recorded (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, six individuals were recently recorded in opportunistic surveys in Mauritania's Parc National du Banc D'Arguin (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, only three individuals were recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was detected in water samples and confirmed from market surveys were it was sold fresh for local consumption (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, two individuals were recorded from surveys of local markets in São Tomé and Príncipe (G. Porriños unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, three individuals were recorded over two years of landing site surveys (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Gabon, a handful of specimens resembling this species have been recorded in artisanal fisheries operating demersal set gillnets in Mayumba, but confirmation is required (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). However, this species has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research trawl surveys, and in Western Ghana during landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, despite other species of rays with similar catchability being recorded in significant quantities (P. Doherty, K. Metcalfe, I. Seidu, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There is a lack of species-specific reporting, taxonomic and identification issues, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, research trawl survey data from several countries in the region indicate that catch rates of other large rays have shown declines of at least 90%. This can be used to infer declines in several dasyatid species given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same gear. Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, however, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Smalltooth Stingray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">",Decreasing,"The Smalltooth Stingray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic from Mauritania to Cameroon, including São Tomé and Príncipe (Last et al. 2016b, Moore et al. 2019, Petean <em>et al</em>. 2020; R.W. Jabado, G. Porriños, A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). It is known from a small number of fragmented records and is likely to have been historically confused with other dasyatid species occurring in the region.","The Smalltooth Stingray is utilized for its meat. While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso.",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Smalltooth Stingray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global
124526883,161677,Rhinobatos lionotus,Critically Endangered,A2d,2021,2019-05-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Smoothback Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos lionotus</em>) is a small (to 85 cm total length) guitarfish that occurs in the northern Indian Ocean from India to Myanmar, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It is demersal on the inner continental shelf down to a depth of 73 m. The species is mainly a bycatch of a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawls, longlines, and gillnets. The meat is consumed locally and traded internationally, fins of larger individuals are possibly traded, and the skins from larger individuals are exported from Bangladesh to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Severe population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets mainly from India. Landings data of rays from Mumbai, west India, guitarfish landings from Chennai in east India, and shark landings in Sri Lanka infer landings declines of 82–83% consistent with population reductions of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. It is suspected that the Smoothback Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Smoothback Guitarfish is demersal on the inner continental shelf to 73 m depth (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 85 cm total length (TL) (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2018), males mature at 40 cm TL and females mature at 48 cm TL (Sen and Dash 2020). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, with litter sizes of 2–7 pups and size-at-birth ~15 cm (Sen and Dash 2020). Relatively little else is known of the biology of the species, and it is confused with other species in the Indian Ocean. There is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age and hence, generation length was inferred based on data for Common Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos rhinobatos</em>). The Common Guitarfish has an age-at-maturity of four years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 19 years (Başusta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Smoothback Guitarfish has a smaller maximum size (85 cm TL) than the Common Guitarfish (162 cm TL), therefore generation length was scaled to be 8 years.","Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat, and only the fins of the largest individuals are retained (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Smoothback Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228 as reported in 2010) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including guitarfishes, may be targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The Smoothback Guitarfish is landed throughout its range and India ranks the 3rd top shark fishing nations globally (Oakes and Sant 2019). There is a large amount of IUU in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki et al. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In Southeast Asia, there has been an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018). <br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased. In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013). To infer population reduction for Smoothback Guitarfish, four contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates are supplemented with a historical narrative from Bangladesh.<br/><br/>First, this species was historically abundant along both east and west coasts of India. On the west coast, the population declined by more than 90% and surveys of fisheries landing sites have not recorded any individuals since 2008 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. 2020). Catch data for myliobatid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays but does not include guitarfishes) is available from Maharashtra, on the west coast of India. There, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Although this information is not species-specific, and the actual proportion of the Smoothback Guitarfish in the catch is unknown, it provides a good indication of batoid declines in India. This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 82% over the three generation lengths (24 years) of the Smoothback Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Second, while there are no species-specific data available on this species, elasmobranchs have been heavily exploited in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, southern India (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002). Significant declines in wedgefish and guitarfish landings have been documented in Tamil Nadu through monitoring at Chennai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wedgefish and guitarfish landings decreased by 86% over the five years of monitoring (2002–2006). Trawlers in Tamil Nadu fish widely throughout southern India (Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014) and data can be considered representative of the broader area. The entire Indian range of the species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure, with little refuge.<br/><br/>Third, this species still occurs along the east Indian coast with greatest numbers in West Bengal to Tamil Nadu and is stated as common in the fisheries (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2018). In West Bengal, Smoothback Guitarfish and Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) account for 43% and 57% of guitarfish landings, respectively. There, 91% of the estimated landings of the Smoothback Guitarfish were from trawlers and 9% from gillnetters (Sen and Dash 2020). Overall, total elasmobranch catch has been declining since 2016 with a 12.6% decline between 2017 and 2018 (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Fourth, in Sri Lanka, Smoothback Guitarfish is captured occasionally in the north using demersal longlines and in the south and west with demersal-set gillnets (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Shark catches have decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 83% over the three generation lengths (24 years) of the Smoothback Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Fifth, this species is not very commonly landed throughout the year in Bangladesh. Questionnaire surveys of local fishers revealed a steep decline in wedgefishes and guitarfishes in the past 10 years, particularly the Whitespotted Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus spp.) which has not been seen in the past decade (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The Smoothback Guitarfish is regarded as being extremely uncommon (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is high across the range of this species, and while some of these datasets encompass other Rhinopristiformes or may only consider myliobatid rays, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indian Ocean. Overall, it is suspected that the Smoothback Guitarfish has undergone declines in catch of 82% and 83% in India and Sri Lanka equivalent to a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (24 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.",Decreasing,"The Smoothback Guitarfish occurs in the northern Indian Ocean from India to Myanmar, including Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Last et al. 2016, K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data. 2019, D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).","Guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for their meat which is of good quality and is consumed fresh locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). In West Bengal, they are traded to other regions where there is a demand for elasmobranch meat (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Bangladesh, the meat is mostly consumed in tribal areas, but it also exported to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Guitarfish fins are utilised, however, due to their smaller size their value is lower than the value of fins from Giant Guitarfishes or Wedgefishes, and fins from smaller individuals are generally discarded. The skin may be traded internationally as a luxury leather product to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags) (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><p></p>",Marine,"There are no known measures in place for this species. Research is urgently required on its full range, habitat, biology and interactions with fisheries.&#160;To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

130105307,61334,Bahaba taipingensis,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-10-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This coastal and estuarine species has a relatively limited distribution in China from the Yangtze River estuary to the Pearl River estuary.&#160;From the 1930s to the late 1990s, it was heavily targeted by fisheries throughout its range, especially where it formed large, seasonal spawning aggregations in the mouths of four major estuaries. A variety of intrinsic characteristics (e.g., large-bodied, aggregate spawning behaviour and predictable occurrence) make it particularly susceptible to overfishing.&#160;Population data are limited, but catch declines documented in the Pearl River estuary and some similar evidence from elsewhere in its range, indicate it declined by over 90% from the 1930s to the 2000s. Spawning aggregations were greatly reduced or were no longer observed by the 2000s.&#160;It is inferred to remain at a very low level near extinction to the current day. Although the species was designated for protection by the Chinese government in 1989, illegal fishing has continued as the value of its swimbladder in the traditional medicine market remains very high. It is not protected in Hong Kong. In addition, estuaries in this region have experienced degradation, and this has likely impacted the nursery and spawning habitat of this species. Continuous declines of more than 90% have been observed since the 1930s. Over the three-generation length time period (51 years), this species declined in Hong Kong from 10 t in the 1950-60s to near zero by 1997 representing a 96% decline, and was declared commercially extinct. Near Dongguan, landings declined from 210 t in the 1950-60s to 2.5 t in the 2000s, yielding a decline of over 99% over three generations. Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered A2bcd. Research is needed on life history as well as the remaining population. Conservation measures are needed to improve fisheries management.","This is one of the largest sciaenid species. It attains lengths up to 200 cm and can exceed 100 kg in weight (Lin 1939, Chu <em>et al</em>. 1963, Anderson 1972, Trewavas 1977). It inhabits nearshore, coastal areas and estuaries and spawns by forming large annual aggregations in April in the mouths of major estuaries. It&#160;feeds on fishes, shrimps, crabs and other crustaceans (Lu and Ye 2002, Sadovy and Cheung 2003). Sexual maturation occurs at about 13 kg and 35-40 cm total length (Chu <em>et al</em>. 1963, Wu 1991). Life history information is limited for this species. A similarly large-bodied, slow-growing sciaenid species,&#160;<em>Totoaba macdonaldi</em>, is applied as a proxy to estimate generation length. The totoaba has an estimated generation length of about 17 years based on its age at first maturity of 7 years and maximum age of 27 years and applying the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","The primary major threat to this species is overfishing, but impacts from degradation of estuarine habitats is also likely significant (Zao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;Its intrinsic biological characteristics of large size, limited geographic range and aggregating behaviour often involving sound production that makes individuals particularly easy to find, contributes to its susceptibility to rapid declines under heavy fishing pressure (Sadovy and Cheung 2003).","This species experienced declines from the 1930s to the 2000s to near extinction due to overfishing. Across its distribution, spawning aggregations formed and were targeted in four major estuaries: the Yangtze River estuary near Shanghai, the Qiantang River estuary in Zhejiang Province near Zhoushan Island, the Min River estuary in Fujian Province and the Pearl River estuary near Taiping and Hong Kong. Bottom trawling has also impacted juveniles both through direct mortality and degradation of nursery habitats in estuarine areas (Sadovy and Cheung 2003).&#160;The fishery was not monitored, and data are sparse for much of its range; however, declines documented for the Pearl River estuary are inferred to be similar in the three other estuaries based on some available catch data and known similarly high levels of fishing intensity. Based on its intrinsic susceptibility to overexploitation and&#160;continued insufficient fisheries management and degradation of essential estuarine habitat (Sadovy and Cheung 2003), it is inferred the population of this species continuously declined by over 90% since the 1930s, including over the past three generation length time period estimated as 51 years, and will continue to remain at a very low level.&#160;<br/><br/>Annual Hong Kong landings were about 50 t in the late 1930s, but then declined by 80% to about 10 t in the 1950s and 1960s (Sadovy and Cheung 2003).&#160;Landings in the 1950s to 1960s were significantly higher (about 180 to 210 t)&#160;further upstream from Hong Kong&#160;in the Pearl River estuary near Dongguan&#160;(Lu and Ye 2002).&#160;By the 1950s and 1960s, Hong Kong catch was composed of relatively small individuals with some rare large individuals. Landings data are not available for the 1980s, but by the 1990s, only small fish were taken sporadically, and large individuals increased in rarity. A trawl survey conducted in 1981-1982 in Dongguan&#160;reported that this species represented 9% of the total weight of the catch, and 0.7% in terms of abundance. Small individuals dominated this catch with total lengths ranging from 5.5 to 61.7 cm and a mean of 18.7 cm. In recognition of these declines, the species was designated by the Chinese government for protective measures intended to reduce fishing in 1989; however, fishing effort remained high through the 1990s due to high demand and increasing market value. Hong Kong catch continued to decline to near zero, and in 1997, it was considered commercially extinct&#160;(Lin 1939, Chu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1963, Pitcher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Sadovy and Cheung 2003). Based on a survey of illegal fishing and trading conducted in Dongguan, catch of this species was about 2.5 t in the 2000s. As of the early 2000s, it was suspected that spawning continued at some level around Xiqiyang, Dongguan. Due to the high value of a single fish, fishing continues even though population numbers are very low (Lu and Ye 2002).&#160;<br/><br/>Elsewhere in mainland China, a similar pattern of decline was noted after the 1960s. Annual catch in the 1950s and 1960s in Zhejiang Province was 5-6 t. Early catch data for the Min River are not available, but 80 large fish per year was not uncommon.&#160;Prior to the 1980s, total PRC (mainland China) landings (excluding Hong Kong) did not exceed 10-20 t annually&#160;(Hui 1987, Wu 2001,&#160;Sadovy and Cheung 2003). Spawning aggregations are no longer observed, and given the heavy fishing pressure and fast economic development in the region, there are likely to be few or no refuges remaining for recovery.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to China. It occurs in shallow, coastal waters from the Yangtze River southwards to Hong Kong (Chu <em>et al</em>. 1963, Fowler 1972, Trevwavas 1977, Cheng 1989, Wu 1991).","This species is targeted by local commercial fisheries throughout its range. Its swimbladder is highly-valued in the traditional medicine market. The value of its swimbladder increased from a few US$ per kg in the late 1930s to 20,000-64,000 US$ per kg in 2000-2001, when it significantly exceeded the value of gold (Lin 1939, Chu and Wu 1985, Sadovy and Cheung 2003).",Marine,"This species has been listed as a Grade II State Protected Species in the Peoples Republic of China since 1989. Despite this designation, which is intended to reduce fishing, it is still caught and sold illegally (Lu and Ye 2002). It was listed as Endangered in 2004 in the China Species Red List Book (Wang and Xie 2009). The government began to develop a breeding program over a decade ago, but attempts to grow-out juveniles to maturity remain unsuccessful. In 2005, the Chinese government designated a protected area in the Pearl River estuary intended to provide some protection specifically for this species. It remains unprotected in Hong Kong.

Habitat and depth range are unknown, but it likely occurs on the sandy shoals, mudflats, and seagrass beds of the Banc d’Arguin. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the False Shark Ray is unknown, but generation length is estimated as 15 years.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk522539384"">The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)</a>&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in its waters. The Indigenous Imraguen population in the north of the country where the False Shark Ray occurs were traditionally subsistence fishers until a shift to commercial shark fishing from the mid-1980s.&#160;This shift, along with increasing artisanal and industrial fishing effort possibly depleted the False Shark Ray population even before it was formally described in 2016. The False Shark Ray occurs in an area where directly targeting shark has been prohibited since 2003 and where only traditional Indigenous fishers are permitted to fish (the Banc d'Arguin National Park). However, the artisanal fishing effort in the National Park, combined with illegal fishing effort is considerable, and the False Shark Ray is known to be landed locally. Individuals have been observed with their fins removed when landed, and the fins sold to local fin dealers. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger wedgefish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, the False Shark Ray is not likely to have any refuge from fishing within its very restricted range&#160;given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins. While the species meets Endangered B1ab(v) (due to an EOO of &lt;5,000 km², its presence in only one location, and an inferred continuing decline in the number of mature individuals due to this ongoing fishing pressure), it is inferred that the False Shark Ray&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The False Shark Ray likely occurs on the sandy shoals, mudflats, and seagrass beds of the Banc d’Arguin, but depth range is unknown. Maximum size is 275 cm total length (TL) (Séret and Naylor 2016). Life history is unknown but wedgefishes are lecithotrophic viviparous with small litter sizes. Generation length is estimated as 15 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions.

There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure in West Africa with a long history of artisanal and industrial fishing. As a result, demersal coastal fisheries resources are considered overexploited in significant areas of the region (e.g., FAO 2018b).<br/><br/>Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Diop and Dossa 2011); the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species (Tous<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1998, Diop and Dossa 2011).<br/><br/>Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century: in 1950 there were 125 pirogues (small fishing boats), in the 1980s there were &lt;750, in the late 1990s there were &gt;2,500, and in 2005 there was nearly 4,000 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Furthermore, the industrial fleet is significant with 172 vessels (mostly trawlers) licensed to fish in its Exclusive Economic Zone in 2015 (ONS 2017). Unreported finning of sharks and 'guitar sharks' occurs in the Mauritania industrial shrimp fishery (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). The Indigenous Imraguen population in the north of the country were traditionally subsistence fishers until a shift to commercial shark fishing from the mid-1980s (see Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). This shift, along with increasing artisanal and industrial fishing effort possibly depleted the False Shark Ray population even before it was formally described by Séret and Naylor (2016).<br/><br/>The False Shark Ray occurs in an area where directly targeting shark has been prohibited since 2003 (Diop and Dossa 2011) and where only traditional Indigenous fishers are permitted to fish (the Banc d'Arguin National Park). However, the artisanal fishing effort in the National Park, combined with illegal fishing effort is considerable (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), and the False Shark Ray is known to be landed locally (Séret and Naylor 2016). Individuals have been observed with their fins removed when landed, and the fins sold to local fin dealers (Séret and Naylor 2016).&#160;Despite the ban on targeted shark fishing and its occurrence in a National Park where only Indigenous fishers are permitted to operate, the False Shark Ray is not likely to have any refuge from fishing given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins.</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e., <em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The False Shark Ray is however a unique species, but the first specimen was only collected in 1998 and it was formally described only in 2016 (Séret and Naylor 2016), restricting the amount of available information.<br/><br/>While no time-series are available for the False Shark Ray in the Eastern Atlantic, the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) has disappeared from across a large part of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011). This species was moderately abundant across its former range in the 1960s but declined thereafter and is now rarely encountered (Bernard Séret, pers. comm., 07/02/19).<br/><br/>In the Indo-West Pacific (outside of the range of the False Shark Ray), there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates (non species-specific) which can be used to infer population reduction, and these can be considered informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly where they are under heavy exploitation (see the Supplementary Information). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/><br/>These historical accounts and datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979); (2) the collapse of Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002); (3) the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes) in in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009); (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are the equivalent of 81–99% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30–45 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018a, M. Gore unpubl. data) (see the Supplementary Information); and, (5) significant declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' (which includes wedgefishes) in Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays (which does not include wedgefishes, but is representative of declines in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra (63% decline for a 15-year period) in India (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009) (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high and increasing across the limited range of the False Shark Ray (see Threats section), and there is nothing to suspect that similar declines as outlined above for the Indo-West Pacific have not occurred in Mauritania. Indeed, this species is not likely to have any refuge from fishing within its very restricted range&#160;given the combined effort from subsistence, artisanal, and illegal fishing coupled with the high value of its fins. It is inferred that the False Shark Ray&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The False Shark Ray is currently only known from a single location, the Banc d’Arguin of Mauritania in the Eastern Central Atlantic (Séret and Naylor 2016). The species is very poorly-known and its full range is not defined, although current records suggest that it is likely to be very range restricted (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Based on collection records (Séret and Naylor 2016), its extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be &lt;1,500 km².","<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value&#160;(e.g. Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data). The restricted distribution and rarity of the False Shark Ray likely restricts it regularly entering international trade in contrast to other species, however, the species is salted and dried for local consumption, and the fins sold to local fin dealers (Séret and Naylor 2016).</p>",Marine,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">The False Shark Ray is protected as part of a ban on directly targeted shark fishing in the Banc d'Arguin, Mauritania, which was implemented in December 2003 (Diop and Dossa 2011).

Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.&#160;Given the very restricted range of the species, a priority is to accurately define its distribution and habitat to assist in spatial management.&#160;</span></p>","",,false,false,Global

In parts of Japan, this species has not been seen for 20 years and where it has been reported over the past 40 years, catches are rare. In the Republic of Korea, it is extremely rare with only three individuals reported since 2014 and dramatic population declines are suspected due to intense fishing pressure for skates. In Taiwan, it has not been observed for 20 years.

The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka </a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">). Demand for seafood in Japan, and Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5 kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019a). </a><a name=""_Hlk22884500""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884500""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">Although the high demand may lead to an increase in imports, it is assumed that it is also leads to ongoing pressure on domestic fisheries which in turn leads to ongoing threats to the Japanese Angleshark.</a></p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (</a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014</a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">).</a><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">  </a></p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22884500""></a></p>The Yellow Sea was once one of the most intensively exploited Large  Marine Ecosystems in the world and is considered severely impacted  in terms of overfishing, with destructive fishing practices (NOAA  2009). In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 (~2,000% increase) in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019c<strong>, </strong>Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019c, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (~350<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>500% increase) (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<a name=""_Hlk21696013""> </a>Small individuals of the Japanese Angelshark that are not used for human consumption would be used for fish meal.</p>  Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include dramatic habitat loss in the region. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). This may impact the inshore component of the species range.","The Japanese Angelshark is now rare throughout its range. In  Russian waters of the Japan Sea, this species is extremely rare,  possibly because it is the northernmost limit of its range (I. Volvenko  and Y. Dyldin pers. comm. 29/08/2019). Across Japan, the population trend of the Japanese Angelshark has dramatically decreased. In Ariake Bay (southwest Japan), fishermen used  to catch this angelshark but they have not seen it in the past  20 years. In Suruga Bay (southeast Japan), it is rare with only 200 individuals captured over the past 40 years during set  net surveys at 50 m depth (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In South Korea, it is extremely rare and may have undergone dramatic population reductions due to intense fishing pressure of the skate fisheries since at least the early 1990s; one specimen of 100 cm total length was recorded off the southwest coast in 2019, and two specimens were caught by fishers off the southeast coast in 2014 (C.-H. Jeong pers. obs. 2019). In Taiwan, this species has not been observed for the past 20 years (H.

In some parts of Japan, the meat was previously highly valuable, particularly when flash boiled and sold as ubiki, but this process is difficult and not popular among younger people and the value of the meat has since declined. The skin is used to grind wasabi in Tokyo sushi restaurants (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The fins are typically small and also of relatively low value; smaller individuals are used for fish meal (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2020, D.

In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).  Since the late 1990s, Chinese regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling  in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12°N (Yu and  Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions. In 2018, this seasonal closure  was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet  and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow  small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm.  28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen  pers. comm. 28/08/2019).

The town of Fort-Liberte, which directly borders the bay, had a human population of 35,000 persons in the year 2015.

141788242,18584848,Pristis pristis,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2013,2013-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) formerly had a widespread tropical distribution, consisting of four subpopulations (Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific). A recent taxonomic review has shown that <em>P. perotteti </em>(Atlantic) and <em>P. microdon </em>(Indo-West Pacific) are synonymous with <em>P. pristis </em>and this Red List assessment replaces the previous (2006) assessments for those species. The Largetooth Sawfish is a large (6.5+ m total length) euryhaline species, with juveniles occurring in freshwater systems and adults in marine and estuarine environments (although in Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater). All subpopulations have undergone significant population declines and the species is now apparently extinct in many former range states. In most others, recent records are rare (e.g., there have been very few records in the Eastern Atlantic in the last decade). In the Western Atlantic, current records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish can only be regularly encountered today in the Amazon River basin, the Rio Colorado-Rio San Juan area in Nicaragua, and possibly some remote areas of French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana. In the Indo-West Pacific, northern Australia represents a globally important remaining population centre. Overall, a population reduction based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) of ≥80% over a period of three generations (i.e., 1960s to present) is inferred. Despite protection in some range states (e.g., Australia, India, Brazil, United States, Mexico; it is possibly extinct in the latter two range states), threats are ongoing and the species is assessed globally as Critically Endangered. <br/></p>","Available life history information on Largetooth Sawfish comes from in Lake Nicaragua in Central America (Thorson 1976; 1982) and from northern Australia.<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish are generally restricted to shallow (&lt;10 m) coastal, estuarine, and fresh waters, although they have been found at depths of up to 26 m in Lake Nicaragua. Largetooth Sawfish move across salinity gradients freely and in northern Australia, parturition probably occurs in brackish or saltwater and juveniles spend ~4–5 years in the freshwater reaches of rivers and floodplain waterholes before migrating to estuarine and marine waters (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2009, P. Kyne unpublished data). In Lake Nicaragua, individuals spent much, if not all, of their lives in freshwater with reproduction of the population occurring primarily in the lake (Thorson 1982).<br/><br/>The life history of Largetooth Sawfish, like many elasmobranchs, is characterised by slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, which generally contributes to a low intrinsic rate of increase. The maximum reported size of Largetooth Sawfish is 656 cm TL, although it has been estimated up to 700 cm TL (Compagno and Last 1999). Very large individuals are now rarely seen anywhere in the Indo-West Pacific.<br/><br/>The reproductive method of sawfishes is most likely lecithotrophic viviparity. The only known reproductive study of Largetooth Sawfish was from Lake Nicaragua in the 1970s (Thorson 1976) with other observations from northern Australia. Thorson (1976) found that both ovaries appeared to be functional, though the left seemed to be larger and carry more ova. Litter sizes in Lake Nicaragua were 1–13 (mean 7.3) following a gestation period of about five months. While the reproductive cycle is possibly biennial in the Western Atlantic (Thorson 1976), it appears to be annual in northern Australia (Peverell 2008).<br/><br/>Size at birth ranges 72–90 cm TL (Peverell 2008). Size at maturity is ~300 cm TL for females and ~280–300 cm TL for males (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2007, Peverell 2008, Whitty <em>et al</em>. 2008). Age at maturity in Queensland, northern Australia, has been estimated at 8–10 years (Peverell 2008). Peverell (2008) using a preliminary vertebral growth ring analysis estimated a maximum age of 35 years in northern Australia.<br/><br/>Using life history information from populations in Central America, Simpfendorfer (2000) estimated an intrinsic rate of increase of 0.05 to 0.07 per year and population doubling times of 10.3–13.6 years. These rates were estimated under ideal conditions (i.e. no fisheries, no population fragmentation, no habitat modification and no inbreeding depression). Moreno Iturria (2012) estimated an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.12 yr<sup>-1</sup>, a population doubling time of 5.8 yrs and a generation time of 14.6 yrs for Indo-West Pacific Largetooth Sawfish, and an intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.03 yr<sup>-1</sup>, a population doubling time of 23.3 yrs and a generation time of 17.2 yrs for Western Atlantic Largetooth Sawfish.","The principal threats to this species are from fishing; it was formerly targeted, but is now mostly taken incidentally in broad-spectrum fisheries (CITES 2007). The long toothed rostrums of sawfishes make them extraordinarily vulnerable to entanglement in any sort of net gear, gillnetting and trawling in particular. The exploitation of elasmobranchs is high in many parts of the Largetooth Sawfish’s range, particularly in coastal areas and freshwater systems. Unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation all threaten sawfishes across large parts of its range.<br/><br/>For at least part of its life cycle, the Largetooth Sawfish relies on a variety of specific habitat types including freshwater systems, estuaries and mangroves; these are all affected by human development (CITES 2007). Agricultural and urban development, commercial activities, dredge-and-fill operations, boating, erosion, and diversions of freshwater runoff as a result of continued coastal and catchment development has caused substantial loss or modification of these habitats (CITES 2007). Mining activities, in northern Australia, New Guinea (e.g., the Fly River) and elsewhere, pose a risk to Largetooth Sawfish through freshwater habitat alteration or potential pollution events. Alterations to river courses are a realised threat to Largetooth Sawfish which migrate upstream in early life stages. These range from smaller barrages and road crossing in northern Australia to large-scale river alterations in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>In West Africa, shark fishing increased significantly in the past several decades and ‘the intensive exploitation of sharks over the past thirty years has completely decimated the most vulnerable populations…’ (Diop and Dossa 2011). The disappearance of sawfish in the region was thought to have begun in the 1970s when new fishers entered the region and new fishing gear was developed (Diop and Dossa 2011). Threats are ongoing in the region and given that many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.<br/><br/>In the Western Atlantic, the main threats are region-wide gillnets used effectively in rivers, at river mouths, estuaries and nearshore waters (up to 200 km out in case of Amazon-Orinoco estuaries; P. Almeida pers. comm. 2012), and trawling. In the Eastern Pacific, Largetooth Sawfish were caught by gillnets, longlines and trawl nets.<br/><br/>In Australia, datasets indicate that net fisheries account for the greatest bycatch of sawfish (all species) across northern Australia (80.2%) followed by trawling (16.6%), line fishing (9.2%) and recreational fishing (0.3%) (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Largetooth Sawfish are captured by all these fishing activities (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004) and declines in Largetooth Sawfish are suspected based on potential levels of exploitation (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A survey across northern Australia from Western Australia to Queensland appears to support the assertion that fishing is responsible for declines, as it found greater numbers of sawfish in areas of lower fishing pressure (both commercial and recreational) (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The sustainability of Largetooth Sawfish populations in northern Australia is considered to be at high risk due to the cumulative effects of all fisheries, and the species’ low biological productivity and susceptibility to gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>A number of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australian inshore net fisheries continue to catch Largetooth Sawfish incidentally. Despite requirements to release these, there is no doubt a continuing level of bycatch-associated mortality.<br/><br/>The extent to which recreational fishers interact with Largetooth Sawfish across northern Australia is unknown, but in some areas where the species has been recorded, recreational fishing is a popular activity, which is increasing in popularity and could pose a threat to the species. In the Fitzroy River (WA), recreational fishers have been reported killing incidentally caught Largetooth Sawfish for the ‘trophy’ rostrum and for retrieval of fishing tackle (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Sawfish (non species-specific records) have been recorded in derelict fishing nets in northern Australian waters; the Gulf of Carpentaria is a particular hotspot for these ‘ghost nets’ (Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2010) and capture in these may result in sawfish mortality. Because of their toothed rostrum, sawfish may be exceptionally susceptible to entanglement in other types of marine debris, and entanglement has been reported in a number of types of marine debris (Seitz and Poulakis 2006). Entanglement in discarded or lost recreational fishing line may occur on occasion, as has been documented for Largetooth Sawfish in Western Australia (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2004).","<strong>Western Atlantic<br/></strong>The population size of this species in the Western Atlantic remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. Its abundance has been continuously declining over the past few decades to the point that it can now be considered rare or even extirpated in some areas where it was previously considered a common species. Burgess <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported on recent records of Largetooth Sawfish in the Western Atlantic. Over the last 10 years, records have only been consistently found in Brazil (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009). Records of fishermen still catching sawfish in Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras and Belize have been reported but are scarce (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). While the species is protected in some areas, illegal fishing and bycatch landings continue to occur which indicates the population still may be in decline except in the most remote areas.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Atlantic<br/></strong>The population size of this species in the Eastern Atlantic remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. Its abundance has been continuously declining over the past few decades to the point that it can now be considered rare or even extirpated in some areas where it was previously considered a common species. While records of the species still exist (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009), in many areas, the time between records is long indicating the population is still declining. Historic records of Largetooth Sawfish include most countries from Angola to Mauritania (Faria 2007, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, there have been only two countries with confirmed records for the region in the last 10 years (three animals in Guinea-Bissau in 2003, 2004 and 2005; one animal in Sierra Leonne in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (<em>Pristis </em>sp.) from two countries (three animals in Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and one animal in Mauritania 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in West Africa (Mika Diop pers. comm. 2012). Given many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific<br/></strong>The population size of this species in the Eastern Pacific remains unknown. There are no data or information on trends in abundance, thus the population status is inferred from reports of capture records. While historically found from Peru to Mexico, the only recent records (within the last 10 years) are from Columbia, Nicaragua, and Panama (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). Costa Rica’s Osa Peninsula, which encompasses the Corcovado National Park’s Rio Sirena and the Térraba-Sierpe Wetland are thought to host a remnant population of sawfish, based on fisher interviews of recent but unconfirmed sightings (I. Zanella pers. comm. 2011). However, in the contiguous Golfo Dulce (Costa Rica), artisanal hook and line and net fishers interviewed in 2004 reported that they had not seen a sawfish in decades (R.T. Graham pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish existed in Panama’s Pacific-draining man-made Lake Bayano in 1982 (Montoya and Thorson 1982), but there are no recent records from that site or other parts of Panama or nearby Colombia, based on an IUCN Shark Specialist Group (SSG) survey of members and researchers sent out by the SSG in 2011–2012. The species may now possibly be extinct in several countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru; there are no confirmed records in many parts of the region for the past decade. This represents a significant contraction in the species’ extent of occurrence in the Eastern Pacific. There are some poorly studied parts of the region with suitable sawfish habitat (e.g., the Darien, Panama), suggesting that surveys are required to locate any remnant populations.<br/><br/>Given the degree of mangrove loss and the level of artisanal net fishing, it is likely that the remnant population is still in decline.<br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific<br/></strong>There are almost no data on population status of Largetooth Sawfish across the Indo-West Pacific; all populations are, however, probably severely depleted.<br/><br/>Landings of Largetooth Sawfish are now extremely rare in former range states of the Western and Northern Indian Ocean. Although the St Lucia estuary system of South Africa was once an important breeding area, sawfishes (including Largetooth Sawfish) now appear to be extinct in that country. They also now appear to be absent from southern Mozambique (S. Pierce pers. comm. 2012) and while once common in the Zambezi River (Wallace 1967) no recent sightings have been documented. Madagascar, the Seychelles, Pakistan and India, amongst other Indian Ocean range states, have all seen depletions of sawfishes, including Largetooth Sawfish. Sawfish were previously common in artisanal fishing catches on the western coast of Madagascar, but are now extremely rare along that coast (Manach <em>et al</em>. 2011). There are no sawfish records from the Seychelles in the last decade (D. Rowat pers. comm. 2012), and a 2009 record of a Largetooth Sawfish in Gwadar, western Balochistan, Pakistan (A. Rahim pers. comm. 2012) represents a very rare event. Surveys with fishers in Raigad District (Maharashtra state) of India (where sawfishes were commonly harvested historically) indicate a drastic decline in the sawfish fishery from 1985–1990, with only occasional catches in recent years (R. Raut pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, localised depletions and extinctions of sawfishes have been reported or inferred from across the region. During some eleven years of market surveys (over 160 visits to 11 market sites) in various parts of Indonesia only two individual sawfish (both Largetooth Sawfish) were recorded which were caught in the Arafura/Banda Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2012) and possibly came from illegal fishing in Australian waters. Demersal elasmobranchs are intensively targeted in Indonesia (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009), and this extremely low occurrence (out of some 60,000 chondrichthyans examined) is indicative of severely depleted populations in Indonesia. In fact, it is thought that sawfishes are extinct from large areas of Indonesia. Despite the presence of sawfish rostra in houses near fishing ports, local Indonesian fishermen indicate that they have not seen sawfishes for more than 20 or 30 years (W. White pers. comm. 2012). Populations in Borneo are thought to be seriously depleted (Last et al. 2010). In Sabah (Malaysian Borneo), fishers and villagers reported sawfish as abundant in the 1970s and declining sharply in the 1980s, with very limited catches since that time (Manjaji 2002). The last known record from the Kinabatangan River was in 1996 (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Datasets from as early as 1963–1972 showed the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979), which included the virtual disappearance of sawfish (Pauly 1988). Declines in demersal fishes in the Thai Andaman Sea were also documented (Pauly 1979) and these likely included sawfishes. In contrast, historic accounts indicated that sawfishes were ‘common’ and caught in ‘considerable numbers’ in Thailand, including in rivers (Smith 1945). Within the Cambodian Mekong system, numbers of Largetooth Sawfish have reportedly decreased considerably. Historically, they were regularly seen as far upstream as Khoné Falls, and in other areas of the Mekong (Tonlé Sap and Great Lake), none have been seen for ‘several decades’ (Rainboth 1996).<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish were considered common in the Philippines by Herre (1953) but none were recorded in more recent surveys and it is thought that the population ‘has greatly declined in the Philippines’ (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Largetooth Sawfish had previously been described as common in the middle reaches and large tributaries of the Fly River, Papua New Guinea (Roberts 1978) but its status there requires reappraisal. More recently, the ‘demise’ of the species has been reported in Lake Sentani, West Papua as a result of the change from traditional fishing methods to the use of gill nets (Polhemus <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>All sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines in Australia. In places, viable populations persist, representing some of the last viable populations in the Indo-West Pacific, with Australia being one of a limited number of global strongholds for sawfishes (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005, DSEWPaC 2011a). Genetic data indicate that Largetooth Sawfish has moderate levels of genetic diversity and male-biased dispersal in Australian waters (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011, Phillips 2012). Genetic evidence suggests that females have strong reproductive philopatry (returning to sites previously used for reproduction), with maternal population structuring between Western Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria, with the northern coast of the Northern Territory and the Queensland east coast populations also potentially forming distinct maternal populations (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011). In contrast, males disperse between at least Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria (Phillips 2012).<br/><br/>Species-specific data to accurately ascertain the status of Australian sawfishes is generally lacking and the evidence for decline and range contraction is largely anecdotal. Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program, which operates ‘bather protection’ fishing gear along the Queensland east coast, shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 30 year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern Queensland (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). All Pristis species are now extremely rare along the Australian east coast (the area in which human population and habitat modification is greatest) where they have undergone a considerable range contraction. Although populations across northern Australia have undergone significant reduction and their status is uncertain, Australian populations are considered some of the highest in the world.<br/><br/>While specific management measures are now in place in Australia, including full species protection, education of fishers about safe release practices, and fishery-specific management, threats are ongoing and there is no information to suggest that the population is recovering from previous declines.<br/><br/>Across the Indo-West Pacific, a population reduction of ≥80% is inferred based on a reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) over a period of three generations (i.e., 1969 to present). Declines and continuing threats (much of the species’ Indo-West Pacific range, with the exception of northern Australia, is subject to intense human pressure, particularly through generally unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation in critical sawfish habitats) are resulting in the continual declines of remnant populations. The Australian population of Largetooth Sawfish likely comprises a high proportion of the global population (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Decreasing,"The Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) comprises four distinct subpopulations: Eastern Atlantic, Western Atlantic, Eastern Pacific and Indo-West Pacific.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Atlantic</strong><br/>The current distribution of Largetooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species identification issues, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Largetooth Sawfish were historically found along the coast of West Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). Historic records indicate that Largetooth Sawfish were once relatively common in the coastal estuaries of West Africa. Verified records exist from Senegal (1841–1902), Gambia (1885–1909), Guinea-Bissau (1912), Republic of Guinea (1965), Sierra Leone (date unknown), Liberia (1927), Côte d’Ivoire (1881–1923), Congo (1951–1958), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1951–1959), and Angola (1951) (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009). Most records, however, lack data and locality and may have been confused taxonomically with other species. Unpublished notes from a 1950’s survey detail 12 Largetooth Sawfish from Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire, and Nigeria. The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead et al. 1984, Bilecenoğlu and Taşkavak 1999). There have been only two countries with confirmed records for the region in the last 10 years (Guinea-Bissau in 2003, 2004 and 2005; Sierra Leonne in 2003) and unconfirmed records (<em>Pristis </em>sp.) from one other country (Mauritania in 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in West Africa (Mika Diop pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Although Largetooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or as a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off West Africa.<br/><br/><strong>Western Atlantic</strong><br/>In the Western Atlantic, Largetooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Largetooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and seasonally to the United States (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009, Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). Currently, Largetooth Sawfish are thought to primarily occur in freshwater habitats in Central and South America. Largetooth Sawfish have been recorded in locations at least 1,340 km from the ocean in the Amazon River, as well as in Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River and other east coast Nicaraguan rivers. The species has also been reported in coastal systems in Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana and Columbia in South America. In Central America, scattered reports still exist for Largetooth Sawfish in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Belize. In Mexico, the lack of records may indicate the species is no longer found west of the Yucatan Peninsula (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012). Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the species presence was historically uncertain and early records may have been Smalltooth Sawfish (P. pectinata). Though historically reported in the United States, it appears that Largetooth Sawfish were never abundant and was likely a season migrant. The species has not been reported in the United States since the 1960s (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific<br/></strong>In the Eastern Pacific, the historic range of Largetooth Sawfish was limited by the cooler water currents to the north of its range (California current) and the Humboldt Current in the south (V. Faria pers. comm. 2012). The historic range is thought to occur from Mazatlán, Mexico to Peru (Chirichigno and Cornejo 2001, Cook <em>et al</em>. 2005, Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other references (i.e., Amezcua-Linares 2009) suggest that it occurred south from Topolobampo (some 440 km further north than Mazatlán), highlighting the uncertainty over its historic range. The occurrence of Largetooth Sawfish in Peru may have represented seasonal migration from the species’ core range in Central America. Largetooth Sawfish were historically reported from a number of freshwater systems in the Eastern Pacific (as summarised by Cook <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific</strong><br/>The Indo-West Pacific subpopulation of the Largetooth Sawfish was formerly wide-ranging from parts of the Western Indian Ocean through India, the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia to New Guinea and northern Australia. Its current distribution is now patchy across its range. It had been confirmed from several major river systems of Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Malaysia (including Borneo), Cambodia, Viet Nam and the Philippines (Roberts 1978, Tan and Lim 1998, Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Its occurrence in many of these is now uncertain or non-existent. It may now be extinct in several range states, including South Africa, the Seychelles, Thailand and others; elsewhere it has been severely depleted.<br/><br/>Northern Australia may be the last viable population stronghold in the Indo-West Pacific, although it may persist in remote parts of the region. It occurs across tropical northern Australia from the northeastern coast of Queensland, across Cape York, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region (Western Australia). It has occurred as a vagrant to southwestern Australia (Last and Stevens 2009).","While international trade sawfishes is banned under the species’ listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), illegal international trade may still exist due to the high value of their products.<br/><br/>The exploitation of elasmobranchs is high in many parts of the Largetooth Sawfish’s global range, and there is no doubt that it is still caught, landed and traded.<br/><br/>McDavitt (2005) reviewed all available information related to sawfish trade and identified six sawfish parts, derived mostly from sawfish captured as bycatch in fisheries, which were historically or currently found in trade. These sawfish parts identified in trade are: fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs and skin.<br/><br/>The fins of sawfish are used to produce shark fin soup and sawfish fins are highly favored in Asian markets (NMFS 2009). Because of their large fins with high fin needle content, fins of species in the family Pristidae are highly valued for shark fin soup (CITES 2007).<br/><br/>Sawfish rostra are often traded as curios, ceremonial weapons, or for use in traditional medicines (NMFS 2009). Rostra have long been a favorite marine curio (Migdalski 1981), with large rostra commanding impressive prices (McDavitt 1996). Organized curio trade in rostra of species in the family Pristidae has recently been reported in Brazil (Charvet-Almeida 2002, McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). It was estimated that 90–180 large rostra are purchased annually by Asian buyers from the main fish market in northern Brazil, presumably for the curio trade (McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). Local artisans in Brazil sometimes decorate medium-sized pristid rostra (usually Largetooth Sawfish) for sale to tourists. Overall, an estimated 1,000–1,500 small- to medium-sized rostra are sold per year from this same market for a variety of purposes (McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004). The use of rostra in traditional medicine includes some use in Mexico and Brazil (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Rostral teeth of species in the family Pristidae have been the preferred material used to manufacture artificial spurs on Peruvian fighting cocks (Cogorno Ventura 2001). The rostral teeth are mostly obtained from Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and various Caribbean countries (CITES 2007). Charvet-Almeida (2002) and McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida (2004) determined that rostra find their way into the international cockfighting market from Brazil.<br/><br/>Sawfish are regularly used for their meat; however, most of the consumption is local and so they appear to be only occasionally traded beyond local markets (NMFS 2009). In the north of Brazil, Charvet-Almeida (2002) reported a limited market for meat, rostra and rostral teeth of fish in the family Pristidae.<br/><br/>Chinese traditional medicine also uses other sawfish parts, including liver, ova and gall bladder (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Sawfish skin has been used to produce leather, which, like shark leather, is considered of very high quality (NMFS 2009). The leather is used to make belts, boots, purses, and even to cover books (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Sawfishes are highly prized as display animals in public aquariums due to their large size, bizarre shape, and shark-like features (McDavitt 1996, NMFS 2009). Prior to the uplisting of ‘<em>Pristis microdon</em>’ to CITES Appendix I at the 16th Conference of Parties in 2013, it was listed on Appendix II (in 2007) ‘for the exclusive purpose of allowing international trade in live animals to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes’. This legal international trade in Largetooth Sawfish for aquaria originated only from Australia and involved a small number of Largetooth Sawfish. In 2011, Australia determined that it was not able to issue a Non-Detriment Finding, ruling that ‘it is not possible to conclude with a reasonable level of certainty that any harvest of <em>P. microdon</em> for export purposes would not be detrimental to the survival or recovery of the species’ (DSEWPaC 2011b). As such, there has been no export since 2011. Domestic harvest for aquariums in ongoing in Australia with juveniles periodically collected in the Northern Territory and Queensland.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific, Largetooth Sawfish were used for human consumption (meat) (McEachran 1995), or for ornamental purposes (Amezcua-Linares 2009), as well as the other uses outlined above. Sawfish have been historically highly valued for fins, meats and liver oil in the Indo-West Pacific. India has traditionally been a regional hub in the shark fin trade, collecting fins from around the Western Indian Ocean (e.g., Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf, Indian subcontinent), and shipping these to the main markets of Singapore and Hong Kong (M.T. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012). Trade in shark fin is significant throughout Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>In northern Australia, the meat of sawfish is sometimes utilised by Indigenous communities but the extent to which Indigenous Australians harvest and utilise Largetooth Sawfish is unknown; it is likely localised and at a low rate.<br/><br/>See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All species of sawfish are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans commercial international trade in sawfish or their parts.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Atlantic<br/></strong>Sawfish are protected in the Exclusive Economic Zone in Guinea and Senegal and in Marine Protected Areas in Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau (S.V. Fordham pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Western Atlantic<br/></strong>Largetooth Sawfish are protected in Brazil. The commercial fishery for both shark and sawfish is banned in Lake Nicaragua and all take of Largetooth Sawfish is banned in Mexico (where it already appears to be extinct). Largetooth Sawfish are also listed as Endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific<br/></strong>All take of Largetooth Sawfish is banned in Mexico (where it already appears to be extinct). Elsewhere throughout the Pacific range of Largetooth Sawfish, there are no conservation or management measures, and these are urgently needed.<br/><br/><strong>Indo-West Pacific<br/></strong>Within Australia, Largetooth Sawfish has the following conservation and protected status listings: Australian Commonwealth waters, Vulnerable (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999); Queensland, Protected (Fisheries Act 1994); Northern Territory (NT), Vulnerable (Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000); Western Australia (WA), Totally Protected (Fish Resources Management Act 1994). The take of the species is therefore prohibited within Australian Commonwealth, state and territory waters.<br/><br/>In addition to the above legislated regulations, the Commonwealth, Queensland, NT and WA all have fisheries management plans in place for interactions with protected species, including Largetooth Sawfish. These include mandatory reporting of interactions with these species, release of live animals, observer coverage of most of the fisheries (although this is very low in state and territory fisheries which are likely to interact with Largetooth Sawfish) and education programmes for fishers on identification and ways to minimise interactions with this species. The Queensland Government has published a guide to the safe release of sawfish for commercial fishers (DEEDI 2010) and NT shark fishers have a Code of Practice for the release of live sawfish from gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Several spatial closures in riverine, estuarine and coastal waters in the NT Barramundi Fishery offer Largetooth Sawfish some refuge from commercial gillnet fishing activities in the NT. Closed areas within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the closure of rivers in Princess Charlotte Bay to gillnetting may also afford some protection. Seasonal spawning closures for the take of Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) (mostly during the summer wet season) throughout much of the range add a level of protection to the species, however, information on Largetooth Sawfish long-term movement patterns and habitat use are required in order to assess the benefits of closed areas and seasons not specifically designed for sawfish.<br/><br/>In northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries, the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) is mandatory, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In one study, they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), however, they and other sawfish species are still being caught as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, awareness needs to be raised, and regulations put in place to protect all sawfishes and promote population recovery. While sawfishes (including Largetooth) are theoretically protected in India (Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act), threats continue with little beneficial management, although increasing awareness of sawfishes in India is encouraging. Largetooth Sawfish are also protected in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. Although protected in these range states, the lack of enforcement or specific fisheries regulations, and ongoing gillnet and trawl fisheries, means that the threats are ongoing.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is rare but present in Honduras, Belize, Cuba, Sierra Leone, and possibly Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania. Threats to Smalltooth Sawfish <span lang=""EN-CA"">still exist today in areas where sawfish are unprotected and habitat modification (mangrove removal) and inshore netting still occurs.</span></span>","Currently, life history information for the Smalltooth Sawfish is only available for the Western Atlantic and it assumed that life history parameters are similar for conspecifics throughout the Atlantic Ocean. This species is lecithotrophic viviparous and litter size is thought to be 15–20 pups (Simpfendorfer 2005) born every other year, but there are little supporting data for this. Demographic analysis using early reports of life history and estimates from other pristids indicated that Smalltooth Sawfish intrinsic rate of increase ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 yr<sup>−1</sup>, and population doubling times from 5.4 to 8.5 yrs (Simpfendorfer 2000).<br/><br/>There is still some question regarding age and size at maturity for Smalltooth Sawfish. Simpfendorfer (2005) reported maturity at 360 cm TL for females. However, females of 300–400 cm stretched total length (STL) necropsied from the US were immature, with the smallest mature female examined being 415 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Males were thought to be mature about 270 cm TL (Simpfendorfer 2005). However, a recently necropsied male Smalltooth Sawfish that was 308 cm TL was found to be immature (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The smallest mature male from field-collected specimens was 371 cm STL (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). Back-transforming these lengths into ages using the von Bertalanffy growth model of Scharer <em>et al</em>. (2012) indicates that males mature around 7.5 years and females 10–12 years. As these data indicate much faster growth and earlier maturation than previously determined, any updated demographic model will likely indicate higher productivity and rebound potential. Moreno Iturria (2012) constructed a deterministic model based on standard life table techniques using growth estimates from Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. (2008) and calculated demographic parameters for Smalltooth Sawfish for US waters. Intrinsic rates of increase were estimated as 0.07 per year, generation time 17 years and population doubling time 9.7 years.<br/><br/>Recent information on tag-recaptured juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish collected in Florida, USA, indicates substantially faster growth than previously assumed for this species. Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that growth was rapid during the first two years after birth.<br/><br/>Using data from reported encounters from 1998 to 2008, Wiley and Simpfendorfer (2010) evaluated Smalltooth Sawfish habitat use patterns in the US. There was an inverse relationship between sawfish size and extent of northern distribution, with animals less than 200 cm having a wider latitudinal distribution and occurring farthest north, and animals greater than 200 cm reported mostly in southern Florida (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010). Most encounters occurred in estuarine and nearshore habitats, and their locations were not randomly distributed, having a positive association with inshore mangrove and seagrass habitats. While sawfish were reported in depths to 73 m, there was a significant relationship between size and depth, with smaller animals occurring in shallower waters (Wiley and Simpfendorfer 2010).<br/><br/>Data from acoustic telemetry and tag-recapture information indicates Smalltooth Sawfish (less than 100 cm) had the smallest home ranges, low linearity of movement, and a preference for very shallow mud banks (Simpfendorfer et al. 2010). Juveniles greater than 100 cm demonstrated larger home ranges, preference for shallow mud/sand banks, and remained close to mangrove shorelines. Tide was found to be the main factor influencing movement on short time scales. Sawfish &lt;150 cm STL spend the majority of their time in water &lt;0.5 m deep, while larger juveniles spend most of their time in water 0.5–1.0 m deep. Juveniles &gt;130 cm had high levels of site fidelity for specific nursery areas for periods up to almost 3 months, but the smaller juveniles had relatively short site fidelity to specific locations (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Based on data from catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), Poulakis <em>et al</em>. (2011) found that most juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish had an affinity for water less than 1.0 m deep, water temperature over 30ºC, dissolved oxygen over 6 mg/L, and salinity between 18 and 30. Greater catch rates for sawfish over age one were associated with shoreline habitats with overhanging vegetation such as mangroves (Poulakis <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. (2011) conducted a long-term tracking study and found mean daily activity space was 1.42 km of river distance. The distance between 30-minute centres of activity was typically 0.1 km, suggesting limited movement over short time scales. Salinity electivity analysis demonstrated an affinity for salinities between 18 and at least 24, suggesting movements are likely made in part, to remain within this range (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The US National Marine Fisheries Service designated critical habitat for the US distinct population segment of Smalltooth Sawfish (Norton <em>et al</em>. 2012). The nursery habitats essential to the conservation of the species were identified as those adjacent to red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and euryhaline habitats with water depths less than or equal to 0.9 m (Norton <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>For adult sawfish, unpublished data from pop-off archival satellite transmitting (PAT) tags indicate Smalltooth Sawfish spend the majority of their time in shallow waters (&lt;10 m deep) and prefer temperatures between 22°C and 28°C (J.K. Carlson unpublished data). The maximum recorded depth for Smalltooth Sawfish is 88 m.","The principal threats to Smalltooth Sawfish are from fishing; it was formerly targeted, but is now mostly taken incidentally in broad-spectrum fisheries (CITES 2007). The long toothed rostrum of sawfish makes them extremely vulnerable to entanglement in any sort of net gear, gillnetting and trawling in particular. Depleted populations mean that commercial targeting of most stocks is no longer cost-effective and bycatch mortality is now the primary threat to Smalltooth Sawfish (CITES 2007). However, there are indications that sawfish are at times targeted opportunistically for the shark fin trade (CITES 2007). There have been some large-scale fisheries targeting the species, including in the southeastern US in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and possibly in Brazil from the 1960s to 1980s (CITES 2007).<br/><br/>In West Africa, shark fishing increased significantly in the past several decades and ‘the intensive exploitation of sharks over the past thirty years has completely decimated the most vulnerable populations…’ (Diop and Dossa 2011). The disappearance of sawfish in the region was thought to have begun in the 1970s when new fishers entered the region and new fishing gear was developed (Diop and Dossa 2011). Threats are ongoing in the region and given that many areas still have artisanal gillnet fisheries with little or no regulation, it is likely the population will continue to decline.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation and loss also threaten sawfishes throughout their range (CITES 2007). The Smalltooth Sawfish relies on a variety of specific habitat types including estuaries and mangroves; these are all affected by human development (CITES 2007). Agricultural and urban development, commercial activities, dredge-and-fill operations, boating, erosion, and diversions of freshwater runoff as a result of continued coastal and catchment development has caused substantial loss or modification of these habitats (CITES 2007).<span lang=""EN-CA"">","At the end of the 19th century the Smalltooth Sawfish was common in inshore waters of the western North Atlantic (e.g., Goode 1884, Henshall 1895, Jordan and Evermann 1896, Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). In the United States, the Smalltooth Sawfish population appears to have declined dramatically during the middle and later parts of the 20th century (Simpfendorfer 2002). Based on the contraction of the range and declines in landings, it is likely that the US population size is currently less than 5% of its size at the time of European settlement (Simpfendorfer 2002). However, the population of Smalltooth Sawfish may have stabilised in the United States. Based on genetic sampling, estimates of the current effective population size range of the US population of Smalltooth Sawfish were from 269.6–504.9 individuals (95% Confidence Interval 139.3–1,515) (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2011).Carlson and Osborne (2012) reported the relative abundance of sawfish increased at an average rate of about 3–5% per year since 1989 based on of voluntary dockside interviews of sport fishers in the US. Despite a low population size in the US, the Smalltooth Sawfish population will probably retain &gt;90% of its current genetic diversity over the next century (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Western Atlantic, no data on population size or trends in abundance exist outside of US waters, and the only information on trends in the population can be inferred from anecdotal capture records. While early records of this species include most countries throughout Central and South America, records and reports indicate Smalltooth Sawfish can now only be reliably encountered in the Bahamas (where suitable habitat is available), Honduras, Belize, and Cuba.<br/><br/>There are no data on population size for the Eastern Atlantic and the only information on trends in the population can be inferred from anecdotal capture records. Smalltooth Sawfish were once common in western African waters, but today records are sparse. Early records of this species include most countries from Angola to Mauritania. Specific records on length and sex of individuals come from Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, there has been only one confirmed record for the region in the last 10 years (Sierra Leone in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (<em>Pristis </em>sp.) from only two other countries (Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and Mauritania 2010). It is likely that areas around Guinea-Bissau represent the last areas where sawfish can be found in western Africa (M. Diop pers. comm. 2012).",Decreasing,"In the Western Atlantic Ocean, Smalltooth Sawfish were widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical marine and estuarine waters. Smalltooth Sawfish were found from Uruguay through the Caribbean and Central America, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast of the United States (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, Smalltooth Sawfish has been wholly or nearly extirpated from large areas of its former range. The species is currently known to occur in the southeastern United States (Simpfendorfer 2002), Bahamas (D. Grubbs pers. comm. 2012), Cuba, Honduras and Belize (R. Graham pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>The current distribution of Smalltooth Sawfish in the Eastern Atlantic is uncertain due to species misidentification, lack of reporting, and the general contraction of its range. Smalltooth Sawfish was historically found along the coast of western Africa from Angola to Mauritania (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). There has been only one confirmed record for the region in the last 10 years (Sierra Leone in 2003). There are unconfirmed records (<em>Pristis </em>sp.) from only two other countries (Guinea-Bissau in 2011, and Mauritania 2010).<br/><br/>The presence of sawfishes in the Mediterranean Sea is still uncertain (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1984, Bilecenoğlu and Taşkavak 1999). Although Smalltooth Sawfish were included in historic faunal lists (Serena 2005), it is still debatable whether sawfishes occurred as part of the Mediterranean ichthyofauna or are a vagrant species as seasonal migrants from areas off western Africa. Reports of Smalltooth Sawfish outside of the Atlantic Ocean are likely misidentifications of other sawfish species (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). <span lang=""EN-CA"">","While international trade in sawfishes is banned under the species’ listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), illegal international trade may still exist due to the high value of their products.<br/><br/>McDavitt (2005) reviewed all available information related to sawfish trade and identified six sawfish parts, derived mostly from sawfish captured as bycatch in fisheries, which were historically or currently found in trade. These sawfish parts identified in trade are: fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs and skin. It appears that the commercial trade in Smalltooth Sawfish parts from the US population is currently minimal due to their rarity. However, the demand for fins and rostrums provides a motivation to kill sawfish, a threat that will become increasingly significant as the population recovers (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>The fins of sawfish are used to produce shark fin soup and sawfish fins are highly favored in Asian markets (NMFS 2009). Because of their large fins with high fin needle content, fins of species in the family Pristidae are highly valued for shark fin soup (CITES 2007).<br/><br/>Sawfish rostra are often traded as curios, ceremonial weapons, or for use in traditional medicines (NMFS 2009). Rostra have long been a favorite marine curio (Migdalski 1981), with large rostra commanding impressive prices (McDavitt 1996).<br/><br/>Rostral teeth of species in the family Pristidae have been the preferred material used to manufacture artificial spurs on Peruvian fighting cocks (Cogorno Ventura 2001). The rostral teeth are mostly obtained from Brazil, Ecuador, Panama and various Caribbean countries (CITES 2007). In the north of Brazil, Charvet-Almeida (2002) reported a limited market for meat, rostra and rostral teeth of sawfishes.<br/><br/>Sawfish are regularly used for their meat. However, most of the consumption is local and so they appear to be only occasionally traded beyond local markets (NMFS 2009). Sawfish meat has been utilised historically in the US; Romer (1936) reported that sawfish were the second most common elasmobranch species taken in the shark fishery in the Florida Keys during the 1930s (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Sawfish liver has also been used as a source of liver oil and the fishery in the Florida Keys described by Romer (1936) used livers as a source of vitamin A (NMFS 2009). The use of livers as a source of vitamin A stopped during the 1940s when cheap synthetic forms became available (NMFS 2009). Chinese traditional medicine also uses other sawfish parts, including liver, ova and gall bladder (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Sawfish skin has been used to produce leather, which, like shark leather, is considered of very high quality (NMFS 2009). The leather is used to make belts, boots, purses, and even to cover books (NMFS 2009).<br/><br/>Species in the family Pristidae are highly prized as exhibit animals in public aquaria because of their charismatic nature (McDavitt 1996). Sawfish have been exhibited in large public aquaria for over 50 years. Their large size, bizarre shape, and shark-like features have made them popular additions to shark aquaria exhibits worldwide (NMFS 2009). Since their Endangered Species Act listing, NMFS has not granted any permits to take live Smalltooth Sawfish for public display although there has been some trade between institutions that house these sawfish, but no new specimens have been added (NMFS 2009). To meet the demand for sawfish for public display, US aquaria turned to suppliers in Australia who supplied the Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) (NMFS 2009). However, Largetooth Sawfish can no longer be exported from Australia.<br/><br/>See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"All species of sawfish are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans commercial international trade in sawfish or their parts.<br/><br/>National protections for Smalltooth Sawfish have been adopted in the United States. Smalltooth Sawfish were listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2003 which makes it illegal to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or to attempt to engage in any such conduct with Smalltooth Sawfish. ‘Critical Habitat’ has also been established for juvenile Smalltooth Sawfish in the US (NMFS 2009, Norton <em>et al</em>. 2012), which is a key conservation objective, designed to facilitate recruitment into the adult sawfish population by protecting juvenile nursery areas.<br/><br/>Outside US waters, Nicaragua imposed a permanent ban on targeted sawfish fishing in Lake Nicaragua. In Brazil, the Smalltooth Sawfish is protected (no take) by the Ministry of Environment and in Mexico the take of all sawfishes is banned.

141792003,39393,Pristis zijsron,Critically Endangered,A2cd,2013,2012-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Green Sawfish (<em>Pristis zijsron</em>) is probably the largest of the sawfish species, reaching lengths in excess of 7 m, although currently lengths greater than 6 m are rare. Historically, it occurred widely in the Indo-West Pacific from southern Africa to Australia and Taiwan, including the Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf and some of the Indian Ocean islands. The Green Sawfish is a coastal species, with the young occurring in shallow nearshore waters, while the adults are more common offshore in waters to &gt;70 m. Its life history is poorly known, with data from the Gulf of Carpentaria (northern Australia) indicating that it has low intrinsic rates of population increase, making its resilience to fishing pressure low and its recovery from depletion slow. While the current population size and historic abundance is unknown, it is suspected as having declined in all of its range states. In Australian waters, its range has been well documented to have contracted significantly. Like all sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Green Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets. Historically, the population has been negatively affected by commercial net and trawl fisheries which operate in inshore areas throughout most of its range, the cumulative impacts of which have led to population declines. This species is now protected by no-take status in some range states (e.g. Australia, Bahrain, India), is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and is protected by some areas that are closed to fishing; but these actions alone will not be sufficient to ensure its survival in most regions. Despite a lack of quantitative data to support declines, available information indicates that populations of Green Sawfish are considerably rarer than historically across its entire range. Australia has some of the last remaining viable populations of Green Sawfish in the world, albeit at significantly reduced levels. Declines in the population are suspected to exceed 80% over three generation lengths (~44 yr), and it is possible that there has been localised extinction in a number of range states due to intensive fishing, reducing its extent of occurrence, and supporting its listing as Critically Endangered.</p>","Green Sawfish are most common in shallow water coastal and estuarine areas, but occur to depths to over 70 m (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). A 3.5 m female tracked in the Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia) over a 27 hour period remained in shallow water (mean depth &lt;1 m) and within 200 m of a mangrove shoreline (Peverell and Pillans 2004). Similarly, a 2.5 m male tracked in northwestern Australia showed similar movements, remaining in nearshore waters &lt;1.5 m deep (Stevens et al. 2008). The young are known to use nearshore and estuarine areas as nurseries, and adults occur more broadly and into deeper areas as evidenced by the occurrence of large mature individuals in offshore trawl fisheries in northwestern Australia (Stephenson and Chidlow 2003).<br/><br/>Green Sawfish may be the largest of the sawfishes, with reports of individuals in excess of 7 m total length (TL). However, most reports suggest lengths over 6 m TL are currently rare. Mean size at birth in the Gulf of Carpentaria is 76 cm TL, and size at maturity at 340 to 380 cm TL (Peverell 2008, Last and Stevens 2009). Age and growth based on specimens from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate that maturity is reached at about nine years, and maximum age may be &gt;50 years (Peverell 2008). Little is known of reproductive biology. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and litter size is about 12. Demographic models based on life history data from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate that the generation time is 14.6 years, the intrinsic rate of population increase is very low (0.02 yr<sup>-1</sup>), and population doubling time is ~28 years (Moreno Iturria 2012).","Fishing is the primary threat to Green Sawfish. The large, toothed rostrum is easily entangled in fishing nets and other gear. In particular, inshore gillnet and trawl fisheries, which are common and intensive throughout much of the range of Green Sawfish, pose the greatest threat. Sawfishes are rarely targeted in these fisheries, but are regularly taken as retained bycatch because of the value of their fins, rostrum and meat. Data from specific fisheries is sparse, and rarely if ever to species level, making conclusions about the exact extent of the threats difficult to determine.<br/><br/>Data for northern Australia is probably the most comprehensive, and shows that gillnets were responsible for ~80% of records of sawfish captures (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). The gillnet fisheries in northern Australia that are likely, or known, to interact with Green Sawfish include the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011), Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Gillnet Fishery (Peverell 2005), Gulf of Carpentaria Offshore Gillnet Fishery (Peverell 2005), Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), and the Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery. Prawn trawl fisheries known, or suspected, to interact with Green Sawfish include the Northern Prawn Fishery, Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery, and smaller prawn fisheries in Western Australia (e.g. Exmouth and Onslow) and New South Wales (NSW). The species is also known from fish trawl fisheries in northern Australia (Pilbara, Gulf of Carpentaria and Northern Territory). The take of Green Sawfish in recreational line fisheries is likely to occur at low levels, and recent education campaigns in Australia have aimed to reduce mortalities associated with these interactions. Outside of Australia the recent take of Green Sawfish in fisheries is poorly documented, partly because of its disappearance from many areas.<br/><br/>Ecological risk assessments of fisheries in northern Australia that interact with Green Sawfish have demonstrated that this species is one of the most at-risk elasmobranch species within the region. Its large size, low biological productivity, propensity for entanglement, and high value of products all contribute to this vulnerability (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010). Similar conclusions can be made for similar fisheries throughout its range. More detailed assessment of trawl data from Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery indicated that the recent level of take was close to the sustainable limit (Zhou and Griffiths 2008), and when combined with the gillnet take in the same area, would undoubtedly be in excess of the level of sustainable take. As such, even in Australian waters, threats to this species are ongoing and populations are likely to continue to decline. <br/><br/>Green Sawfish are also taken in shark control programs in NSW, Queensland (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004) and South Africa. The capture of Green Sawfish on all of these programs is now nonexistent (NSW and South Africa) or extremely rare (Queensland).<br/><br/>Other threats to Green Sawfish include habitat loss (particularly loss of intertidal areas, and coastal development), pollution, loss of genetic diversity and climate change. However, relative to fishing, these threats are unlikely to substantially affect global status.","Data from northern Australia shows low to moderate levels of genetic diversity, with the lowest genetic diversity in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Populations in Western Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria are distinct genetic stocks, with the remnant east coast population potentially also forming a distinct population (Phillips <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011, Phillips 2012). Genetic data is not available for the remainder of the range, but given the Australian data the global population is likely to consist of a number of stocks.<br/><br/>There are very limited data available on the size and trend of the Green Sawfish population, either at the global or national scale. In Australian waters, all sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines; the southern extent of the range of Green Sawfish on the Australian east coast has contracted from Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), to the Whitsunday region of Queensland (Harry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). The last records from NSW were in 1972 (NSWDPI 2007) and in Moreton Bay (Queensland) in the 1960s (Johnson 1999). Extensive surveys of fish landing sites throughout Indonesia since 2001 have failed to observe this species (W. White pers. comm. 2012), suggesting that its occurrence in this region is now questionable. There is some evidence from the Persian (Arabian) Gulf (A. Moore pers. comm. 2012) and Red Sea (e.g. Sudan) of small but extant populations. The lack of data from surveys and fisheries in much of the remainder of its range suggests that the abundance of this species has declined significantly in most, if not all, areas, and is now at only a small fraction of its historic abundance. A population decline of &gt;80% is suspected across the global range over the period of the last three generations.",Decreasing,"<p>Green Sawfish have a broad Indo-West Pacific distribution, from South Africa north along the east coast of Africa, through the Red Sea, Persian (Arabian) Gulf, southern Asia, Indo-Australian archipelago, and east Asia as far north as Taiwan and southern China (Fowler 1941, Blegvad and Løppenthin 1944, Smith 1945, Misra 1969, Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2002a, 2002b, Last and Stevens 2009). This sawfish may be the most tolerant of cooler waters, and as such has the most pole-ward distribution of all of the sawfish, at least in the southern hemisphere. For example, in Australian waters this species historically occurred as far south as Sydney on the east coast, while the limits of other species are much farther north. The Red Sea and Persian (Arabian) Gulf are regions of presumed historic abundance (M. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012, A. Moore pers. comm. 2012, R. Jabado pers. comm. 2012), as is the northwest of Australia (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011). Its current occurrence in much of this range is uncertain due to a lack of reliable data, but it is presumed to have been extirpated from much of this area because of intensive inshore gillnet and trawl fisheries. <br/></p>","<p>The Green Sawfish is (or likely has been) utilised for its fins, flesh, rostrum (as a trophy, curio or in traditional medicine), liver, eggs and skin. The protection of this species in some range states (e.g., Australia, India) means that take is prohibited. The meat of sawfish is sometimes <span lang=""EN-GB"">utilised by Indigenous communities but the extent to which these communities harvest and <span lang=""EN-GB"">utilise Green Sawfish is unknown; however, it is likely localised and at a low rate. There are also anecdotal reports of Indigenous people purchasing sawfish rostra off commercial fishers, painting and then selling them (Stevens <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2005). There was a small trade of live animals for display in public aquaria prior to the species’ listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). <span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA"">See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.</span></span></p>",Marine,"Green Sawfish are fully protected in Australia by a variety of Federal (listed as Vulnerable, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) and State legislation (Queensland, Protected [Fisheries Act 1994]; Northern Territory, Vulnerable [Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000]; Western Australia, Totally Protected [Fish Resources Management Act 1994]; New South Wales, Presumed Extinct). There are also a variety of specific fisheries regulations and reporting requirements in most Australian fisheries that interact with Green Sawfish. Sawfish are also protected in a number of range states, including India, Bahrain and Qatar. Although protected in these range states, the lack of enforcement or specific fisheries regulations, and ongoing gillnet and trawl fisheries, means that threats are ongoing.<br/><br/>The Green Sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), prohibiting any international trade in the species. However, there is evidence that some Green Sawfish products (e.g., fins) remain in trade (M. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>The use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) is mandatory in some range states, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In an Australian study they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (<em>Anoxypristis cuspidata</em>), however they and other sawfish species are still vulnerable to capture as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Marine protected areas within range states may also provide significant conservation benefit to Green Sawfish. Within Australian waters, areas closed to fishing include ~30% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and some estuaries and inshore waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory and Western Australia. Temporal spawning closures for barramundi, the target species in inshore gillnet fisheries in northern Australia, also provide substantial protection (up to three months in some jurisdictions). In other range states, areas closed to fishing also occur. There are no closures specifically to address threats to Green Sawfish. The effectiveness of all areas closed to fishing throughout the range remain uncertain because of a lack of information about the movements of Green Sawfish.<br/><br/>Significant conservation benefits have been gained through education. In Australia, sawfish-specific handling guidelines have been developed and distributed to fishers in the form of printed material, videos and face-to-face training. This has aimed to maximise the survival of sawfish during release from fishing gear. Given the size and morphology of sawfish, releasing sawfish can be dangerous and historically they were often killed or de-sawed to make gear retrieval safer and easier. Thus development of handling guidelines (e.g., DEEDI 2010) may have significant benefit, and are also important for fisheries that operate in range states where they are fully protected (e.g., Australia). Conservation benefit may also be accrued from more general education of the public through display in public aquaria and through educational materials about sawfish such as outreach material provided to schools and other interested groups. However, to date such benefits have not been quantified. These activities increase awareness of the importance of these taxa and the conservation challenges that they face garnering public support for conservation actions.","",,false,false,Global

This species is caught in artisanal gillnet and longline and industrial trawl fisheries across its range. Gillnetting in the Gulf of California has been extensive and has led to the decline of various marine species. Shrimp trawling is prevalent in the southern Gulf of California, and this species has also been targeted there in artisanal fisheries since at least the 1960s. In Mexico, records of this species were relatively common from the 1950s to the 1980s, it became increasingly rare through the 1990s and early 2000s, and the last confirmed record is from 2001. Further south, intense and increasing artisanal fishing exists with very little management in place. Relative abundance decreased in the Colombian industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 1995 and 2004, which represented the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations (27 years).&#160;However, this species is still recorded in Pacific Colombian artisanal fisheries but with less frequency than in the past. Given its shallow depth range, this species has very little refuge from fishing. Overall, due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure  throughout its range, a lack of recent records in Mexico, and documented declines in Colombia, the Pacific Smalltail Shark&#160;is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of  more than 80% over the past three generations (27 years) based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","This requiem shark inhabits coastal areas and estuaries with muddy bottoms to 40 m depth (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2103, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 140 cm total length (TL); size- and age-at-maturity are unknown, but males are approaching maturity at 100 cm TL (Castro 2011). Reproduction is placental viviparous, but little else is known of its biology.&#160;Generation length is suspected to be about 9 years, close to that of the similarly-sized and closely-related Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Lessa and Santana 1998).","Pacific Smalltail Sharks are caught in trawl and artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries. Gillnets that often target sharks are prevalent in the Gulf of California and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and other marine life (Sala <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is a shrimp trawl fishery that likely interacts with this species in the southern Gulf of California, and management  issues such as overcapacity and declining catches have been cited in  that fishery (Foster and Vincent 2010). Fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s when it was among the most abundant sharks in catches (Kato 1965, Kato and Hernández-Carvallo 1967 cited in Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Further south in this species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place. Given its shallow depth range, this shark likely has little refuge from fishing.","In Pacific Mexico, this species was relatively common in ichthyological collections until the 1980s. There were very few records in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and there are no records since a 2001 fishing survey (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Targeted fisheries for sharks including this species off Mazatlan were in operation in the early 1960s, and this species was one of the most regularly caught sharks (Kato 1965, Kato and Hernández-Carvallo 1967 cited in Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). Intense artisanal gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California has led to declines in pelagic sharks (Sala&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004), and there is intense trawl pressure in parts of Mexico. Intense and unregulated artisanal fishing pressure exists in the southern portion of its range but little species information is available except for Colombia.&#160;<br/><br/>In Pacific Colombia, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of Pacific Smalltail Shark in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 1995 (0.24 individuals/hour) and 2004 (0.02 individuals/hour) (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016), the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations (27 years). There was also a decrease in the average size of individuals caught from 41 cm total length (TL) in 1995 to 38 cm TL in 2004 (Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016).

A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will  be required which will need to include species protection, spatial  management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest management, all of which  will be dependent on effective enforcement.

151858712,60181,Rhynchobatus cooki,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2019-05-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Clown Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus cooki</em>) is a small (to 81 cm total length) shark-like ray which is endemic to Southeast Asia. It has been recorded from fish landing sites in Singapore and Indonesia (Jakarta, Java) but its exact distribution is unknown as these market landings come from fisheries operating across the Indo-Malay Archipelago. Habitat and depth range are unknown, but wedgefishes are generally benthic in coastal and continental shelf waters. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity with small litter sizes; life history of the Clown Wedgefish is poorly known, but generation length is estimated as 10 years.&#160;The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Clown Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Clown Wedgefish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as&#160;four historical accounts and five contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while many of these datasets are outside the range of the Clown Wedgefish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific). It is inferred that the Clown Wedgefish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) with only a single known record in the last 23 years&#160;in a heavily fished and well surveyed area. The Clown Wedgefish is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd. Surveys are required to understand its contemporary occurrence and status. The apparent restricted distribution of the species increases its extinction risk.</p><p></p>","<p>Exact details of the habitat of the Clown Wedgefish are unknown as it has only been collected from fish markets. Wedgefishes (<em>Rhynchobatus&#160;</em>spp.) are generally benthic in coastal inshore waters of the continental shelf (Last<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016b), and it is likely that the habitat of the Clown Wedgefish is similar. This is a small species of wedgefish, reaching 81 cm total length (TL) (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016a), whereas other members of the genus can reach 310 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016b). Males &gt;70.5 cm TL are mature, while a 64 cm TL male was subadult; female size at maturity is unknown but a female 61 cm TL was immature; size at birth is unknown, embryos of 21 and 24 cm TL still had yolk sacs (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a). Reproductive mode is lecithotrophic viviparous, but no other details of life history are available.</p>","<p>Globally, wedgefishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Wedgefishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the distribution of the Clown Wedgefish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across its range (Pauly and Chuenpagdee 2003, Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996). Fishing pressure is high across the range of the Clown Wedgefish, for example Indonesia has ~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters (KKP 2016). Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of wedgefishes globally&#160;and the targeting of wedgefishes for their fins has also been reported in numerous countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Clown Wedgefish is landed throughout its range and Indonesia ranks as the top shark fishing nation globally (Lack and Sant 2011). Wedgefishes have been targeted in Indonesia since the 1970s, and these target fisheries have shifted spatially in response to localized depletions (Chen 1996, White and Dharmadi 2007, White and Sommerville 2010, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, W.T. White, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010) and&#160;Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>  <p>  </p><p></p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for wedgefish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues, particularly around the 'whitespotted wedgefish' (i.e.&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>) species-complex. The name&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus djiddensis</em>&#160;was used widely for wedgefishes across the Indo-West Pacific prior to clarification of species distributions and recognition that&#160;<em>R. djiddensis</em>&#160;is restricted to the Western Indian Ocean (see Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery).&#160;In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Four of the five contemporary datasets are outside the region of occurrence of the Clown Wedgefish but are informative for understanding population reduction in wedgefishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g. 'whitespotted wedgefish', 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of wedgefishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include wedgefishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in wedgefishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish (<em>Rhina ancylostoma</em>), Bottlenose Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus australiae</em>), Whitespotted Wedgefish (<em>R. djiddensis</em>), and Smoothnose Wedgefish (<em>R. laevis</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of an 81% population reduction over the last three generations of the smaller rhinid species (30 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 94-95% population reduction over the last three generations of the smaller rhinid species&#160;(30 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of an 86% population reduction over the last three generations of the smaller rhinid species&#160;(30 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Bowmouth Guitarfish and '<em>R. djiddensis</em>', and hence would therefore include Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, and Smoothnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 86% over this period. Furthermore, species-specific trawl landings data were reported for '<em>R. djiddensis'</em>&#160;(i.e. Bottlenose Wedgefish and Smoothnose Wedgefish), with a decline of 87% over this period. This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping likely includes Bowmouth Guitarfish, Bottlenose Wedgefish, Clown Wedgefish, Eyebrow Wedgefish <em>(R. palpebratus</em>), and Broadnose Wedgefish. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Clown Wedgefish&#160;(30 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while most of these datasets are outside the range of the Clown Wedgefish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Clown Wedgefish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd. Furthermore, there has only been a single record of the Clown Wedgefish in the last 23 years (an individual landed in Singapore in 2019; Naomi Clark-Shen and Kathy Xu, pers. comm., 26/05/2019).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Clown Wedgefish is known from specimens collected from fish markets in Singapore and Jakarta (Indonesia) in the Western Central Pacific (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016a).

While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens can sell for low value&#160;(e.g., Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018, R.W.

Two lines of evidence indicate a population reduction. First, in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, catch-per-unit-effort   (CPUE) declined by an estimated 54% between 1974 and 1981. Second, a 75% decline in  CPUE was estimated from 1994 to  1999 in Rio  Grande do Sul, Brazil. Both declines are consistent with a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generation lengths (48 years). This large skate has a slow life history, and many skates with similar characteristics have undergone  severe population reductions and face increased extinction risk. It is highly susceptible to exploitation  and does not have any refuge from fishing at depth. Overall, due to declining abundance from intense and largely unmanaged fishing through most of its range combined with its large  size and presumed late age-at-maturity (and therefore high  sensitivity to fishing pressure), it is suspected that the Spotback Skate&#160;has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over  the past three generation lengths (48 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","The Spotback Skate inhabits the continental shelf and upper slope from inshore to 300 m depth (J.M. Cuevas, unpubl. data 2018). It reaches a maximum size of 147 cm total length (TL); females mature at 106–114 cm TL and males at 91–100 cm TL (Oddone <em>et al.</em> 2008, Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2012, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is oviparous and females lay 9–12 egg cases between January and October, and young skates hatch at 17 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is estimated at about 16 years based on a female age-at-maturity of 10.6 years and a maximum age of 20.8 years (Hozbor and Massa 2013).","The Spotback Skate is captured in demersal trawl fisheries, which operate throughout its range (Casarini 2006, Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006, Orlando <em>et al.</em> 2011). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20 to 1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010 and half of those had collapsed (Vasconcellos<em> et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al. </em>2019). In  Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and  many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). The industrial fleet increased from 46 vessels in 1975 to a peak of 121 in 2004, followed by a decline to 81 vessels in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). During the expansion phase of this fishery, landings increased six-fold from 1975 to 1981. Subsequent depletion of these species led to a diversification of the fisheries into retaining non-traditional (i.e. bycatch) species, masking the decline in previous target species (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006). By 1992, there were over 300 coastal trawlers, and this number increased to over 400 by 2015. The number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). The  Spotback Skate was caught in 71% of trawl landings in the San Matías Gulf surveyed over a  two-year period from 2007 to 2009, however the majority of these individuals (88%)  were juveniles (Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). This skate is large and has a slow life history (Colonello <em>et al.</em> 2012), and many skates with similar characteristics have undergone severe population declines and face increased extinction risk (Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). These animals are highly susceptible to exploitation, are exposed to largely unmanaged fishing pressure across their range, and do not have any refuge at depth.","In Santa Catarina State, Brazil, a decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 54% was estimated between 1974 and 1981; similarly, a 75% decline in CPUE was estimated from 1994 to  1999 in Rio Grande do Sul (Ferreira <em>et al. </em>2010), both equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;99% if scaled over three generations (48 years). In the Uruguayan fisheries statistics for the coastal industrial trawler   fleet, this species is included in the generic category 'skates' which  refers  mostly to the Smallnose Fanskate (<em>Sympterygia bonapartii</em>),   therefore, there are no specific data for the Spotback Skate from that   fishery. This species was caught in 30% of Uruguayan research trawl surveys carried out between 2010 and 2016 in the Argentina-Uruguay   Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), making up 10% of the skate landings by weight. In 794 research trawls over that time frame, this skate was recorded in 224 hauls (Paesch 2018). In the Rio del Plata Estuary, the landings of coastal rays including this species was low until the mid-1990s, but increased retention led to substantial increases in landings which peaked in 2008, followed by a decline (Cortés <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Argentina, reported landings of skates in  general increased from 900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and  then declined to 24,000 t in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y  Pesca 2010, cited in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). Trawl landings data for rays &gt;90 cm total length in size from the Southwest Atlantic show a sharp increase in the 1990s and 2000s, from  less than 1,000 t to a peak of nearly 4,000 t in 2007. Landings then  declined to 1,000–1,500 t between 2008 and 2013 despite increased effort (Port <em>et al. </em>2016, FAO 2019), equivalent to a &gt;99% decline over three generations. Although these reported landings data are not  species-specific, they do suggest a substantial increase in fishing  pressure over the past several decades, and the recent decline in landings in some areas may represent a reduction in population size (although this needs to be confirmed with estimates of standardized CPUE and/or fisheries-independent research). Overall, due to declining indices of abundance in many areas, ongoing intense and unmanaged fishing through most of its range, and its large size and presumed late age-at-maturity (and therefore high susceptibility to fishing pressure), it is suspected that the Spotback Skate has undergone a population reduction of more than 80% over the past three generation lengths (48 years).",Decreasing,"The Spotback Skate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to San Matías Gulf in Chubut, Argentina (Cousseau <em>et al. </em>2000, Last<em> et al. </em>2016).","This skate is taken as utilized bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries and is sold locally and traded internationally to Asian markets (Dent and Clarke 2015, Silveira <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"This species is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the  Environment No. 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species  listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National  Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Oddone <em>et al.</em> 2018). This  legislation came into force in December 2014, however, it was  suspended for all of 2015 and the first half of 2016 due to pressure  from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017). The ordinance  faces increasing industry pressure, including a court challenge to  suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional de Aquicultura  e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that the Brazilian  National Red List was designed specifically for terrestrial species  (Spautz 2019). This species is included in the annual maximum permitted catch (MPC) of the Argentinian and Uruguayan fisheries for coastal skates in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone&#160;(CTMFM 2018). This measure is currently not likely to be an adequate management measure, because landings have been higher than the quotas. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement. Further research is needed on life history and population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring should be undertaken in trawl fisheries.","",,false,false,Global
152845178,60344,Anguilla anguilla,Critically Endangered,A2bd+4bd,2020,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> exhibits facultative catadromy (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000, Tesch 2003), has multiple life stages, and is semelparous (Tesch 2003) and is panmictic across a continental spatial scale (Als <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pujolar <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>b</em>); these life history traits and characteristics made application of the IUCN Red List criteria challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘North Sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70° W and eastward to 50° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): Min–Max, glass eels: 5.4–9.2, yellow: 6.9–133.0, silver (Male): 21.2–44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4–101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, Yalçın-Özdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (Dörner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2–15 years for males and 4–20 years for females (Tesch 2003) – noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment.

In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a ‘Barrier Atlas’ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958–2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under “new and emerging threats”, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (Ovegård 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960–70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000–3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the “North Sea” series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the “Elsewhere” series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and at 6.0% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the ‘North Sea’ index, and 8.9% in the ‘Elsewhere’ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960–1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960’s (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN Comité français, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for ‘Mature Individuals’ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in “pre-Convention” specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950–2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia – a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.” (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member States’ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulation’s success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for “trap and transport” (downriver transport), and “assisted migration” (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: “The status of European eel remains critical”, and that “all anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020” (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011–2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero. This highlights the necessity for continued, effective conservation across the range for <em>A. anguilla</em>.&#160;</p><p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is demersal on insular slopes at depths of 200–450 m. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the Philippines and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the China and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 54–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The species&#160;has a fairly restricted distribution and&#160;no refuge from fishing pressure. Swellsharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines. It is suspected that the Reticulated Swellshark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (45 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","The Reticulated Swellshark is demersal on insular slopes at depths of 200–400 m (Nakaya <em>et al</em>. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of at least 42.2 cm total length (TL) (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Males mature at ~36 cm TL and females mature at 42 cm TL (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013). Reproduction is oviparous. Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species,&#160;the&#160;Blacktip Sawtail Catshark&#160;(<em>Galeus sauteri</em>)&#160;that has a female age-at-maturity of 9.1 years and a maximum age of 20.9 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011).","<p>The&#160;Reticulated Swellshark&#160;is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. <br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter<em> et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante<em> et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm., 28/08/19, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm., 28/08/19). Bottom trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, deepwater dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp and&#160;<em>Squalus&#160;</em>spp) date back to the 1960s (Flores 2004, BFAR 2017). These fisheries are poorly documented. In&#160;Cagayancillo, Palawan, Philippines, there are ~28 vessels in operation, setting demersal longlines to depths between 700–1,400 m (usually 800–1,000 m) (LAMAVE&#160;2017). These deepwater fisheries are known for their boom-and-bust nature, given the lack of management, and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). <br/><br/>Future development in the region, such as the&#160;'nine-dash line' area is claimed by China and&#160;the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, may enable increased fishing pressure&#160;and habitat degradation through dredging and land creation activities (Mora&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","There are no species-specific time series, but there are shark landings data and reconstructed sharks, rays, and skates landings data available from the region. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;In Taiwan, the landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm. 28/08/2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019, Liao<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang, pers. comm., 28/08/19), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, municipal and industrial shark fisheries production peaked around 1990 (19,049 mt reported collectively); between 1996–2005, municipal fisheries declined at a rate of ~50% and between 1997–2006,&#160;industrial&#160;fisheries declined ~90% (BFAR 2017).&#160;Annual exports of shark liver oil peaked at 336 t in 1980 to 45 t in 1993 (BFAR 2017).&#160;In Viet Nam, the reconstructed catch data of sharks, rays, and skates showed an 88% decline in landings from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). There were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<br/><br/>When declines in Taiwan, China, Philippines, and Viet Nam are scaled to three generation lengths (45 years), they represent declines of 90%, 54%, &gt;99%, and 96%, respectively. While these levels of declines are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.&#160;Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Reticulated Swellshark. The species&#160;has a fairly restricted distribution and&#160;no refuge from fishing pressure. Swellsharks are very sensitive to fishing pressure; even when fisheries management is implemented, intensive fishing can lead to significant declines (see the Whitefin Swellshark <em>C. albipinnum</em>, Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2019). Overall, a population&#160;reduction of &gt;80% was suspected over the last three generation lengths (45 years), based on levels of exploitation.

The meat is consumed locally and exported, the offal is used for fish meal, and the skins are processed into leather. Across the species’ entire range, there is a long history of overfishing inshore marine resources and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of sharks, rays, and skates from the Bangladesh, Indian, and Pakistan Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) indicate declines of 78–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) of the Shorttail Whipray.

It is suspected that the Shorttail Whipray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","The Shorttail Whipray is benthic on muddy substrates in inshore waters from the surface to a depth of 100 m, although usually shallower than 50 m (Last et al. 2016, Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2016, K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of at least 66 cm disc width (DW), size-at-maturity is unknown; males were not mature by 51 cm DW (Last et al. 2016, Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a size-at birth of ~15–17 cm DW (Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2016). As there is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, generation length was inferred as 20 years based on data for the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). As the Blackspotted Whipray attains a larger maximum size (80 cm DW) than the Shorttail Whipray (66 cm DW), generation length was scaled to 15 years.","This species is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, longlines, gillnets, and demersal set nets. In Bangladesh, there is a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018, there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km in length) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Industrial fisheries contribute ~6% of the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each fishing vessel is equipped with different gears and many carry demersal set longline gear to mainly target rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many fishing vessels in the southwest and south central regions of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term and this period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In India, this species is caught in trawls and gillnets at depths of 5–40 m. It is not commonly landed, and only 62 individuals were observed in landings on the east coast market during 2018–2019 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The inshore depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (two generation lengths). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen et al. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Sri Lanka, coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished as the coastal sector was reported to have limited capacity for further expansion. This resulted in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Southeast Asia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Southeast Asia the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There are no species-specific population trend data. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landings data from 1950 to 2016 are available on all sharks, rays, and skates from fisheries within the Bangladesh, Indian, and Pakistan Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, elasmobranch catch increased from the 1950s to a peak in 2000 at 10,910 t (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches have since been reduced to 6,089 t in 2016. This represents a decline of 81% when scaled to three generation lengths (45 years) of the Shorttail Whipray. This is likely an underestimate of the population decline of the Shorttail Whipray as it occurs inshore and is easily accessible, thus it has been exposed to a higher level of fishing pressure than most elasmobranchs. In Bangladesh, anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in all rays over the past ten years (Ullah et al. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly et al. 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large individual rays. This large decline in ray catches has led to fishers using other net types (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In India, reconstructed elasmobranch catch has varied between 50,000 and 85,000 t from 1970 to 2000. Catch has since decreased to ~47,500 t from 2005 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). This represents a decline of at least 78% when scaled to three generation lengths (45 years) of the Shorttail Whipray. The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990 and 2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, reconstructed elasmobranch catch peaked in 2007 at over 400 t and has since declined to ~21 t in 2016 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). This represents a decline of 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (45 years) of the Shorttail Whipray. In Sri Lanka, reconstructed landings have increased 3-fold from 150,000 t in 1950 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Elasmobranch declines across the species' range infer population reductions of 78–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) of the Shorttail Whipray. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Shorttail Whipray, and it has no refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is suspected that the Shorttail Whipray has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Shorttail Whipray is endemic to the northern Indian Ocean with a patchy distribution in Pakistan, India, northern Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, A.B. Haque and K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).","This species is used for its meat which is sold fresh or dried and salted (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, larger rays are desirable for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and sometimes exported while the skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags) and sometimes for human consumption (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Smaller rays, including juveniles of this species, are retained for their meat, but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been an increase in the demand of ray meat in coastal and cosmopolitan areas and anecdotal evidence suggests for consumption in some restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020), and the skin of whiprays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 6 February 2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India. In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia, although this is becoming extremely rare for this species. The offal is used in production of fish meal for poultry (M. Khan pers. comm. 28 October 2020).<br/><p></p>",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could provide some refuge for this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). India and Pakistan have a seasonal trawl ban for two months each year that might benefit this species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries during that period (e.g. gillnetting). To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

The few animals occasionally captured in the wild are probably from aquaculture origin and were probably released in the last few years. However, there is a slim chance that wild individuals still exist. The population on the eastern Adriatic are also probably extinct in the  wild, there is no evidence of natural reproduction since 1990 in  Albania. However, there also is a slim chance that wild individuals still  exist there.<br/><br/>The species is assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) under criterion A2, on the basis of an estimated population decline of greater than 80% (possibly 100%) in the past three generations (60 years). This population decline is based on a decline in the extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and catch data, and was caused by over-harvesting (both legal and illegal), loss of access to spawning grounds (dams), and pollution (industrial and agricultural).<br/><br/>The remaining potential suitable spawning grounds are restricted to very few areas in the Po River with an AOO of less than 10 km² (one location). There may still be some wild individuals left, but it is unknown how many there may be; potentially there are less than 250. Without continuous re-stocking the survival of this species is doubtful as continued successful reproduction in the wild can no longer be confirmed.<br/><br/>For the EU 27 region, the species is also assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (CR(PE) A2bcde;B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)).","The Adriatic Sturgeon lives in large rivers where, in the past, reproduction occurred from May to July. It is a long-lived, anadromous species, living mainly in the rivers. It spawns in freshwater after a marine period of growth during which it remains near the shore (at the mouths of the rivers) at a depth of 10–40 m. The upstream migration into Italian rivers occurs during the first months of the year (Paccagnella 1948, D'Ancona 1924). It occurs over sandy or muddy bottoms. The only remaining suitable spawning areas for this species are at the confluence between the Po River and its tributaries (Adda, Ticino etc).","Overfishing (both legal and illegal), and in particular of pre-reproductive sized fish, threatens this species. It is also threatened by the creation of barriers to its migratory routes, which reduce its reproductive success; and fragmentation of populations, particularly by dams for hydropower on the Po River (Isola Serafini's Dam, Piacenza).

203375487,203364219,Dipturus batis,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2021,2021-04-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Common Blue Skate (<em>Dipturus batis</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 143 cm total length) skate that was once an abundant constituent of the demersal fish community of northwestern Europe. The species is currently known to extend from Iceland, the Rockall Bank and the western Isles of Scotland in the north, the shelf edge, and to the Celtic Sea and to the Bay of Biscay in the south, at depths of 10–600 m. The southern limits and presence in Iberian waters are uncertain. It now appears to be virtually absent from much of the shallower parts of this range and is localised only in areas of the Celtic Sea, the continental shelf edge west of Ireland and the Rockall Bank. The Common Blue Skate may have formerly occupied shelf and slope areas of much of the Northeastern Atlantic, from Norway to North Africa as far as Morocco, but due to unconfirmed taxonomy this part of its historical geographic range remains uncertain. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in multispecies trawl and tangle net fisheries, which cover much of its shelf and upper slope habitat. Fisheries data indicate that populations of the 'common skate complex' comprised of (Common Blue Skate and Flapper Skate, <em>D. intermedius</em>) underwent an extremely high level of depletion in the central part of their range around the British Isles and Ireland since the early 20th century (within the suspected three generation period of 60 years). Fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Accurate international species-specific landings data are lacking, although reported Icelandic landings of the 'common skate complex' have declined. The life history and demography of Common Blue Skate allow limited capacity to withstand exploitation by fisheries; its large body size renders it catchable by fishing gears even from birth. This has been a prohibited species since 2009 in parts of its range and cannot be landed in European Union or United Kingdom waters. Prior to 2009, there was an inferred steep decline of the Common Blue Skate in fisheries landings and an observed, but unquantified, reduction in geographic range size. It is suspected that the Common Blue Skate has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation and range reduction, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","The Common Blue Skate is demersal in shallow coastal waters at depths of 10–600 m in continental shelf slope habitats and deep offshore seamounts/banks, although it is primarily within the 200 m depth range (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Weigmann 2016). This is a large species of skate and reaches a maximum size of at least 143 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~115 cm TL and females mature at 123 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is oviparous with ~40 egg-cases deposited annually and size-at-birth of 21–22 cm TL (Clark 1922, 1926; Ebert and Dando 2021). The age and growth of the ‘common skate complex’ was reported by Du Buit (1976) and more recently by Fahy (1991) who examined the vertebrae of 75 individuals landed in Ireland. Using the age-at-length relationship determined for the ‘common skate complex’ (Du Buit 1976), the age at 50% maturity is tentatively suggested as 11 years for Common Blue Skate and maximum age is estimated as 30 years. Thus, generation length is estimated as 20 years.","The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles of this species makes it especially vulnerable to over-exploitation when compared to other skates (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Skates are an important component of the demersal fisheries of northwest Europe (Holden 1977) and Common Blue Skate has traditionally been landed due to its large size (Ellis et al. 2010). It has been caught in targeted fisheries where and when abundant, and as a bycatch elsewhere within its range. Given that this species is likely to be caught in trawl, gillnet, and tangle net fisheries that target high-value teleosts (e.g., anglerfish (Lophiiformes spp.) and hake (Merlucciidae spp.)), it is unlikely that fishing effort will decrease. However, given that there are positive trends in multiple fishery-independent trawl surveys since the ‘common skate complex’ were listed as prohibited species on European Union fisheries regulations, it is possible that the current levels of fishing pressure are allowing population growth.<br/><br/>Worldwide capture production reported as ‘<em>D. batis</em>’, was 502 t in 2005, of which 302 t (60.2%) were landed by France (Iglésias <em>et al</em>. 2010). Given the issues of the identification of members of this family, landings of Common Blue Skate can be erroneously reported as Flapper Skate, Long-nosed Skate, and Norwegian Skate, which hampers the interpretation of landings data, which may also vary with spatio-temporal changes in fishing patterns. Reported landings of 'common skate complex' from United Kingdom waters decreased between 2002 and 2010, in line with the introduction of management measures in 2009 (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012). Most recreational anglers in the United Kingdom and Ireland return 'common skate complex' individuals they catch alive. Some angling clubs and most charter boats tag and release 'common skate complex' when caught.","Mitochondrial genetic data suggest that this is a species complex with distinct population segments that may correspond to subpopulations (G.J.P. Naylor pers. comm. 29 April 2021). The Common Blue Skate, as the name implies, was historically one of the most abundant skates and rays in the Northeast Atlantic. It was widely distributed in the seas surrounding the British Isles. For example, in the late 19th Century it was described as very common in inshore areas of the western English Channel, and at least as common as smaller Raja species (Heape 1887). Fishing capacity and effort increased substantially over the later half of the 20th century. Catch rates of Common Blue Skate in western English Channel declined during the 20th century; by the 1920s, it was uncommon in inshore areas of the western English Channel and by the 1970s, the ‘common skate complex’ was considered to be close to locally extinct from the Irish Sea (Brander 1981, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2002). Taxonomic confusion between the Common Blue Skate and Flapper Skate, and with other members of the genus, means that the declines in abundance and distribution of the two species that occurred during the 20th and early 21st centuries are difficult to assign to a species.<br/><br/>The ‘common skate complex’ also disappeared from the English Channel and the southern and central North Sea (Walker 1999, Rogers and Ellis 2000, Sguotti et al. 2016) with only occasional specimens reported (e.g., Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the North Sea, the ‘common skate complex’ is now mainly encountered in the northernmost part and is composed of the Flapper Skate (ICES 2012). There have been very occasional captures of Common Blue Skate by commercial trawlers in the southern North Sea in recent years (J.R. Ellis unpubl. obs. 2021), but such captures are infrequent and indicate that the species is still depleted in this area of former habitat. Common Blue Skate is the main species of the ‘common skate complex’ in the Celtic Sea, with catch ratios of Common Blue Skate to Flapper skate of approximately 150:1 (ICES 2012) and is also the more abundant of the two species on the Rockall Bank, whilst Flapper Skate is more common in the shelf seas of both western and eastern Scotland.<br/><br/>Accurate species-specific landings data are not available, though earlier species-specific data from Iceland indicate declining landings of the 'common skate complex'. Recent fishery-independent trawl surveys have shown positive signals in either catch rates and/or occurrence of Common Blue Skate (ICES 2020a,b), including the surveys from off northwestern Scotland, around the Porcupine Bank and in the Celtic Sea, although these data typically cover limited time frames.<br/><br/>Current levels of exploitation across the Celtic Seas and waters west of Scotland, where Common Blue Skate is known to occur, are not precisely known. Whilst the earlier decline indicates that fishing pressure was too high, there is the indication of improving status in recent years, following the prohibition on landing the ‘common skate complex’. Overall, a population reduction of &gt; 80% is suspected to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (~60 years) due to earlier levels of exploitation and a reduction in its range.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland and Scandinavia to the Bay of Biscay, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and coasts of northwest Europe, including up to the Scandinavian Peninsula and into the Skagerrak and Kattegat (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, ICES 2012, Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Bom <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Zidowitz unpubl. data 2021). The distributions of the two species in the ‘common skate complex’ are not precisely known, but available data indicate a large region of overlap from northern Scotland to the Celtic Sea, including west of Ireland (Griffiths et al. 2010, ICES 2012). Whilst initial studies of thermal preferences suggested Common Blue Skate may be the more southerly species of the ‘common skate complex’ (Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2010), Common Blue Skate has been the member of the complex reported occurring in Icelandic waters (ICES 2012). Whilst ‘common skate complex’ has also been reported in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea, as far east as the Murman coast (Andriyashev 1954, Williams 2008), it is uncertain whether these records refer to Common Blue Skate and/or Flapper Skate, or another skate species (e.g., another <em>Dipturus </em>spp. or <em>Bathyraja</em> spp.). The southern distributional limits, including its presence off Spain and Portugal, are uncertain and, whilst reported originally from Iberian waters (e.g., Nobre 1935), it is usually the Long-nosed Skate (<em>D. oxyrinchus</em>) being the member of the genus more often reported there (Figueiredo <em>et al</em>. 2007). Whilst also previously being considered to occur in the western Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea (Serena 2005), the historical occurrence of the species in that area is now uncertain (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2020), with recent studies (e.g., Cariani <em>et al</em>. 2017) only confirming the presence of the congeners Long-nosed Skate and Norwegian Skate (<em>D. nidarosiensis</em>).","The species is used for human consumption, and although current management measures in the European Union and United Kingdom waters (the main parts of the population area) prohibit the retention of the species, it may be caught and retained elsewhere in its range.",Marine,"European fishing vessels (and other vessels fishing in EU waters) have not been allowed to land the 'common skate complex' from Union waters of ICES Divisions 2.a and 3.a, or from Subareas 4, 6-9 since 2009.

203720849,63128,Mustelus mento,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2021,2019-02-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Speckled Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus mento</em>) is a small (to 141 cm total length) houndshark that occurs in the Southeast Pacific from Mancora, Peru south to the austral  tip of Chile, and is also found in the Galápagos and Juan Fernandez  Islands; its presence is uncertain in Argentina. Most of this shark's distribution is in southern Peru and northern Chile. It is demersal on the continental and insular shelves at depths of 16–50 m. It is heavily exploited throughout its range and captured mainly by artisanal gillnet fisheries in Peru and Chile, and is occasionally landed in industrial trawl fisheries in Chile. In Peru, catches of this species are effectively unregulated and the true catch is masked in the aggregate product category of 'tollo'. Historically, in Peru, landings of tollo were high for a 24-year period  between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak  of 25,000 t in 1984. Over the period 1990–2004, there was a  substantial drop in landings to an average of 4,806 t, equivalent to  91.6% reduction over three generation lengths. In Chile, population reduction can be inferred from species-specific landing records beginning with small catches in 1960 peaking at 419 tons in 1989 followed by collapse. Landings declined by more than 90% between 1990–2018 (approximately three generations) to the point where this shark has not been reported from northern Chilean artisanal fisheries in recent years. Given the very steep declines in tollo landings in Peru, combined with the collapse in landings of this species in northern Chile, and actual or potential levels of exploitation, it is inferred that the Speckled Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generations (30 years), and it is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Speckled Smoothhound is demersal on the continental and insular shelves at depths of 16–50 m (Ebert <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of 141 cm total length (TL) (X. Vélez-Zuazo unpubl. data 2019), males mature at 65–76 cm TL, females at 86–90 cm TL, and size-at-birth is about 30 cm TL (Compagno&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Lamilla <em>et al. </em>2005, Ebert&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, and females give birth to seven young per litter (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be about 10 years as this species is intermediate in size in comparison to other&#160;<em>Mustelus</em>&#160;species, which range from 5.8 years in&#160;<em>M. californicus</em>&#160;to 18 years in&#160;<em>M. mustelus</em>&#160;(Goosen and Smale 1997, Yudin and Cailliet 1990).","<p>This houndshark is captured mainly by artisanal gillnet fisheries and occasional landings from industrial trawl fisheries, particularly in Chile. Peruvian catches of this species are probably small compared to those for the Humpback Smoothhound (<em>M. whitneyi</em>) because the abundance of the Speckled Smoothound increases towards southern Peru. The bulk of this species' distribution occurs in northern Chile. The highest catches of tollo are taken in the south, mainly by coastal artisanal gillnet fisheries with occasional landings to this category from industrial vessels (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2005a, Lamilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005b; J. Lamilla unpubl. data). However, inferring population trajectory from the bulk of these unsorted landings in Chile is challenging, both because of the reduction in effort and the mixed species composition of this product (which varies with latitude).<br/><br/>First, tollo landings in Chile peaked at about 1,300 t in 1989 and have since declined steadily to 200 t or less since 1995. However, this decline in landings may not be indicative of a steep population decline as effort in the tollo gillnet fishery may have increased during the late 1980s because of transfer of effort from the hake fishery, which then declined during the early 1990s as effort shifted to the ray fishery (E. Acuña pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Second, in Chile, occasional large artisanal landings attributed to this species may be composed of the other shark species, including Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>) and Tope (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>). Catches of Spiny Dogfish taken in the artisanal fisheries in the south (41 degrees) are driving peaks in the landings of tollo. Taken together, the fluctuations in these landings are largely explained by variation in fishing effort, and the dominance of landings by Spiny Dogfish and Tope mean that these do not provide a good index of population size in Chile. However, there are species-specific landings data that suggest a 98% decline in landings since the peak in 1979 (C. Bustamante unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, this houndshark is exposed to multiple inadequately managed fisheries, it has no refuge at depth, there has been a steep decline in landings since 1979, and fisheries pressure is increasing. <br/></p>","<p>There are no population size estimates for this shark. Historically, the bulk of the catches were taken in northern Chile with smaller catches of this species in southern Peru. In Chile, population reduction can be inferred from landings records that started in 1960 (as a separate landing category from 'cazón', or Tope <em></em>(<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>)). Historical records reveal well-marked periods of low catch then peaking in 1979 followed by collapse. During the first period between 1960–1974 there were small, stable catches averaging 210 tonnes per year, with a maximum of 293 tonnes in 1972. Landings decreased slightly during 1975–1978, averaging 51 tons annually. This shark was fully exploited from 1979, with landings peaking at 419 tons in 1989 followed by collapse. Landings have decreased over the last 40 years without any signs of recovery; landings have been reduced by up to 90% between 1990–2018, or about three generation lengths (C. Bustamante unpubl. data 2020). In the bulk of this species' range, in northern Chile, it has been depleted&#160;and has only been occasionally reported from artisanal fisheries over the past ten years 2009–2019&#160;(C. Bustamante pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/>Historically, in Peru, landings of 'tollo' were high for a 24-year period  between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak  of 25,000 t in 1984 (FAO 2006). Over the period 1990–2004, there was a  substantial drop in landings to an average of 4,806 t, equivalent to  a 91.6% reduction over three generation lengths. The most recent landings data for Peru shows halving in catch reported in the aggregate tollo category within 15 years (1.5 generation lengths). Specifically, there a continued decline of landings from approximately 200 t to approximately 100 t over the recent period 1997–2012&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). <br/><br/>Overall, the combination of very steep declines in tollo landings in Peru, the uncertain species composition of this mixed category, and the documented collapse in landings of this species in northern Chile despite increased effort, lead to inference of a population reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (30 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Speckled Smoothhound&#160;occurs in the Southeast Pacific from Mancora, Peru south to the austral tip of Chile, and is also found in the Galápagos (Ecuador) and Juan Fernandez (Chile) Islands (Chirichigno and Cornejo 2001, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).

Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Widenose Guitarfish is inferred&#160;from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia (and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Widenose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific).

Moazzam pers. comm, 07/02/2019). Generation length is estimated as 10 years (see the Supplementary Information).","<em><em></em></em>  <p>Globally, giant guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Giant guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat and fins (Bonfil and Abdallah 2004, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Widenose Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010),&#160;and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Pakistan (2,000 trawlers), Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004), and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Widenose Guitarfish is landed throughout its range and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka&#160;(Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). Southeast Asia for example, has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g., the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e. datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Three of the four historical accounts, and one of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Widenose Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g., 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) and Halavi Guitarfish (<em>G.</em>&#160;<em>halavi</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of an 81% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish. Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 94-95% population reduction over the last three generations of the Widenose Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of an 86% population reduction over the last three generations of the Widenose Guitarfish (30 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (<em>G. typus</em>) and Clubnose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Landings declined by 86% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of smaller glaucostegid species (30 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Widenose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Widenose Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,The Widenose Guitarfish is moderately widespread in the northern Indian Ocean from Pakistan to the Gulf of Thailand (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).,"<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.

The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W.

Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, providing refuge from that fishing method.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Clubnose Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example (just outside the range of the Clubnose Guitarfish), the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g., as reported in 2010: Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010), and most countries have significant fishing fleets operating in coastal waters e.g. Sri Lanka (24,600 gillnet vessels operating in 2004) and Indonesia (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (Dissanayake 2005, CMFRI 2010, KKP 2016, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including giant guitarfishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish&#160;species in the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the high value of fins is driving retention and trade of giant guitarfishes globally (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). The Clubnose Guitarfish is landed throughout its range (e.g., White and Dharmadi 2007, Last <em>et al.</em> 2010) and several countries within the distribution of this species rank among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally, specifically Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka&#160;(Lack and Sant 2011). <br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore 2017). Southeast Asia for example, has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>Where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for giant guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion e.g. the Aru Islands gillnet fishery). In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). To infer population reduction for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes, four relevant historical accounts are presented below, followed by five more contemporary datasets on landings and catch rates (i.e., datasets including some period of the 2000s) (see the Supplementary Information for details). For the five contemporary datasets, there is no information to suggest that overall effort would have decreased such that declining catches represent changes in the fishery. Rather, they likely indicate reductions in abundance. Two of the five contemporary datasets are outside the known range of the Clubnose Guitarfish, but are informative for understanding population reduction in giant guitarfishes more broadly.<br/><br/>With regards to historic perspectives, firstly, research trawl survey data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 93% decline in catch rates of 'Rhinobathidae' (a name that is likely to include wedgefishes and guitarfishes broadly) from peak catches in 1968 to a low in 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979). Similarly, catch rates of 'rays' declined by 92% from 1963 to 1972. Secondly, the Indonesian Aru Islands wedgefish gillnet fishery rapidly expanded from its beginnings in the mid-1970s to reach its peak in 1987 with more than 500 boats operating before catches then declined very rapidly with only 100 boats left fishing in this area in 1996 (Chen 1996) (it is suspected that this fishery caught giant guitarfishes as well as wedgefishes). Thirdly, investors in Indonesia withdrew from a wedgefish fishery in the Malaku and Arafura Seas because the resource had been overfished by 1992 resulting in limited returns for their investment (Suzuki 2002). Lastly, research trawl surveys in the Java Sea showed the decline of 'rays' between 1976 and 1997 by 'at least an order of magnitude' (i.e., a decline of at least 90%) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Five contemporary datasets are available for landings data or catch rates at varying levels of taxonomic resolution (e.g. 'guitarfishes' etc.) from Iran, Pakistan, western and eastern India, and Indonesia. These datasets likely include various species of giant guitarfishes and in each case probable species are listed.&#160;One dataset (Raje and Zacharia 2009) does not include giant guitarfishes but rather presents landings data for myliobatoid rays (stingrays, eagle rays, butterfly rays, and devil rays). However, this can be used to infer declines in giant guitarfishes given overlapping distributions, habitat, and susceptibility to capture in the same fishing gear. Data used to calculate proportional declines, annual proportional change, and population reduction over three generation lengths are provided in the Supplementary Information.<br/><br/>Firstly, landings data for the 'giant guitarfish' category are available from Iran for 1997-2016 (20 years; Table 2 in the Supplementary Information) (FAO 2018). This grouping likely includes all rhinids and glaucostegids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish (<em>Glaucostegus granulatus</em>) and Halavi Guitarfish (<em>G.</em>&#160;<em>halavi</em>). Landings declined by 66% over this period, which is the equivalent of a 91% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Secondly, landings data for the 'rhinobatid' category are available from Pakistan for 1993-2011 (19 years; Tables 3 and 4 in the Supplementary Information) covering the country’s two coastal provinces (M. Gore unpubl. data). This grouping likely includes all rhinids, glaucostegids, and rhinobatids occurring locally, including Sharpnose Guitarfish, Halavi Guitarfish, and Widenose Guitarfish (<em>G. thouin</em>). Data from Sindh province (Table 3) showed a 72% decrease from peak landings in 1999 to a low in 2011, and data from Balochistan province (Table 4) showed an 81% decrease from landings in 1994 to a low in 2011. These decreases are the equivalent of 98–99% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Thirdly, catch data for myliobatoid rays (this includes a variety of demersal rays, but does not include rhinopristoids) are available from Maharashtra, western India for 1990-2004 (15 years; Table 5 in the Supplementary Information) (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The catch rate declined by 63% over this period, while fishing effort doubled, which is the equivalent of a 95% population reduction over the last three generations of larger glaucostegid species (45 years).<br/><br/>Fourthly, landings data for 'guitarfishes' are available from Tamil Nadu, eastern India for 2002-2006 (5 years; Table 6 in the Supplementary Information) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). This grouping was reported in the paper to include Sharpnose Guitarfish and Widenose Guitarfish but was also likely to include Giant Guitarfish (<em>G. typus</em>) and Clubnose Guitarfish. Landings declined by 86% over this period.&#160;This time-period is too short to derive equivalent population reduction over three generations.<br/><br/>Lastly, landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005-2015 (11 years; Table 7 in the Supplementary Information) (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of glaucostegids as well as rhinids. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations of the Clubnose Guitarfish (45 years). An additional data point available for 2016 is excluded from this analysis. This datum suggests a massive increase in reported landings which is an artefact of the inclusion of a wider range of batoids in the reported figure (DGCF 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the range of this species (see Threats section), and while some of these datasets are outside the range of the Clubnose Guitarfish, they can be considered representative of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific (with the exception of some parts of Australasia). Overall, it is inferred that the Clubnose Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Clubnose Guitarfish has a moderately widespread distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from India to Borneo (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Some references also list it as occurring in the Red Sea (e.g. Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b), but these records are unclear and require verification (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017).","<p><a name=""_Hlk522539384"">Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins. While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally. The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore&#160;2017, Jabado 2018). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017).&#160;Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;</a>The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The eggs of shark-like rays are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data), and the snout of giant guitarfishes are considered a delicacy in Singapore where they are steamed and the gelatinous filling consumed.</p>",Marine,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">  </p><p>There are limited species-specific conservation or management measures in place for giant guitarfishes, and there are few measures across the range of the Clubnose Guitarfish that would benefit it. Malaysia has banned trawling in inshore waters, providing refuge from that fishing method.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring, including in artisanal fisheries, is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global
