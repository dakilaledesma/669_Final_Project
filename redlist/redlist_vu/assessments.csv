500969,11200,Lamna nasus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) is a large (to 357 cm total length) pelagic shark with an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North  Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters to depths of 1,809 m. There are two separate subpopulations, the North Atlantic  and the Southern Hemisphere. The species has low biological productivity with small litters, late age-at-maturity, and a shorter life span of 26 years in the North Atlantic compared to 60 years in the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the species is targeted and caught incidentally in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, as well as by rod and reel, and is often retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep declines have occurred in the North Atlantic; with declines also evident, though not as steep, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic  subpopulation reduction was 50–79% over three generations (58.5 years)  and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was &lt;20%  over three generations (114.9 years). The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with a 41.5% probability of &lt;20% reduction and 45.5% probability of &gt;30% reduction over three generations. Expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate that globally,  the reduction  is 30–49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore,  the  Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Porbeagle occurs inshore and over continental shelves, shelf edges, offshore banks, and in the open ocean to depths of 1,809 m (Francis <em>et al. </em>2008, Reyes and Torres-Florez 2009, Weigmann 2016). It prefers cold, temperate waters below 18°C (Campana and Joyce 2004, Francis <em>et al. </em>2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009). It reaches a maximum size of 357 cm total length (TL), though maximum size is likely larger in the North Atlantic as individuals &gt;230 cm TL are rare in the Southwest Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Males mature at 140–165 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 155–177 cm TL in the North Atlantic, females mature at about 170–195 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 200–219 cm TL in the North Atlantic (Jensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Natanson<em> et al. </em>2002, Francis and Duffy 2005, Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Forselledo 2012). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and oophagous with litters of 1–5 (usually 4), with a 8–9 month gestation period, an annual, but possibly biennial, reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 68–78 cm TL (Francis and Stevens  2000, Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Regional differences in bomb radiocarbon validated age estimates are apparent from the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Pacific. Female age at maturity is 13 and 16.5 years and maximum age is 26 and 60 years; generation length is therefore 19.5 and 38.3 years, respectively (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2002, Francis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Francis 2015). Population growth rate is low but is countered by high juvenile survival rates to produce an overall moderate population growth rate in the North Atlantic of 0.052–0.081 (Dulvy <em>et al. </em>2008, Cortés <em>et al. 2</em>015).","<p>The Porbeagle is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of large-scale pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as on rod on reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Northeast Atlantic stock has the longest history of commercial exploitation with the highest catches during the 1930s and 1950s (ICCAT 2010).<br/></p>  <p>Porbeagles are often retained for their meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), although fishing and/or retention is prohibited in some areas<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The post-release mortality on commercial longlines has been reported as 10–75%&#160;(Campana <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;</p>","There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Porbeagle. Genetic data support two separate subpopulations of the Porbeagle, the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere (Kitamura and Matsunaga 2010, Testerman 2014). No genetic structure was found within the North Atlantic or Southern Hemisphere subpopulations (Testerman 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four stock assessments: (1) Northwest Atlantic (ICCAT 2010); (2) Canadian Northwest Atlantic (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2013); (3) Northeast Atlantic (ICCAT 2010); and, (4) Southern Hemisphere risk assessment (Hoyle <em>et al. </em>2017). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, the Northwest Atlantic stock assessment bycatch surplus production (BSP) model indicated that in 2009 the biomass was 37% of that in 1961, but that with the currently low fishing mortality and an apparent increase in biomass in recent years, the stock is slowly recovering, although recovery could take decades due to the low productivity of Porbeagle (ICCAT 2010). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1961–2009 (49 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with a median reduction of 65.2% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the Canadian Northwest Atlantic stock assessment age-structured model indicated that the 2009 biomass was 22–27% of that in 1962, but that in recent years reduced quotas have halted the decline and the number of mature females is increasing (Campana <em>et al. </em>2013, Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2016). The trend analysis of the Canadian biomass for 1962–2009 (48 years)  revealed steep annual rates of reduction of 4.2%, consistent with a median reduction of 90.7% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the  highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Both Northwest Atlantic stock assessments have led to the conclusion that the Porbeagle stock is overfished but overfishing is currently not occurring (SCRS 2014, Curtis <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><br/> Third, the Northeast Atlantic stock assessment estimated that the 2009 biomass was 6% of unexploited biomass, although this estimate is uncertain, and that the stock is overfished but overfishing is not occurring (ICCAT 2010). Since 2010, the Total Allowable Catch in the Northeast Atlantic has been set to zero and since converted to a prohibition, to help the stock recover (SCRS 2014). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1926–2009 (84 years)  revealed annual rates of reduction  of 1.8%, consistent with a median reduction  of 56.5% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the  highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the risk assessment model of the Southern Hemisphere population indicated that fishing mortality is low, decreasing eastward from South Africa to New Zealand, and that there is a very low risk the population is subject to overfishing (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catch rate indicators showed stable or increasing catches across most of the Southern Hemisphere (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2017). The trend analysis of the modeled relative abundance for 1962–2015 (54 years) revealed modest annual rates of reduction  of 0.2%, consistent with a median reduction of 19.9% over three generation lengths (114.9 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. <br/><br/>Across both subpopulations, the Porbeagle was estimated to have  strongly declined in the North Atlantic and to have declined, but to a  far less degree, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic  subpopulation reduction was 50–79% over three generations (58.5 years) and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was &lt;20%  over three generations (114.9 years). To estimate a global  population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for  each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region;  the two sources of Northwest Atlantic data were used to generate two  global trends. The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with  the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generations.  However, this global trend was strongly influenced by the Southern Hemisphere trend, as this accounts for a larger proportion of the global distribution. E<span lang=""EN-US"">xpert judgement&#160;elicitation&#160;was used to estimate that globally, the reduction  is 30–49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore, the  Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Porbeagle has an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Porbeagles do not occur in the North Pacific, where they are replaced by the congener, the Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) (Francis <em>et al. </em>2008).","<p>The Porbeagle is used for its fins, liver oil, and high-quality meat (Francis <em>et al.</em> 2008, Hernandez <em>et al.</em> 2008). Together with the Salmon Shark, the two species accounted for 0.2% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). In some counties, such as Spain, Porbeagle meat accounts for a significant proportion, at 15%, of all shark meat imported annually (Dent and Clarke 2015).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.   </p><p>In 2008, the Porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation.

The current (2016) measure runs through 2019 and applies to the NEAFC Regulatory Area (high seas). The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Porbeagle as a “Key Shark Species” in 2010, but has yet to set Porbeagle fishing limits. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Porbeagle and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. In 2015, to address depletion in the North Atlantic, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;adopted a requirement for prompt, careful release of Porbeagles retrieved alive in ICCAT-managed fisheries. ICCAT also pledged to consider additional measures if future Porbeagle catches exceed 2014 levels. </p>  <p>To prevent overfishing and allow recovery, it is recommended that Porbeagles be subject to regional and national catch limits based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, as well as improved reporting of catch data (including discards), efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, and full implementation of all commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global
506633,12417,Lutjanus cyanopterus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2016,2015-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widely distributed. Due to its large size (the largest species of <em>Lutjanus </em>in the region) and its spawning in predictable aggregations at specific times of the year, this species is easily targeted and susceptible to overfishing. Larger individuals of this species are known to be ciguatoxic in some areas (smaller adults are often confused with <em>Lutjanus griseus</em>). We calculated three generation lengths to be between 33 and 39 years. Catch has declined over 60% in the US Atlantic over the last 20 years. Mixed landings reported with Gray Snapper have declined by over 50% in Cuba since the 1970s. Declines of spawning aggregations have been reported in Cuba and various areas in Brazil. Catch declines have been on the order of 50-80% in Brazil where limited data are available with the commercial extinction reported of local fisheries associated with overfishing of spawning aggregations. In the Florida Keys, the spawning potential ratio of this species was reported to be at 5% of total. There are areas where this species is not heavily targeted due to its ciguatoxicity such as Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, ~10% of the species range. We infer at least a 30% decline based on declines in landings and the heavy overfishing or complete elimination of spawning aggregations as reported in Cuba, Brazil and elsewhere. Further declines are possible based on continued targeting of spawning aggregations unless protective measures are established and enforced. This species is listed as Vulnerable under A2bd. Monitoring of the abundance of this species and the status of spawning aggregations is needed to better estimate population trends and regional extinction risk.","<em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> is primarily a reef- and hardbottom-associated species as an adult (Starck 1970), but associates with shallow vegetation during early life stages (Lindeman and DeMaria 2005). Adults can be found on the fore slope of deep reefs. Adults are observed at depth ranges of 18-55 m (Lieske and Myers 1994) and deeper, sometimes in association with artificial structure (e.g., lower Florida Keys, Domeier and Colin 1997). Adults can be observed at low abundance at mesophotic depths in Puerto Rico and considered ciguatoxic, especially on the south coast (R. Appeldoorn pers. comm. 2015). This species mainly feeds on ray-finned fishes and less frequently on shrimp and crabs (McEachran and Fechhelm 2005).<br/><br/>This species forms spawning aggregations with known sites in the Florida Keys (Domeier and Colin 1997, Lindeman <em>et al</em>. 2000), Cuba (Claro and Lindeman 2003), and Belize (Heyman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Heyman and Kjerfve 2008). There are at least six potential spawning sites in Puerto Rico and none appeared to be fished out as of 2007 (Ojeda-Serrano <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The maximum length observed is 160 cm TL (Allen 1985), though there are anecdotal reports of 200 cm catches. It is the largest lutjanid species in the western Atlantic. Longevity is estimated at 22 years in the US Gulf of Mexico (SERO 2010) and 20 years in the southeast coast of the US (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998). It may live up to a maximum of 30 years in Colombia (A. Acero pers. comm. 2009). Minimum size of maturation was 2.3 years in Ault <em>et al</em>. (1998) and 4.6 years in SERO (2010) for the US Gulf of Mexico and Florida Keys, respectively. Using IUCN protocols, we calculated generation length as 11 to 13 years, with a three generation length range of 33-39 years.","<em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> populations that are not ciguatoxic are harvested by subsistence, commercial and recreational fisheries depending on the region. Spawning aggregations have been targeted by fishers in areas without ciguatoxic populations resulting in probable reductions in population numbers over decades based on fisher or fishery department communications from several greater Caribbean countries and Brazil (also see Francini Filho&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Heyman<em> et al</em>. 2005).&#160;Overfishing of spawning aggregations remains a major threat to populations of this species that are not highly ciguatoxic.<br/><br/>Coral reef degradation due to coastal development, pollution, blast fishing and tourism may also pose significant local threats to this species. The loss of mangrove forest can impact juvenile habitat use of this species (Lindeman and DeMaria 2005).","Adults can be most abundant in deeper waters but also occur in mid-shelf areas.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>United States<br/></strong>In US waters of the Atlantic Ocean, commercial landings have decreased from 3.8 mt in 1992 to 1.4 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a) a decline of 63%. Smaller adults can be confused with <em>Lutjanus griseus </em>in the Florida Keys and Northern Gulf of Mexico (K. Lindeman pers. comm. 2014). Using data from 1979-1996, Ault <em>et al</em>. (1998) identified potential overfishing in the Florida Keys with the stock at less than 5% of spawning potential ratio (SPR). Commercial landings from US waters of the Gulf of Mexico ranged from 0.1 to 2.2 mt yearly since 1991; landings declined from 2.2 mt in 1997 to 0.3 mt in 2005, and increased up to 1.0 mt in 2013 (NMFS 2015a). In the Gulf of Mexico, <em>L. cyanopterus</em> is not considered to be undergoing overfishing and it is unknown whether it is overfished or approaching overfished conditions (NMFS 2015b).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico<br/></strong>This species can be caught as bycatch in the commercial fisheries that target&#160;<em>L. campechanus</em>&#160;(Red Snapper) off Mexico. This species is sold in the domestic markets of mainly Mexico City and Guadalajara (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;Commercial landings mixed-snapper species (which includes <em>L. cyanopterus</em>) from Mexico declined from 344 mt in 2005 to 85 mt in 2011, a decline of 75% over seven years (FAO 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Cuba<br/></strong>Cubera Snapper catch statistics in Cuba are combined with <em>Lutjanus griseus</em> and represent about 10% of the mixed <em>L. griseus</em> x <em>L. cyanopterus</em> catch (Claro and Lindeman 2008). The total catch has declined by more than 70% over the past 20 years (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). The cumulative landings of the two species increased in the 1970s as a result of greater fishing effort and efficiency. However, in the late 1980s the catches declined markedly to below 600 mt per year, which was half the original production. <em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> can be common and important in recreational fisheries, but because landings data are mixed, it is difficult to determine population status. Both species spawn during the same period and are targeted by fishermen when they form aggregations (Claro <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Cuba, declines in spawning aggregations were reported for multiple sites (Claro and Lindeman 2003). Coupled biophysical models of the transport of <em>L griseus </em>x <em>L. cyanopterus</em> complex snapper larvae suggest substantial intra-island recruitment (Paris <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Caribbean<br/></strong>This species has been considered part of the commercial snapper fisher in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (Appeldoorn <em>et al</em>. 1987). In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, populations and spawning aggregations are in part protected from over-exploitation by the believed presence of ciguatoxins (R. Appeldoorn pers. comm. 2015). Using information from Puerto Rico, Ault <em>et al</em>. (2008) found a SPR of 37% and concluded the species was not overfished and not undergoing overfishing. Cubera Snapper are recorded as ciguatoxic in the Virgin Islands and little or no fishery exists for the species, particularly larger individuals, in much of the Lesser Antilles (Kadison<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Belize, this species is primarily taken during spawning aggregations from April to May (Heyman <em>et al. </em>2005). This species is also exploited as a food fish in Honduras (Gobert <em>et al</em>. 2005) and Jamaica (Thompson and Munro 1983). <em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> has been reported to show population declines in the southern Caribbean (Acero and Garzón 1985, A. Acero and C. Jadot pers. comm. 2009). This species has long been fished in Venezuela by multiple gears (Cervigón <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cervigón 1993).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil<br/></strong>This species has been heavily fished in Brazil according to many reports. In the states of Espírito Santo and Bahia, Brazil, mixed snapper fisheries statistics show a large decline, from 8-9 mt/yr from 1997-2000 to around 3.5 tons/year in 2002 (IBAMA 2003). For the mixed snapper category in Bahia, there was a drop from a maximum 523 mt/yr, in 1997 to 184 mt/yr from 2001 to 2006 (IBAMA 2008), equivalent to a 65% reduction. Landings are concentrated in the spawning aggregation months (February to March) according to REVIZEE data for the state of Bahia (Olavo<em> et al</em>. in prep). In Bahia Baixo Sul, interviews with fishers have indicated a five-fold CPUE reduction (200 kg/fisher/day to 40 kg/fisher/day) for the fisheries on spawning aggregations since the 1980s (Olavo <em>et al</em>. in prep.), which corresponds to a potential 80% decline over a period of three generation lengths (see section below). Under the scope of Pro-Arribada, an assessment of reef fishes spawning aggregations in Brazil, spawning aggregations have been recorded in the north of Bahia (Olavo <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and in Pernambuco and Alagoas (B. Padovani-Ferreira pers. obs. 2011). In Bahia, interviews with fisherman have revealed that the sites traditionally exploited are already overfished, with significant abundance reductions (Olavo <em>et al</em>. in prep.). On the Abrolhos Bank system, after years of heavy fishing, <em>L. cyanopterus</em> has become rare (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). A similar situation exists for the state of Santa Catarina, where spawning aggregations have been reported during the summer months in São Francisco do Sul (Gerhardinger <em>et al</em>. 2007). Reports of aggregations that have altogether disappeared also exist from Florianopolis (F. Grecco pers. comm.). On the southeastern coast of Brazil, this species is threatened and categorized as “collapsed” in the Red List of vertebrates of São Paulo (Sanches <em>et al</em>. 2012).",Decreasing,"<em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> is distributed in the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia, Canada south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along the South American coast to Santa Catarina, Brazil. Its depth range is one metre to at least 85 m (Lindeman <em>et al</em>. 2000).","<em>Lutjanus cyanopterus</em> can be a locally important species due to its very large size, especially in areas where it is not ciguatoxic, a feature which affects local market interest in this species.&#160;It is exploited as a food fish in Belize, Honduras (Gobert <em>et al.</em> 2005), Jamaica (Thompson and Munro 1983), Cuba (Claro and Lindeman 2008), the continental United States (Lindeman <em>et al</em>. 2000) and Brazil (IBAMA 2008). Larger specimens are considered ciguatoxic in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and little or no fishery exists for larger individuals in most of the Lesser Antilles (Kadison<em> et al</em>. 2006).&#160;In some areas (e.g. the Florida Keys) smaller adults are eaten but larger specimens are commonly avoided.",Marine,"This species was ranked as Vulnerable in the 1996 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Huntsman 1996). This species has also been ranked as Vulnerable by a country-specific Red List evaluation in Colombia (Acero and Garzon 1985).<br/>In the United States, the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Councils have size and catch restrictions in place for this species. For both recreational and commercial landings from areas three to 200 miles off the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and east Florida, harvested individuals must be at least 12 inches in length (TL). Additionally, recreational catches are limited to no more than two per people per boat for fish 30"" or larger off of the coast of east Florida (individually or in combination with black grouper).<br/><br/>The minimum size limit in Cuba is one pound and the maximum is 75 cm, above this it can be ciguaotoxic (Claro and Lindeman 2008). Fishing regulations to assist recovery of multispecies spawning aggregation sites including Cubera Snapper have been in place for several years in Cuba (Claro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). However, the measurement of effectiveness has been limited. Protection of the species before, during and after spawning aggregation sequences will be fundamental to sustainable management of this species. It is suggested that in addition to protection of spawning aggregation sites, fishery management measures, such as full no take areas, may be needed (Claro and Lindeman 2003, Paris <em>et al</em>. 2005). The greatest needs appear to be for spawning aggregation protections and protection of mature adults during non-spawning. Monitoring of the abundance of this species and the status of spawning aggregations is needed to best estimate population trends and local and regional extinction risk.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Its generation length is 11 years. It is commercially exploited as a food source with high market value throughout its range. It is targeted for national and international trade not only for its meat, but also its swim bladder which also gains high market prices. Off&#160;Brazil, landings declined by 47-54% between 1997 and 2007 (10 years). There has been no decrease in effort. The area off Brazil comprises approximately 40% of its global range. High catch levels are also reported for Venezuela and French Guyana, but landings data are not available. Overall, data are not available over a period of three generation lengths (33 years). However, it is suspected that since this fishery has been in existence since the late 1800s and effort has only been increasing, it is likely that declines are in the order of at least 30% throughout its range over the three generation length period.

Between 1997-2007 a mean of 7,905 tons were caught with a minimum of 3,610 in 2006 and 12,274 in 2001 in Para State (www.ibama.gov). There is a decline in the landings from Para State ranging from 47-54% depending on whether a linear regression or decline calculated by points (max and min) was used. Although these are landings data, it is known that the effort in the area has not declined. Therefore, the landings are likely a conservative estimation of population declines. Landings in Para State comprise fish that are caught along the coasts of Amapa, Para and Maranhao States. Although there are no catch statistics outside of Brazil, it is assumed that the intensity of fisheries is similar because this species is well-known and has similarly high market values. Therefore, it is inferred that declines are at least 30% over the past ten years throughout its range.</p></span>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is distributed in the western Atlantic from the Gulf of Paria, Venezuela to Maranhao State, Brazil.

It inhabits continental shelves from inshore to depths of 181 m. It is captured using artisanal longlines, gillnets, beach seines, and in industrial shrimp  trawls. This species is inferred to be stable or increasing in the Western Central Atlantic, based on its similarity to the&#160;Bullnose Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis freminvillei</em>). In the Southwest Atlantic artisanal fisheries are intense, further there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas.&#160;In Brazil, landings of eagle rays have been reduced by 60% over 2000–2012 in Santa Catarina State, and a reduction of 91% in Rio Grande do Sul since the 1980s. This inshore eagle ray has no refuge at depth&#160;and is exposed to intense and often unmanaged fishing pressure throughout the Atlantic South American portion of its range and there it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (44 years), but is stable in the Western Central Atlantic. Overall, based its range with the almost all threats found in the Southwest Atlantic, the suspected low productivity of the species, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Southern Eagle Ray inhabits continental shelves from inshore to 181 m depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 115 cm disc width (DW) (Araújo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018); males mature at ~45–55 cm DW and females mature at ~70 cm DW. Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a litter size of six pups (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is estimated to be 14.5 years based on data for the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>),  which has an age-at-maturity of five years and a maximum age of 24  years (Martin and Cailliet 1988), although this may be an overestimation  as that species has a larger maximum size.","The Southern Eagle Ray is captured using artisanal longlines, gillnets, beach seines, and industrial shrimp trawls (Velasco <em>et al. </em>2011, Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2016). There are no known threats in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic but in the Southwest Atlantic artisanal fisheries are intense. Further, there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;This species is caught in gillnets and less frequently in trawls (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2019). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo<em> et al. </em>2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). Gillnets are prevalent and target elasmobranchs (Chiaramonte 1998, Tamini <em>et al. </em>2006, Colautti <em>et al. </em>2010), and this is one of the most valued species in Buenos Aires Province (J-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018). This inshore eagle ray is exposed to intense and often unmanaged fishing pressure throughout the Atlantic South American portion of its range, and it has no refuge at depth.","This species is inferred to be stable or increasing in the Western Central Atlantic, based on its similarity to the Bullnose Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis freminvilli</em>).&#160;In Atlantic South America, there are very few time-series of abundance. In Venezuela there are no data, but this species is captured in large numbers in artisanal fisheries there, which lack management. The situation is suspected to be similar in the Guianas, but there are no data. In northwestern Brazil, fishing pressure is intense and other elasmobranchs have been depleted there, and it is suspected that these fisheries are leading to a reduction in population size in that area. This species is also caught in large numbers in the intense artisanal gillnet, beach seine, and trawl fisheries further south in Brazil, and declines have been reported in Paraná&#160;and Rio Grande do Sul&#160;states&#160;(Araújo&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018). Landings of eagle rays, in general, declined in Santa Catarina state by&#160;60% since the 1980s&#160;(R. Baretto unpubl. data 2018) and declined by&#160;91% in research trawls between 1974–2005 (Ferreira&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), equivalent to a &gt;85% reduction for this species if scaled over three generation lengths (44 years). In Uruguay, <em>Myliobatis</em> species are not exploited by industrial fishing. Eagle rays are generally discarded in artisanal fisheries (or only retained for the fisherman's own consumption) (Silveira <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Uruguayan time series of abundance from spring research cruises between 1984–1995 catches were between 1–3 t, and since 1996 have varied between 0.02 and 0.7 t (L. Paesch unpubl. data 2020, indicating a reduction of equivalent to a &gt;75% reduction for this species if scaled over three generation lengths (44 years). In Argentina, there have been declines reported in eagle rays since the 1980s (Ruocco 2012). Overall, based on its range with the almost all threats found in the Southwest Atlantic, the suspected low productivity of the species, this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in three generation lengths (44 years).

894216,161696,Alopias superciliosus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bigeye Thresher (<em>Alopias superciliosus</em>) is a large (to 484 cm total length) pelagic shark, occurring worldwide in tropical and temperate seas from the surface down to depths of 955 m. It has a low fecundity (average two pups per litter)  and the lowest intrinsic rebound potential of the thresher shark species. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in  pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet  fisheries. Although intrinsically more sensitive to over-exploitation, the Bigeye Thresher is generally deeper and less catchable than its tropical congener the Pelagic Thresher (<em>A. pelagicus</em>). The Bigeye Thresher is often retained for the meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high at-vessel mortality remains a threat where retention is prohibited. The species is estimated to be  declining in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and increasing in a large area around Hawaii with the trends uncertain in the wider Pacific. Globally, the population is estimated to have reduced by 30–49% over the last three generations (55.5 years), based on abundance data and current levels of exploitation. The Bigeye Thresher is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","<p>The Bigeye Thresher is found in coastal waters over continental  shelves, sometimes close inshore in shallow waters, and on the high seas  in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones far from land; it is also  caught near the bottom in deep water on continental slopes (Compagno  2001). It occurs&#160;mostly below 100 m depth but has been recorded to 955 m (Compagno 2001, Coelho <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is present near the surface at night and makes deep dives during the day (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015). It reaches a maximum size of&#160;484 cm total length (TL) (Compagno 2001); males mature at 245–300 cm TL; females mature at 282–355  cm TL (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Moreno and Moron 1992, Stillwelli and Casey 1976, Varghese<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Size at birth is 64–140 cm TL (Golani 1996, Chen&#160;<em>et&#160;</em><em>al.</em>  1997, Bauchot 1987). The gestation period is 12 months with average  litter sizes 2–4 pups per litter, usually two, and the reproductive cycle is likely annual (Compagno 2001,&#160;Varghese<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).  Of the thresher sharks, the Bigeye Thresher has the lowest rate of  annual increase, estimated at 1.6% under sustainable exploitation  (Smith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), or 0.002–0.009 (Cortés 2008, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Observed female age-at-maturity is 12–13 years and maximum age 20 years in Taiwan, Northwest Pacific (Liu <em>et al.</em> 1998). These Taiwanese age data were used to generate growth curves that encompass a wider age and size range than the observed data, and thus were used to estimate female age-at-maturity at 9 years and maximum age at 28 years; generation length is therefore 18.5 years (Chen and Yuan 2006).</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Bigeye Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al. </em>2019, Fauconnet <em>et al. </em>2019). The Bigeye Thresher generally spends time near the surface at night where it is exposed to fisheries capture but it likely has some refuge during the day, when it generally dives to greater depths than those at which most commercial tuna fleets operate.<br/></p>  <p>The species is often retained for the quality meat and the fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due the likelihood of post-release mortality that has been estimated for the congener Common Thresher&#160;as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015). For commercial fisheries, at-vessel hooking mortality for the Bigeye Thresher is high with between 49 and 68% of individuals caught found to be dead on haulback (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, IOTC 2016).</p>","There are no estimates of global population size of the Bigeye Thresher. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between the Northwest Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans (Trejo 2005, Morales <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) relative abundance data in the North Atlantic (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016); (2) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Pacific Ocean (Fu <em>et al</em>. 2018); and, (3) nominal CPUE in the Indian Ocean (E. Romanov unpubl. data). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the relative abundance observer time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992–2013 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had stabilized, while noting that fishing pressure had been present for two decades prior to 1992 and that the abundance had likely stabilized at lower abundance than unexploited biomass (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992–2013 (22 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 83.1% over three generation lengths (55.5 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized, there was an annual rate of reduction in the time-series and this has produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths. In the South Atlantic, CPUE data from a longline fleet indicated a generally decreasing trend from 1971 to 2001 (Mancini 2005), however because the data were not considered robust due to the low catch rates (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analysed over three generations.<br/><br/>Second, a Pacific-wide sustainability risk assessment for Bigeye Thresher reported fishing mortality of this species since 2000 is generally low in Pacific pelagic longline fisheries, yet fishing mortality has exceeded the maximum impact sustainable threshold of the species in some years (Fu <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend analysis of the United States Hawaii longline observer data CPUE for 1995–2014 (20 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.4%, consistent with a median increase of 24.0% over three generation lengths (55.5 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths. These CPUE data are from a large area around Hawaii, but they may not be representative of the entire Pacific region.<br/><br/>Third, Indian Ocean Soviet research nominal CPUE spanning 1966–1986 for aggregated Bigeye Thresher and Pelagic Thresher suggested a decline of approximately 1% per year from 0.35 caught per 1,000 hooks to 0.1 in 1987 (Romanov <em>et al</em>. 2006, E. Romanov unpubl. data). Trend analysis of this data for 1966–1986 (21 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.4%, consistent with a median reduction of 91.8% over three generation lengths (55.5 years), with highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Across the three regions, the Bigeye Thresher is estimated to be declining in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and increasing around Hawaii. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median population reduction was 36.5%, with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. However, the Hawaii region may not correctly represent the Pacific where the trends are uncertain, although a Pacific-wide risk assessment found the risk to sustainability was generally low, and data from the Indian Ocean are for two species and an older time-series. Thus, expert judgement elicitation was used, with an estimated global-scale population reduction of 30-49% over three generation lengths (55.5 years), based on the available abundance data and current levels of exploitation.

Its sandy habitat is largely untrawled in the USA providing some refuge for this species. Elsewhere, it is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial  trawl, handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged  in parts of its range. For example, it is prevalent in Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries and is the third-most caught species in bycatch In the Mexican Caribbean. Although data are sparse in Central America and northern South America, fisheries there are intense in some areas and are largely unmanaged. In northern Brazil, unmanaged trawling and gillnetting has led to steep declines and local extinctions of several sharks and rays. Habitat  loss and degradation due to coastal development and oil exploration are  also threats to this species in many parts of its range. Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fishing pressure  across its range, outside of USA waters, it is suspected that the Freckled Guitarfish has undergone a  population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (18  years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Freckled Guitarfish is a coastal benthic shark-like ray that inhabits sand, algae, and patch reefs from inshore to 30 m depth. It reaches a maximum size of 78 cm total length (TL), and size-at-maturity is unknown. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a litter size of six pups (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is suspected to be about six years, based on data available for the larger congeneric Shovelnose Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos productus</em>), which has a maximum size of 170 cm TL and a generation length of 9 years (Timmons and Bray 1997).","This guitarfish is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial trawl, longline handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged in parts of its range. In the USA, it is a rare bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries (C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). It is also taken in recreational fisheries in Texas and likely elsewhere on the USA coast (Hensley <em>et al.</em> 1998). In Mexican waters of the Caribbean, this species was reported as the third-most abundant species in shrimp bycatch (Garcia-Zúñiga <em>et al.</em> 2019). It has been caught as a frequent bycatch on small-scale longlines in Tabasco since at least the 1980s (Lara-Mendoza <em>et al. </em>2016). Fisheries in general have been declining in the Gulf of Mexico, and some shrimp stocks there have collapsed (J.C. Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). Although there are no data on this species from Central America, artisanal and commercial fisheries there are intense in some areas, and are largely unmanaged. If this species occurs in Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries there are widespread and lack management and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed. In the mid-2000s, this fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world (Duarte<em> et al.</em> 2010). In Venezuela, fishers capture guitarfishes in the intense fisheries  off Margarita Island (Ehemann and González-González 2018), and this  species is likely included if it occurs there. In northern Brazil, artisanal gillnetting  and commercial trawling are intense and have led to steep declines in  other chondrichthyans (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). This guitarfish is caught there in gillnets, including lost and abandoned ghost nets (Lima <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species is also threatened by habitat  loss and degradation due to coastal development and oil exploration through much of its range.","There are no range-wide estimates of population trend for this species. It is captured in mostly unmanaged fisheries, some of which are intense. Historically, this species was locally common in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Walls 1975), with Florida regarded as the centre of abundance (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953), but it is now relatively rare and patchily distributed in Texas (Hensley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)&#160;and throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (Shepherd and Myers 2005). Its sandy habitat is largely untrawled in the USA which provides some refuge for this species (J.K. Carlson pers. comm. 10/08/2020). In the 1980s, shrimp fisheries in Mexico were very intense and there was a steep decline in this shrimp fishery (M.P. Blanco-Para and J.C.&#160;Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). Catches of the Mexican shark fishery declined by 35% over the decade between 1999–2008 due to rising effort and limited regulation (<span class=""s1"">Castillo-Géniz <em>et al. </em>1998,&#160;Pérez-Jiménez and Méndez-Loeza 2015).<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&#160;In other areas of the Western Central Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are dominant and are largely unmanaged.

The estimated generation length is 8.5 years. In Japanese waters, its distribution is apparently restricted to four areas, southern Tohoku, western Seto Inland Sea, western Kyushu, and Tokyo Bay, where it is nearly extinct. The Japanese stock has declined by 80% and possibly more since 1980, or over the past 40 years; this equates to a decline of about 63% over the past three generations. A stock enhancement programme that releases large numbers of hatchery-raised individuals into the wild has been successful. The wild stock on the northern Pacific coast of Japan is suspected to have recovered slightly since 2011, but no evidence of recovery has been detected in the Seto Inland Sea in southwestern Japan. Stocks have also experienced severe depletion in Chinese and Korean waters. In addition to overfishing, degradation of the sensitive inshore nursery habitats contributes to reduced recruitment. Based on these data, and inferring that only a small proportion of its global population occurs in Russian waters where it is naturally rare, it is inferred that this species has undergone a 30-50% global-level decline over the past three generations, and therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd. Due to the lack of species-specific quantified data for much of the distribution, the confidence in a suspected global decline of greater than 50% was low, and therefore, a category of Endangered or Critically Endangered was not supported. Future investigations may reveal a higher global decline than is currently inferred based on the available data, which would necessitate a reassessment. Stronger fisheries management measures are needed to improve the status of this species throughout most of its range. Additionally, the impacts of anthropogenic changes on juvenile habitats and those related to the introduction of large numbers of hatchery-raised juveniles on the wild population require further quantification and monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</span>","This demersal species occurs on sand and mud bottoms in coastal waters. Juveniles utilize shallow, inshore areas as nursery grounds, including estuarine intertidal flats and brackish inlets (Wada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012b,&#160;Hata<em> et al.</em> 2015). Spawning occurs in offshore waters on the outer continental shelf (Wada <em>et al.</em> 2011). The maximum standard length is 60 cm (Nakabo 2013, Parin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;<br/><br/>In Fukushima Prefecture, age at first maturity for females is 3 years and 2 years for males (Shimamura <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Miyagi Prefecture, a 9 year old male and a 14 year old female have been observed (Saeki 1997). This species has been aged to at least 8 years based on specimens from the Bohai Sea (Shuozeng 1995b). When applying an age at first reproduction of 3 years and longevity of 14 years, the estimated generation length based on Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2 is 8.5 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species. Degradation of inshore nursery habitats also negatively impacts this species (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011).","This species is naturally rare in Russian waters and in the Sea of Japan (Sekino <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Parin<em> et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/><strong>Japan</strong>: Formal, quantitative stock assessments are not available for this species in Japan. The stock throughout Japanese waters is currently at a severely depleted level due to overfishing that began prior to the 1990s. For example, in Fukushima Prefecture, landings declined by 81% from 1987 to 1993 and remained low until at least 2010. Significant declines also occurred during the 1980s and 1990s in Tokyo Bay and the Joban area. Catch declines of over 80% occurred in western Kyushu and Nagasaki Prefecture in the 2000s. By the late 2000s, it was reduced to small, localized populations patchily distributed off Tohoku and western Kyushu, Ise Bay, and the western Seto Inland Sea. To aid in stock recovery, a large-scale stock enhancement programme that releases hatchery-raised individuals to the wild has been in place since the 1990s (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2012a, Hata <em>et al.</em> 2015). As a result, millions of juveniles have been released in northeastern, central, and western Japan over the past three decades. Commercial landings increased in Fukushima in the 2000s as a direct result of this programme. About 50% of these landings are now composed of the hatchery-released individuals (Wada<em> et al</em>. 2012a). Data on the status of the natural, wild stock are limited, but the wild stock is suspected to be increasing since 2011, which indicates at least a slight recovery (T. Wada and T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021). No significant increase in the wild stock in the Seto Inland Sea has occurred (Hata <em>et al.</em> 2015). Potential negative impacts from intra-specific competition between wild fish and released fish is a possibility during the juvenile stage when the species has more restrictive habitat requirements and high site fidelity compared to the adult stage, but overall, displacement of wild stock has not yet been detected (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2012a). On the northern Pacific coast of Japan, catch per unit effort (CPUE) was higher in 2012-2015 compared to that of 2008-2010 (Shirakihara <em>et al.</em> 2018). Stock recovery is dependent on increasing recruitment success, which varies with conditions in inshore nursery habitats (Wada <em>et al.</em> 2012a,b, 2014, 2017).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Korea and China</strong>: Quantitative data are limited on the stock status of this species in Chinese and Korean waters. Large-scale demersal trawl fisheries are active in these areas and declines are suspected to be likely, as fishing effort increased significantly over time. Catches in Korean flounder fisheries have been trending downwards since the late 1970s and have been overfished since at least the 1980s&#160;(Chae and Pascoe 2005, Yoon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). This species has become severely depleted in Chinese waters since the 1980s due to overfishing (Tian&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). In Chinese coastal waters, overfishing of the flatfish stocks has occurred at least since the 1980s (Dagang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1992). Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e.&#160;<em>Pleuronichthys&#160;</em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Overfishing in the East China Sea, which is primarily driven by Chinese fishing fleets, has caused steep declines in flatfish stocks there since the late 1990s (Aonuma <em>et al.</em> 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western North Pacific Ocean along continental Asia in the East China, Bohai and Yellow seas; along both coasts of the Korean Peninsula; in the Sea of Japan (including Peter the Great Bay north to Egorov Point and southwestern Sakhalin Island), and off western Japan from the Shakotan Peninsula, Hokkaido to western Kyushu; and along Pacific Japan from Kesennuma, Miyagi to the Seto Inland Sea and Kyushu. The depth range is 1-200 m (Sakamoto 1984, Li and Wang 1995, Shimamura <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sekino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Nakabo 2013, Parin<em> et al</em>. 2014).","This species is targeted and highly valued by commercial fisheries in Japan, Korea, and China. It is also produced for stock enhancement and in the aquaculture industry in these countries (Ge&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).",Marine,"Hatchery-raised individuals are released as part of a programme to enhance the wild population off northeastern Japan (Wada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). We infer that the large-scale release of hatchery-produced individuals should reduce the fishing pressure on the wild stock. Further, there is evidence that hatchery-reared fish are found on the spawning grounds, along with wild fish, and likely are interbreeding. As long as the genetic diversity of the hatchery-reared fish is not constrained, this could have a positive impact on the wild population. However, if the genetic diversity of the hatchery-reared fish is constrained, then this interbreeding could potentially have a negative impact by reducing the genetic diversity of the wild stock. Further work is needed to determine the impacts of large-scale releases of hatchery-reared individuals on the wild population.&#160;<br/><br/>There is a closed season for trawl fishing off northeastern Japan and gear restrictions (Kayaba&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Additional fishery conservation measures in Japan include a minimum landing size. The capture of immature individuals should be reduced to promote population growth (Wada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012a). Improvements in habitat quality of estuarine areas inhabited by juveniles are needed to improve recruitment success and survival.","",,false,false,Global

Estuarine degradation in South Africa has greatly reduced the availability of suitable habitat for this species. Furthermore, this species has been subjected to localized overfishing in certain estuarine systems including Kosi Bay. Catches of <em>A. vagus</em> in the Kosi Bay estuary system have declined substantially due to an increase in artisanal fishing effort; an estimated 60% decline in CPUE from the artisanal trap fishery was recorded from 1986 to 1999, and ~30% decline in CPUE in the recreational fishery from 1995 to 1999. These population declines are exacerbated by persistent drought conditions over the past eight years (2002–2010) in northern KwaZulu-Natal which have substantially contracted available habitat in large coastal estuarine systems particularly Lake St Lucia. However, good rainfall has been recorded in St Lucia since 2011 and although the mouth is still closed, a small channel has been constructed linking the system to the Umfolozi mouth allowing some connection to the sea. The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of its estuarine habitat in South Africa is 532 km<sup>2</sup>; the estuarine habitat in its entire range is extrapolated to be 1,213 km<sup>2</sup> qualifying for Vulnerable under B2ab. In addition, this species is severely fragmented due to the impacts of climate shifting on estuarine environments, limiting suitable habitat and altering connectivity to the sea; given the habitat specificity this species exhibits during certain life stages, this poses a serious threat, meeting the criteria B2a. The limited habitat availability coupled with significant population reductions in excess of 30% over three generation lengths (24 years), places this species at an elevated extinction risk. In addition, the species has a complex population structure as a protandrous hermaphrodite in a degraded and specialized ecosystem. There are fishery regulations in place for this species, however, these are difficult to enforce. An increase in the number of estuarine protected areas (EPAs) is likely to be one of the most effective management interventions. We recommend designation of additional no-take EPAs in KwaZulu-Natal and prevention of illegal fishing. Furthermore, an updated stock assessment for this species is highly recommended.

Adults of this species are rarely found far from estuaries in the marine environment (Wallace 1975, Kyle 1986, Garratt 1993) and feed on a variety of prey including amphipods, polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans, gastropods, aquatic pants and small fish (Day and Morgans 1956, Day <em>et al.</em>&#160;1981, Kyle 1986).&#160;Juveniles 0+ enter estuaries in KwaZulu-Natal at one to five cm SL between July and December (Wallace and van der Elst 1975). Juveniles (two to six cm) of this species feed primarily on amphipods, planktonic copepods, chironomid larvae, tanaids and aquatic plants (Day and Morgans 1956,&#160;Day <em>et al.</em>&#160;1981, Harrison 1991).&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus vagus </em>is resident in localized estuarine areas (Kyle 2000) and only have a marine egg and larval phase (James and Mann 2013). Adults undertake an annual spawning migration down to the estuary mouth (Kyle 1986, Garratt 1993, P. Cowley SAIAB unpublished data). Egg development occurs at sea (Wallace and van der Elst 1975) and were found to be one of the most common eggs collected in a study at the mouth of the Durban Harbour during winter on outgoing spring tides (Connell 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The maximum age for <em>A. vagus </em>is&#160;at least 16 years with a maximum weight of 3.2 kg and maximum length of &#160;75 cm TL (James <em>et al.</em> 2003, South African Light Tackle Boat Angling Association Records 2010, van der Elst 1993).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Reproduction</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Acanthopagrus vagus</em>&#160;is assumed to be a&#160;protandrous hermaphrodite (Garratt 1993a).

A male dominated sex ratio was recorded during a spawning aggregation at the mouth of Kosi (Garratt 1993b).&#160;Spawning occurs in estuary mouths and in nearshore marine environments while eggs are transported into the marine environment during peak ebb tides and larval development takes place at sea (Wallace 1975b, Garratt 1993b, Harris and Cyrus 1996, Whitfield 1998). The spawning season was recorded to occur from April to July in KwaZulu-Natal with a peak season from May to June (Wallace 1975). In the Durban Harbour, spawning was recorded from as early as March peaking from July to August (Connell 2012).<br/><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);""><br/></span>Generation length for<em>&#160;A. vagus</em>&#160;is estimated to be eight years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>","Currently,&#160;<em>A. vagus</em> is heavily overexploited in the Kosi system and the stock is considered to have collapsed (James <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Minimum size and bag limit regulations appear to be ineffective as there is inadequate compliance with regulations in the trap and gillnet fisheries as they are poorly managed. The recent rapid and uncontrolled escalation of fishing effort by the trap-fishery is cause for concern as it could lead to a rapid deterioration in stock status (James <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kyle 2013). In addition to increased fishing pressure on estuaries, degradation of estuarine habitats in KwaZulu-Natal, including reduced freshwater inflows have most likely had a serious effect on populations of this estuarine-dependent species (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2000). Drought conditions over the past eight years (2002–2010) in northern KwaZulu-Natal have substantially contracted available habitat in large coastal estuarine systems particularly Lake St Lucia. However, good rainfall has been recorded in St Lucia since 2011 and although the mouth is still closed, a small channel has been constructed linking the system to the Umfolozi mouth allowing some connection to the sea (B. Mann pers. comm.).&#160;It is suggested as a useful indicator species of environmental quality in subtropical South African estuaries (Whitfield 1997).<br/><br/>Estuaries are often subjected to multiple stressors as a result of coastal anthropogenic actives as well as habitat shifting and degradation from climate change (Thrush&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). These impacts can result in the loss of connectivity, potentially isolating populations and communities and limiting them to suboptimal habitats (Tilman <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Fahrig 2003, Holyoak <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Crooks and Sanjayan 2006). The cumulative impacts pose a major threat to <em>A. vagus</em>&#160;due to its habitat specificity during certain life stages.","As&#160;<em>A. vagus </em>is largely restricted&#160;to the estuarine environment (except during the egg and larval phase when it is found in the marine environment), the stock has been greatly reduced as a result of estuarine degradation and overexploitation and is considered to be collapsed in Kosi Bay, with spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) estimated at &lt;25%&#160;(James <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Estimates suggest that there were between 45,000 and 56,000 individuals of <em>A. vagus</em>&#160;&gt;22 cm TL in the Kosi Bay system from 1984 to 1985 based on a tag-recapture study (Kyle and Robertson 1997). Stock assessments of <em>A. vagus</em> in Kosi Bay in northern KwaZulu-Natal indicate that this species is likely to have been reduced to around 24% of its pristine level of spawner biomass per recruit at current levels of fishing mortality (James <em>et al. </em>2008). The recent severe drought in Lake St Lucia, which comprises 80% of the estuarine area in KwaZulu-Natal, has also had a substantial impact on the <em>A. vagus</em> population in that system (Cyrus and Vivier 2006).&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus vagus</em> is the only sparid in southern Africa that has been regularly recorded in rivers and associated freshwater pans (Skelton 1993).<br/><br/>CPUE decreased significantly from 0.017 fish/angler/hour in 1986 to 0.007 fish/angler/hour<sup></sup> in 1999 (~58%) in Kosi Bay recreational catches (James <em>et al</em>. 2001). CPUE also had a downward trend in St Lucia between 1956 and 1977 based on NCAU competition data (van der Elst 1978).&#160;Trend in catch composition of&#160;<em>A. vagus&#160;</em>by mass remained relatively constant in the Kosi recreational fishery from 1987 to 1995 and subsequently declined from 4.1% in 1994 to 0.6% in 1999 (James&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;The number of fish traps and number of baskets per trap has increased exponentially in recent years and has resulted in the reduction of <em>A. vagus</em>&#160;in the Kosi system (Kyle 2013). The St Lucia recreational fishery CPUE had an overall increasing trend from 1989 to 1999 (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002); however, the subsequent drought and extended closure of the St Lucia system since 2002 has resulted in an extremely low catch of <em>A. vagus </em>as revealed by a seine and gill net survey conducted between 2006 and 2008 (Vivier <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Contribution of <em>A. vagus</em>&#160;by number in the St. Lucia recreational fishery peaked at 37% in 1994 and remained relatively high thereafter (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002).<em> Acanthopagrus vagus</em>&#160;only comprised 0.2% of the catch in a seine and gill-net survey conducted from 2006 to 2008, after almost five years of estuary closure (Vivier <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). The mean size of fish captured in Kosi Bay from 1985 to 1998 was 31.4 cm TL while fish caught in 2001 were smaller with a mean size of 26.9 cm TL (James <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). A sex ratio of 8.8:1 (M:F) was recorded during a spawning aggregation at the mouth of Kosi (Garratt 1993). <strong><br/></strong>",Decreasing,"<em>Acanthopagrus vagus</em>&#160;is endemic to southern Africa, ranging from Knysna, Western Cape, South Africa to southern Mozambique (Iwatsuki and Heemstra 2010).&#160;<em>Acanthopagrus vagus</em>&#160;is common in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and northwards to at least central Mozambique (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004, Iwatsuki and Heemstra 2010).&#160;This species has not been confirmed in Madagascar but is likely to occur in that area (Iwatsuki and Heemstra 2010).&#160;The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of the estuarine habitat of this species in South Africa is estimated at 505 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;including some 194 estuaries (van Niekerk and Turpie 2011).

This species is an important component of estuarine sport anglers catches in KwaZulu-Natal. <em>Acanthopagrus vagus</em> is caught by subsistence and artisanal fishers in St Lucia, Kosi Bay and in other estuarine systems in KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique using lines, fish traps and gill-nets (Kyle 1986,&#160;Mann 1995,&#160;Kyle 1999, Kyle 2013).<br/><br/><em>Acanthopagrus vagus </em>is taken by recreational boat, shore anglers, and by subsistence fishers using lines, fish traps, and gillnets (James and Mann 2013). In the three large estuaries of northern KwaZulu-Natal (Kosi Bay, St Lucia and Richards Bay),&#160;<em>A. vagus</em>&#160;is of particular importance to the recreational and subsistence catches (James 2001, James <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Beckley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008) as well as in the Durban Harbour (Pradervand <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Fishing mortality in the Kosi system was calculated to be 1.88 per year<sup></sup>, 87% of which was attributed to trap-fishing, 6% to gill-net and 7% to recreational fishing (James <em>et al. </em>2008).",Marine,"<em>Acanthopagrus vagus </em>is a prohibited species for commercial fisheries&#160;in South Africa (i.e. no sale allowed). For recreational fishers, there is a daily bag limit of five fish per person per day and a minimum size limit of 25 cm TL in place (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012). However, minimum size and daily bag limitations seem to be ineffective as conservation tools for this species as there is a high amount of non-compliance of these regulations, especially in the trap and gill-net fisheries (Kyle 1999) and the overall management of <em>A. vagus</em>&#160;is poor in the region (James <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;<br/><br/>Some protection is afforded to <em>A. vagus</em> in the St Lucia Wilderness Area, Lake Amanzimnyama (fourth lake in Kosi Bay), the mouth area of the Kosi estuary, the Mhlatuze estuary and in the Mtentu, and Msikaba estuaries within the Pondoland MPA, as these areas are closed to fishing (B. Mann, ORI, personal observation). However, all of these no-take EPAs are exposed to illegal gill-netting (Mann <em>et al. </em>1998) .&#160;<br/><br/>Establishment of additional no-take EPAs in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape and the prevention of illegal fishing would be beneficial for <em>A. vagus</em>. Illegal seine and gill-net fisheries in the Mhlatuze Estuary needs to be addressed especially because of the poor status of this species in Kosi Bay and St Lucia. In Kosi Bay the number of fish traps and baskets needs to be drastically reduced, channels between lakes should be kept open and fish traps should not be permitted to extend into those channels. A channel should be kept open between fish kraals on either side within the lakes and upper estuary&#160;(James and Mann 2013, Kyle 2013).","",,false,false,Global

Anecdotal evidence suggests a shrinking in the historical range with the catch of <em>P. praeorbitalis</em> in southern Mozambique comprising &lt;1% of the total linefish catch. This species is both commercially and recreationally targeted and exhibits life history characteristics that exacerbate its vulnerability to overexploitation. <em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em>&#160;is estimated to attain more than 13 years in age and does not reach maturity until about six years of age. Evidence suggests that <em>P. praeorbitalis</em>&#160;is a protogynous hermaphrodite but this has not yet been confirmed. Further study is required to learn more about the reproductive biology of this species as well as its spawning and movement patterns. Strict fishery regulations have been implemented for <em>P. praeorbitalis </em>and it is also afforded some protection by MPAs.&#160;<em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em>&#160;has experienced major declines in CPUE while SBPR is estimated to be &lt;25%, indicative of a collapsed stock. CPUE declined by ~65% from the period 1928–1941 to 1985–1992, and total reported commercial catches decreased from 14 tonnes to three tonnes from 1985 to 2007. Extrapolated over three generation lengths (18 years), this approaches population declines of between 30%-50%.&#160;It is therefore listed as Vulnerable under A2bd.","Juveniles of this species are found on shallow rocky reefs from 10 to 30 m depth along the southern Kwazulu-Natal and Eastern Cape coasts (Mann<em> et al.</em> 2006), while adults are found on deeper rocky reefs from 20 m to 120 m (Garratt <em>et al.</em> 1994, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). This species is primarily a piscivore, feeding on small reef fish species, but its diet also includes benthic cephalopods and crustaceans (Smale 1986, Garratt <em>et al.</em>1994). Juveniles are fairly resident on shallow reefs but recent tagging results suggest that adult can fish move northward &gt;300 km and into deeper water, which may be for breeding purposes, while juveniles appear to be fairly resident, with a linear home range size of ~760 m (Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013a). This trend has been confirmed by the larger average size class of fish recorded off Richards Bay compared to southern KwaZulu-Natal (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2005). The maximum age recorded for&#160;<em>P. praeorbitalis</em>&#160;is 13 years, at a length of 72 cm FL; however, this species is believed to attain ages greater than 13 years as it had been collected at lengths exceeding 85 cm (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Mann and Garratt 2012). The maximum recorded length for this species is 90 cm TL (Smith and Heemstra 1991), and the recorded maximum weight is 10.5 kg (South African Deep Sea Angling Association 2012).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><br/><em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis </em>is believed to be a protogynous hermaphrodite but this has yet to be confirmed (Garratt <em>et al. </em>1994, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Age at 50% maturity is estimated at six years and length at first maturity is estimated at ~40 cm (Mann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Although there are limited data, this species appears to have an extended spawning season during winter and spring. Little spawning activity was recorded from southern KwaZulu-Natal with more reproductively active fish recorded from Richards Bay northwards (Garratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>P. praerorbitalis</em> is estimated to be about six years, using the following equation for a protogynous fish species: Generation length =SR* (Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)+(Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>)","<em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em>&#160;is vulnerable to overexploitation as is it targeted both commercially and recreationally and exhibits life history traits that exacerbates its risk of extinction.

Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of <em>P. praeorbitalis</em> declined significantly off KwaZulu-Natal by ~65% from 127 kg per man per year between 1928-1941 to 17 kg per man per year<sup></sup> between 1985-1992&#160;(Garratt <em>et al. </em>1994, Penney <em>et al.</em> 1999). A per-recruit stock assessment conducted in 2004&#160;showed that the stock had been reduced to approximately 21% of spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) despite the implementation of catch restrictions in 1984 and 1992, including minimum size limits and bag limits (Mann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). The stock status of <em>P. praeorbitalis</em> was considered to be even lower than was estimated because of the lack of sufficient samples and a poorly estimated mortality rate (Mann and Garratt 2012). Total reported commercial catches have dropped from around 14 tonnes/year to two tonnes/year between 1985 and 2007, and targeted CPUE declined from 0.08 to 0.04 kg per man per hour over this period (NMLS unpublished data).&#160;Catch composition of <em>P. praeorbitalis&#160;</em>declined from 2.9% of total commercial KwaZulu-Natal line-fish catches from the period 1928-1941 to 1.6% in the period 1985-1992 (Garratt<em> et al.</em> 1994).&#160;Significant change in mean size of this species was observed from the period 1979-1981 (35.7 cm FL) to the period 1990-1992, with recent catches containing fewer larger fish (Garratt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). The mean size had increased to 39.7 cm FL during 2003, but this was likely to have been influenced by the increase in the minimum size limit from 30 cm to 40 cm TL (Mann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Fish in the Richards Bay area were significantly larger than those on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast (Garratt<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1994, Mann&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><p>The sex ratio of this species was heavily skewed towards females due to the removal of larger male fish&#160;and&#160;increased with increasing latitude from Richards Bay (1:2.6) to Ramsgate (1:99) &#160;(Garratt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). A male:female sex ratio of 1:9 for <em>P. praeorbitalis</em>&#160;was observed primarily on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p><p>Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African line-fishery, from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term fisheries rights allocation process implemented in 2006 (Depaertment of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em> is endemic to southern Africa (Smith and Heemstra 1986, van der Elst 1988, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004), and occurs from Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, South Africa; to Beira, Mozambique (Fischer and Bianchi 1984, Smith and Heemstra 1991), with the core distribution between the former Transkei and southern Mozambique (Garratt <em>et al. </em>1994). There is evidence that suggests that the historical range of&#160;<em>P. praeorbitalis</em>&#160;has contracted as this species has become rare in southern Mozambique (van der Elst <em>et al.</em> 1994). The depth range for adults of this species is 20 to 120 m (Garratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and 10 to 30 m for juveniles (Mann <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).","<em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis </em>forms&#160;a small but important component of commercial and recreational ski-boat catches on the lower KwaZulu-Natal south coast and the former Transkei coast of South Africa (Garratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Mann <em>et al</em>. 1997, Penney <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fennessey <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Mann <em>et al. </em>2005, Dunlop 2011).&#160;<em><br/></em><br/>The mean commercial catch of&#160;<em>P. praeorbitalis&#160;</em>per annum for the period 1928-1941 was 28.4 tonnes and comprised 2.9% of the total line-fish catch composition, and declined to 12.6 tonnes per annum and&#160;1.6% of the total line-fish catch for the period&#160;1985-1992 (Garratt <em>et al</em>. 1994).&#160;<em>Polysteganus praeorbitalis</em>&#160;comprised 1.56% of the total monitored commercial line-fish catch by weight in KwaZulu-Natal between 2008-2009 (Dunlop and Mann 2013).",Marine,"The first conservation actions for this species were implemented in South African legislation in 1984 and included a minimum size limit of 25 cm TL and a bag limit of five fish per person per day (pppd) (regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 58 of 1973). Amendments were made to this legislation in 1992 including an increased minimum size limit to 30 cm TL (regulations in terms of the Sea Fisheries Act No. 12 of 1988). Further amendments were made in April 2005 whereby the daily bag limit was further reduced to one fish pppd, applying to both commercial and recreational line-fishers, and the minimum size limit was increased to 40 cm TL (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012). Based on SBPR model predictions, effective implementation of these later regulations should result in stock rebuilding (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2005). In addition to traditional fisheries management measures, a number of large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established along the South African coast. One of the most recent MPAs to be established was the Pondoland MPA between Port Edward and Port St Johns and extending out to the 1,000 m depth contour (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2006). The Pondoland MPA has been shown to be particularly important for the protection of resident juveniles (Maggs 2011, Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013a) and evidence indicates that this MPA offers important protection for adults as there was a marked increase in abundance and a larger mean size of <em>P. praeorbitalis</em>&#160;inside versus outside the refuge (Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013b).&#160;It is believed that deep reefs in the St Lucia and Maputaland MPAs also provide important protection for adults of this species (K.

This species exhibits many life history traits that make it vulnerable to overexploitation, including longevity, slow growth, limited range, hermaphroditism, large bodied, apex predator, and high residency. This species was heavily exploited throughout the 20th century and has experienced population decline, decrease in mean size, and skewed sex ratios as a result of the removal of large males. Although <em>C. nasutus </em>only comprises a small component of the commercial line-fishery, significant declines in catch and CPUE have been observed. MPAs play a major role in the conservation of this species as indicated by the increasing trend in abundance of <em>C. nasutus</em>&#160;in protected areas. The de-commercialization of <em>C. nasutus</em>, implementation of a slot size limit, and the retention of no-take status in the existing MPA network are recommended. Targeted commercial effort data indicate that CPUE and catch declined significantly from the mid 1980s to the early 2000s and are indicative of a population decline of over 30%&#160;within three generation lengths (48 years). Although a formal stock assessment has not been conducted for this species, it is clear that this species has experienced significant declines in less than three generation lengths, and given the life history traits of this species, heavily skewed sex ratios and its dependence on MPAs, this species is at a higher risk of extinction.&#160;It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable under A2bd.","<em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em>&#160;is a&#160;solitary species with a generalist diet consisting primarily of molluscs, crustaceans, and echinoderms as adults (Buxton and Clarke 1989, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). Adults of this species occur on deeper high-profile inshore and offshore reefs (Buxton and Smale 1984, Buxton and Clarke 1989, King and Fraser 2001) while juveniles use shallow sub-tidal reefs &lt;10 m depth as nursery habitats (Buxton and Clarke 1989, Mann <em>et al. </em>2006). Tag recapture data have shown that juveniles and sub-adults are extremely resident and, although limited, data on movements of larger adults does suggest an easterly movement up the coast (ORI Tagging Project unpublished data). Growth studies based on age determination of otoliths show that <em>C. nasutus </em>is slow growing&#160;and long lived with the oldest recorded age being 45.5 years (Buxton and Clarke 1989).&#160;The maximum length recorded for this species is 109.9 cm FL (Buxton and Clarke 1989) with a maximum weight of 37.8 kg (South African Deep Sea Angling Association 2012).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><br/><em>Cymatoceps nasutus </em>is assumed to be a protogynous hermaphrodite (Buxton and Clarke 1989) and data suggest that spawning occurs between May and October in Transkei waters (Buxton and Clarke 1989).

Size at 50% maturity is unknown for this species but the smallest reproductively active female collected by Buxton and Clarke (1989) was 53 cm FL, and age at 50% maturity is estimated to be ~10 years based on observed size at maturity.

Their aggressive nature as dominant reef predators further accentuates their vulnerability to capture. Male and female sex ratios are heavily biased towards females, which is exacerbated by the removal of large males from the population (Murray and Cowley 2012). Although not known, is it suspected that females may be changing sex at a smaller length and a younger age as a result of overexploitation (T. Murray DIFS pers obs.).","<em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em>&#160;was heavily exploited throughout the 20th century which has led to a decrease in abundance and mean size (Penney <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Although a formal stock assessment has not been undertaken for <em>Cymatoceps nasutus</em>, the trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) has declined significantly in KwaZulu-Natal (Penney <em>et al.</em> 1999) and it is estimated that the stocks have declined to ~20% of their historical values (Griffiths and Lamberth 2002). CPUE of <em>C. nasutus</em> in Tsitskamma National Park showed an increase from 1998 to 2005 CPUE (Götz <em>et al. </em>2008) while CPUE in the no-take zones of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area (MPA) was higher (0.37 fish/angler/hr) than in the adjacent exploited area (0.23 fish/angler/hr) from 2006 to 2011 (Maggs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;Using targeted commercial effort data, there has been a significant decline in CPUE from 0.43 kg/man/hr in 1985 to 0.33 kg/man/hr in 2007 (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data).&#160;Increasing mean annual CPUE (~55%) over the last eight years (between 1998 and 2005) in Tsitsikamma National Park&#160;was recorded&#160;(James<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2012); however, this figure should be viewed with caution as the generation time for <em>C. nasutus</em>&#160;is 16 years.&#160;<br/><br/>There was little change in total commercial catch between 1930–1933 (10 tonnes) and 1986–1987 (12 tonnes) in KwaZulu-Natal (Buxton and Clarke 1989).

The Tsitsikamma National Park has&#160;been shown to provide an important refuge for juveniles and sub-adults of <em>C. nasutus </em>(Buxton and Smale 1989, Götz <em>et al</em>. 2008). As the adults probably spawn in the area between East London and St Lucia, the only MPAs which provide protection for adults of this species are the Amathole MPA, Dwesa-Cwebe MPA and the Pondoland MPA (B.

It occurs in rocky reefs up to 120 m depth. This species is an important component of commercial and recreational linefisheries in South Africa where four separate stocks have been reported between Port Nolloth and the Kei River: Western Cape, Southwestern Cape, Southern Cape and Southeastern Cape. White Stumpnose is also caught as bycatch by inshore trawlers on the Southeastern and Southern Cape coasts.

Juveniles are common in estuaries and bays, including the surf-zone, seagrass beds and coastal lagoons (Talbot 1955; Lasiak 1981; Wallace <em>et al. </em>1984; Bennett 1989; Whitfield and Kok 1992; Lamberth <em>et al. </em>1994, 1995; Clark 1997; Griffiths <em>et al. </em>2002; Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). A subpopulation of&#160;<em>R. globiceps</em>&#160;occurs in Langebaan Lagoon, Saldanha Bay and frequents tidal channels with sandy bottoms &lt;10 m depth (Arendse 2011).&#160;Adults disperse offshore in winter and concentrate inshore at depths &lt; 60m in response to oceanographic patterns in summer (Griffiths <em>et al.</em> 2002). Acoustic telemetry work has shown that this is a relatively mobile species (Attwood <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kerwath <em>et al. </em>2008). Fish migrate across the bay, spending June to August in Saldanha Bay and the remainder in Langebaan Lagoon where they exhibit a degree of site fidelity but also undertake diel commuting behaviour (Attwood <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Kerwath <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). This species primarily feeds on crustaceans and molluscs. Larger individuals are able to crush clams, gastropods, and mussels (Griffiths <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). Juvenile&#160;<em>R. globiceps </em>feed on small crustaceans including amphipods, isopods, ostracods and filamentous algae (Griffiths <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).

Length at 50% maturity ranges from 15.3 cm FL to 23.6 cm FL for males and 22.2 cm FL for females (Griffiths <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Attwood <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>R. globiceps</em> is estimated to be nine years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>","Based on the slow growth rate and maximum age of more than 20 years,&#160;<em>R. globiceps</em>&#160;is vulnerable to overfishing (Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2002).

In South Africa, the stock of<em> Rhabdosargus globiceps</em>&#160;is considered to have collapsed with spawning biomass per recruit below 25% but the results of the analysis were speculative without a reliable measure of natural mortality (Arendse 2011). However, there is additional evidence that suggests that the stocks on the Southern Cape coast and on the west of Cape Peninsula, and Table Bay have collapsed (Attwood and Kerwath 2012).&#160;There are four separate stocks of <em>R. globiceps</em> between Port Nolloth and the Kei River: Western Cape (Saldanah Bay), Southwestern Cape, Southern Cape and Southeastern Cape (Griffiths<em> et al. </em>2002). A comprehensive stock assessment has not been conducted on <em>R. globiceps</em>; however, catch rates of commercial linefishers declined over the past 100 years by as much as 68% off the West Coast, 52% off the Southwestern Cape and 99.8% off the Southern Cape (Griffiths 2000). The severe decline in the Southern Cape is probably because the stock is also trawled in this area (Griffiths <em>et al.</em> 2002). Recorded commercial catches have declined considerably since the late 1980s (NMLS unpublished data).&#160;Catch data from Angola and Namibia are limited for this species.<br/>  <p>Commercial data show that since 2000 commercial fishing effort has declined dramatically in the South African line fishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels in line with the long-term rights allocation in 2006 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012).&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Rhabdosargus globiceps</em> is endemic to southern Africa and is known from southern Angola to the Kei River on the east coast of South Africa (Whitfield 1998).

This species is also very sensitive to the effects of protection as shown by its abundance within protected areas in the Mediterranean and its scarcity outside of them, indicating that <em>D. dentex</em>&#160;is conservation dependent. Global landings of this species increased substantially in the 1970s and 1980s but declined by over 30% in the early 1990s. Similar trends were observed in the Mediterranean and West African catches. These regions are major components of <em>D. dentex </em>landings and&#160;have declined by 37% and over 70%, respectively. There is no evidence of a decline in effort from these regions. This species is assessed as Vulnerable in the Mediterranean and Europe, which comprise more than half of this species' range. Global population declines for<em> D. dentex&#160;</em>are estimated to have exceeded 30% within the past three generations (=36 years). It is therefore listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2bd.<br/><br/><strong>Europe</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The Mediterranean Sea comprises a large part of the range for <em>D. dentex</em> in the region and it is estimated that the population has declined at least 50% within three generation lengths, and fishing effort is not expected to decrease in the near future. Therefore this species is listed as Vulnerable.","<em>Dentex dentex&#160;</em>is littoral and benthopelagic, it lives on rocky bottoms, <em>Posidonia</em> <em>oceanica </em>meadows, sandy habitats with <em>Caulerpa </em>and&#160;<em>Cymodocea</em> and in the coralligenous community, down to 200 m, but mainly between 15–50 m (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 1987, Ramos-Esplá and Bayle-Sempere 1991, Abellán 2000, Guidetti 2000, Rueda and Martinez 2001,&#160;Ballesteros 2006, Stobart <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is common at depths of 60 m, but is also found to 100 m (Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997). Adults are solitary, the young gregarious. Juveniles inhabit shallow water to four metres depth between <em>Posidonia oceanica</em> meadows and sand and close to crevices and small caves (Dulčić <em>et al.</em> 2002;&#160;Valle and Bayle-Sempere 2009).&#160;This species feeds on fishes, molluscs and cephalopods (Frimodt 1995).&#160;This species can reach over one meter in length (Fischer <em>et al. </em>1987) and weigh up to 13 kg, although most catches average 35 to 40 cm (Bauchot and Hureau 1986, Ramos-Esplá and Bayle-Sempere 1991). The maximum lifespan appears to be approximately 20 years (Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997), although longevity has been reported up to 33 years (Chemmam-Abdelkader<em> et al.</em> 2004). No major differences in morphology or length/weight ratios were observed between males and females (Rueda and Martinez 2001). Growth proceeds at a fast pace during the first two years, with animals reaching around 24 cm at one year, with their growth slowing down during adulthood (Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997). Growth rates of <em>D. dentex</em> are not affected by the reproductive period (Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997). In all likelihood, the large adult size of the species reduces the number of potential predators&#160;(Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997). Relative fecundity for <em>D. dentex</em>&#160;can range from&#160;&#160;32,000 to 393,000 eggs/kg body weight, and a positive linear relationship between batch fecundity and body size was found (Loir <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>It is a gonochoristic species, with spawning taking place between the end of March and May. Males and females older than one year mature almost simultaneously. The length at 50% maturity for females of this species from the Balearic Islands is estimated at 36.4 cm and 52.02 cm for males (Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997), and 23.32 cm for males and 22.58 cm for females from the Tunisian coast (Chemmam-Abdelkader&#160;2004). Sexually mature females were detected at a minimum standard length of 21 cm in culture (Loir&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001). Sexual maturation and reproduction occur between an age of two and four years (Riera&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Abellán&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Morales-Nin and Moranta 1997). This species is suspected to spawn in the Bay of Biscay (Quéro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) and information from Corsica suggests that during the spawning period, the populations of <em>D. dentex</em>&#160;gather periodically on spawning sites at 40–100 m depth to form shoals. The spawning sites of this species are usually hard substrates such as rocky outcrops or wrecks and mating usually occurs during the day but may also take place at night during a full moon&#160;(Marengo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<strong><br/></strong><br/>Generation length for <em>D. dentex</em> is estimated to be 12 years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>","This species is an important food fish and overexploitation and eutrophication are considered threats in parts of its range. <em>Dentex dentex</em>&#160;is highly vulnerable to fishing due to its life history characteristics including its longevity, large size and slow growth (Garcias-Rubies and Zabala 1990, Garcia-Rubies <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). There has been an increase in demand for this species in Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s due to increases in coastal tourist resorts and restaurants (K. Bizsel pers. comm.).","According to FAO Fisheries Statistics (2011), global landings since 1975 show an overall decline in <em>D. dentex&#160;</em>catches. Catches increased rapidly through the 1980s and early 1990s until dropping substantially from 10,101 tonnes in 1992 to a low of 1,294 tonnes in 1998. The average global decline since 1992 is about 36%. The Mediterranean catch contributes ~45% of the global catch, while the West African and the Northeast Atlantic catches comprise 35% and 18%, respectively. Mediterranean catches also show an overall decline since 1975, peaking in 1990 at over 6,000 tonnes and subsequently declining to less than 1,000 tonnes by 1999, and then rising slightly to 1,147 tonnes in 2011. In the Mediterranean, average catches declined by about 37% since 1990. In West Africa, catches are also in decline, peaking in 1992 at 5,009 tonnes and then declining to less than 50 tonnes by 2010, indicating an average decline of over 70%. <br/><br/>The only stock assessment studies available for this species were conducted in Tunisia. The stocks were addressed according to different regions: Northern, Eastern and South (Chemmam-Abdelkader 2004, FAO 2008). The northern stock was assessed as under-exploited, the Eastern was optimal, and the Southern region was strongly over-exploited&#160;(Chemmam-Abdelkader 2004). Fishing in the Southern region is carried out on small size classes and is comprised of mainly juveniles (Chemmam-Abdelkader <em>et al.</em> 2007) with the average age of the stock at 1.9 years which is very low considering the longevity of <em>D. dentex</em>&#160;(Chemmam-Abdelkader <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). <br/><br/>There has been a significant population decline in Turkey (Fricke&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007).

It is regularly present in the markets of Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Tunisia and Morocco, and also occasionally in France, but rarely in Israel. Greece, Turkey, Italy, Tunisia and Spain account for about 90% of landings (Basurco <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Restrictions on spear fishing and the establishment of minimum legal sizes have been recommended (A. Di Natale, Acquario di Genova, pers. comm.). Other recommendations include enforcement of minimum catch sizes in areas where they are already established (e.g. 20 cm in Turkey; K.

Generation length is estimated as six to 14 years. Biomass declines of 20-66% over the past three generation lengths or more have been reported in parts of its range including the U.S. southeast coast and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Commercial landings have increased in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as the fishery is becoming more efficient, but landings have decreased in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico. It is considered overexploited in Trinidad and Tobago and in Puerto Rico, and reductions of CPUE in the order of 50% have been documented in Venezuela. There is evidence of overfishing in several regions of Brazil.&#160;It is federally managed in U.S. waters, and&#160;stock assessments conclude it is currently not overfished nor undergoing overfishing. It is&#160;not targeted in Cuba and may find some refuge in deeper areas in its range. We suspect an estimated decline of at least 30% in its population over the past three generation lengths overall and it is listed as Vulnerable under A2bd. It is strongly recommended that population and fishery monitoring of this species be conducted and that management be developed or improved in areas it is fished.","This species is found in moderately deep waters, most common over rock, gravel or sand bottoms near the edge of continental and insular shelves commonly from 40-100 m depth (Cervigón <em>et al.</em> 1993). Young fish occur in shallower depths. It often forms large schools, particularly the younger fish. This species feeds on benthic and pelagic fishes, shrimps, crabs, polychaetes, cephalopods and other invertebrates (Sedberry and Cuellar 1993). The spawning season for Gulf Vermilion Snapper is mid-April through mid-September (SEDAR 2006). The spawning period off North and South Carolina (Cuellar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996) and west-central Florida (Hood and Johnson 1999) is approximately the same. In Trinidad and Tobago, spawning occurs throughout the year, with a period of peak spawning from about June to November (Manickchand-Heileman and Phillip 1999). This species spawns between February and March in Abrolhos Bank, Brazil (Freitas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, approximately 80% of females were found to be mature at one year of age, and 100% were mature by two years of age (Hood and Johnson 1999). This species can live approximately 20 to 26 years in the Gulf of Mexico based on otolith data (Allman <em>et al</em>. 2005, Johnson<em> et al</em>. 2010). Individuals recruit to the handline and recreational fisheries at about four to five years, and few individuals above 10 years are caught in any sector (SEDAR 2006). The average age of mature adults based on age frequency in commercial and recreational landings, is approximately five years (SEDAR 2006). In Trinidad and Tobago, this species appears to grow slower and attain a smaller asymptotic length, but has a longer lifespan than found in populations in higher latitudes. This may be attributed to different levels of exploitation, which may be higher in the latter areas (Manickchand-Heileman and Phillip 1999). A comparison of commercially caught legal and sub-legal Vermilion Snapper in the southwest US, suggested that the commercial crews are capturing large, young snapper, which may result in the heavily exploited stocks consisting predominantly of slow-growing individuals. Further, although the average growth rate appeared to have increased as compared to previous time periods (1979-1981 and 1985-1993), larger fish were not growing faster, suggesting that the portion of the population that is larger than the minimum size limit may be old, slow-growing individuals (Stephen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>Generation length was calculated with two primary IUCN approaches: 1). age of first reproduction + [z * (longevity-age of first reproduction)] and 2). 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction. Estimates were 14 and six years respectively for each method using data from SERO (2010), for the US Gulf of Mexico, resulting in an estimated three generation length range of 18-42 years.","This species is one of the more common deep-water lutjanids caught in the southeastern U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean and Brazil. Apart from being targeted in many fisheries, it is also caught as bycatch in shrimp trawls. An analysis of electric-reel, rod and hand-line fishing impacts on this species concluded that in terms of gear impacts on several aspects of this species and its larger community, the species is a yellow (good alternative, Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch) seafood recommendation (Fisher 2013).&#160;It has been recorded in the diet of the invasive Lionfish in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Dahl and Patterson 2014).&#160;Areas of high invasive Lionfish density may also affect populations on a localized basis; therefore, Lionfish removal may indirectly reduce predation on this species as with other lutjanids.","This species is abundant, sizeable and important in many deeper water commercial, recreational and artisanal fisheries in its range.<br/><br/><strong>United States<br/></strong>Genetic differentiation of Vermilion Snapper in southeast U.S. waters and the Gulf of Mexico was so small that it is likely that only one stock of Vermilion Snapper occurs in U.S. waters (Bagley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). In Florida state waters, the majority of landings (80%) are in the Gulf of Mexico, with 64% of the statewide landings in the commercial sector (FWC 2014). Landings for this species in the US Gulf of Mexico were relatively low until the mid-1970s, when commercial landings increased every year until a peak in 1993 of approximately 1,200 mt, and then declined 33% by 1996. After 1996, there has been an overall increasing trend in commercial landings through 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014). Recreational landings increased through the 1980s, then declined by about 50% between 1992 and 1996; recreational landings have remained fairly stable with moderate increases since 1996 (Schirripa 2000, NMFS pers. comm 2014). In the southeast U.S., total biomass and spawning biomass both gradually declined during the 1950s and 1960s, then steeply declined during the mid-1970s through 1980s. The SEDAR 17 (2008) assessment indicated that F2007 for Vermilion Snapper in southeast U.S. waters exceeded MFMT (F2007/FMSY = 1.27), which indicates overfishing. Spawning biomass had remained above MSST (SSB2007/SSBMSY = 0.86) throughout the time series, indicating that the stock was not overfished in 2007. However, the SEDAR 17 update stock assessment (2012) suggested much uncertainty in the terminal estimate of South Atlantic U.S. Vermilion Snapper status. The stock in 2011 was estimated to be not overfished (SSB2011/SSBMSY = 0.98) and not undergoing overfishing (F2009-2011/FMSY = 0.67). Since the mid-1970s in the southeast US, there has been more than a 60% decline in total biomass (1975 - 2011); current biomass is estimated to be below BMSY (SEDAR 2012, see figure 19 on pg. 77). <u>In the South Atlantic, the estimated decline over three generation lengths is 20% over 18 years to 66% over 42 years (SEDAR 2012)</u>. It is not considered overfished or undergoing overfishing in the SAFMC. Discard mortality for <em>R. aurorubens</em>, inferred by the percentage of individuals that floated during a hook-and-line catch-and-release study, was 14-16% at depths of 36-54 m off the coast of South Carolina (Collins 2013). Based on summary information from FWC (2014), the SEDAR 9 (2006) assessment indicated that F2004 for the Gulf of Mexico Vermilion Snapper stock did not exceed MFMT (F2004/FMSY = 0.65). Spawning stock biomass was greater than MSST, and the SEDAR panel concluded the Gulf stock was not overfished at the beginning of 2005. The SEDAR 9 update stock assessment (2011) maintained that Gulf Vermilion Snapper stock was not overfished and was not experiencing overfishing through 2010. <u>Based on SEDAR 9 (2006), biomass in the Gulf of Mexico declined by 45% over the past 19 yrs and SSB by 33.5% over the past 24 yr (within an estimated range of three generation lengths of 18-42 years)</u>. A stock assessment for <em>R. aurorubens </em>that accounted for changes in shrimp trawl fishing effort, expected to change bycatch rates of <em>R. aurorubens</em>, suggested that the population was not overfished or experiencing overfishing in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico (Linton <em>et al.</em> 2011). It is not considered overfished or undergoing overfishing in the GMFMC. SEDAR 9 (2006) reports that <em>R. aurorubens</em> landings increased from 5.0 mt in 1955 to 1,061.2 mt in 2013 in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico combined.<br/><strong><br/>Mexico<br/></strong>Landings from Mexico from 2005-2011 suggest a 62% decline over seven years, dropping from 2,794 mt in 2005 to 1,062 mt in 2011 (FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Division 2011). Before 2005, this species was recorded as mixed-catch in Mexico<br/><br/><strong>Cuba<br/></strong>Landings of <em>R. aurorubens </em>are not available from Cuba, where this species is common, but is not heavily caught (R.

Regulations currently include a minimum size limit of 12 inches total length, gear restrictions, an Annual Catch Limit (ACL), and a recreational bag limit of five per person/day in addition to the aggregate 10 snapper allowed per recreational person/day. The recreational ACL was 412,480 lbs for entire year in 2015. The commercial ACL was 876,520 for 2015, with the ACL split into two seasons (438,260 for 1 January through 30 June, and an equal amount for 1 July through 31 December). The commercial and recreational sectors are also now required to use non-stainless steel circle hooks when fishing natural baits north of 28°N latitude and dehooking tools to reduce bycatch mortality. There is a 1,000-lbs. (gutted weight) trip limit for Vermilion Snapper (reduced to 500 lbs. since 75% of the quota has been met or projected to be met). Commercial snapper/grouper vessels must have onboard NMFS-approved sea turtle release gear and follow Smalltooth Sawfish release protocol. Several SAFMC marine protected areas that prohibit fishing for snapper/grouper species include preferred habitat and known spawning locations for Vermilion Snapper off South Carolina and Florida (Sedberry<em> et al. </em>2006). In the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Vermilion Snapper is managed through the Reef Fish FMP. Management measures for the recreational fishery include gear restrictions, special management zones, a minimum size limit of 10 inches total length for up to 10 Vermilion Snapper per person/day within the 20-fish reef fish aggregate recreational bag limit. Non-stainless steel circle hooks and dehooking devices are required. Vermilion Snapper may not be used as bait. For-hire recreational vessels must comply with the more restrictive of state or federal regulations when fishing in state waters. Commercial regulations include the 10-in total length minimum size. There are no commercial trip limits or ACLs in the Gulf of Mexico. Vermilion Snapper is also included in the FMP for the Shallow Water Reef Fish Fishery of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of Snapper Unit 1, along with Silk, Black and Blackfin Snapper. Management measures include gear restrictions and seasonal closures.

Reef-building corals are experiencing declines globally due to a variety of threats including increasing sea surface temperatures, increasing severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification. In south and southeast Asia 65% of coral reefs have been effectively lost and an average of 27% have been lost among north Asia, the southwest Pacific Islands, and the Polynesian Islands between 1988 - 2008 where <em>G. axillaris </em>occurs.&#160;In addition, of the reefs remaining in south and southeast Asia, 40% of them are at a critical stage with 22% and 17% of those in north Asia and the southwest Pacific Islands, respectively, also at a critical stage.&#160;Over the past 10 years, given the severity of local and regional threats to coral reef ecosystems, as well as the impact of ocean acidification and increasing warming events, the rate of decline has probably not changed. Since this species is reliant on coral reef habitats and cannot survive on bleached or algae covered corals, it is an appropriate proxy for species population estimates.&#160;This species has experienced an average coral decline (effectively lost reefs) of 46% across its range from 1988 - 2008 resulting an estimated decline in habitat of about 27% over the past 10 years (2008 - 2018). This documented decline approaches the criteria for a Vulnerable listing but given the likelihood of continued coral habitat decline in the regions where this species occurs in addition to the documented critical stage reefs, habitat decline over a 10 year timeframe spanning some past and some future, e.g. 2015-2025, probably exceeds 30%. Therefore&#160;<em>G.&#160;</em><em>axillaris</em><em>&#160;</em>is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A4c.</p>","<em>Gobiodon axillaris</em> is a marine, reef-associated, coral-commensal species (Harold <em>et al.</em> 2008), found occupying <em>Acropora</em> corals (Munday 2000). The maximum recorded length for this species is 5 cm. Adults mostly occupy <em>A. nasuta</em> and <em>A</em>. <em>millepora&#160;</em>(Munday&#160;1999). Gobies are generally short lived species and probably have a generation length of less than three years.","Reef-associated fish species, such as this one, have been documented to be particularly vulnerable to deleterious climatic changes (Comte and Olden 2017). This species appears to be associated only with particular species of <em>Acropora</em> corals. Reef-building corals are experiencing declines globally due to a variety of local and regional threats (Bruno and Selig 2007, Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008, Richards<em> et al.</em> 2008) including temperature extremes leading to bleaching and increased susceptibility to disease, increased severity of ENSO events and storms, and ocean acidification. Additionally,&#160;<em>Gobiodon </em>spp.&#160;do not survive on bleached or algae-covered corals (Sano <em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, H. Larson pers. comm. 2019).","Given that this species is a coral-commensal species, specifically on <em>Acropora</em> spp., coral habitat is used as a proxy for population data. This species prefers<em>&#160;A. millepora</em>, and&#160;<em>A. nasuta</em>&#160;as adults, which have declined by at least 20% across this species' range over three generation lengths (30 years) (Richards&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), and probably more when updated coral data are available.&#160;In south and southeast Asia 65% of coral reefs have been effectively lost and an average of 27% have been lost among north Asia, the southwest Pacific Islands, and the Polynesian Islands between 1988 - 2008 (Wilkinson 2008). In addition, of the reefs remaining in south and southeast Asia, 40% of them are at a critical stage (50-90% loss of corals and are likely to become effectively lost in 10-20 years) with 22% and 17% of those in north Asia and the southwest Pacific Islands, respectively, also at a critical stage (Wilkinson 2008). Over the past 10 years, given the severity of local and regional threats to coral reef ecosystems, as well as the impact of ocean acidification and increasing warming events, the rate of decline, about 1-2% per year in the Indo-Pacific since 1997 (Bruno and Selig 2007, Carpenter <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), has probably not changed.",Unknown,"<em>Gobiodon axillaris </em>is broadly distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, from the Red Sea and Socotra (Yemen), Lizard Island (Australia) (Munday <em>et al</em>. 1997, Harold <em>et al</em>. 2008), Malaysia, Papua New Guinea (Munday 2000), the Ryukus (Japan), the Marianas, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Fiji (H.

Overall, this species biomass decreased significantly from 1987-89 with virtually the same fishing effort; and from 1989-91 there was virtually no biomass recorded of triggerfishes in Ghanaian coastal waters. Some studies indicate that the fishery may have been under-exploited, with significant declines due to changes in environmental conditions. However, the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Balistes</span>    fishery has not revived in Ghana, and more research is needed on the impact of environmental changes on this species population.&#160;<br/><br/>Regardless, this species population has declined more than 99% in the Gulf of Guinea over the past 18-21 years (three generation lengths), which represents approximately one-third of its global range. Thus, overall population declines are inferred to be at least 30% over its entire range in the Eastern Central Atlantic. This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable under A2bd. It is highly recommended that population estimates and environmental conditions be reassessed throughout a wider parts of its range to confirm that this species is not more highly threatened.","This species inhabits sandy and rocky bottom areas in coastal waters. The Fridtjof Nansen survey in 2005 in the western Gulf of Guinea caught this species in waters from Côte d’Ivoire to Benin, at depths of &#160;22 to 32 m.

Since the early 1970s, FAO annual catches of triggerfish in the Eastern Central Atlantic show two separate peaks between 1972 and 2003. The first catch peak (12,563 tons) occurred in 1979, and the second peak (17,250 tons) in 1986/87. Before 1979, triggerfish catch levels fluctuated from 2,830 tons (1972) to 9,138 tons (1977). In between 1979 and 1986/87, triggerfish catch fell to ‘regular or stable’ annual levels (c. 5,000-8,000 tons/year). However, triggerfish catch experienced a ‘sharp’ decline in 1988 to 2,862 tons and continued to decline to date with less than 0.5 tonnes reported in 2009 (FAO FishStat). Catch effort relationships available from 1972-1991,&#160;indicate that inshore triggerfish catches generally increased with inshore effort. Inshore catch decreased dramatically from 1979-80 with relatively similar fishing effort and continued to decrease until 1980-84, catches increased in 1984-1986 with increased effort and then decreased progressively with effort from 1987-91 (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). Overall, triggerfish biomass was highest in 1985 and then has steadily decreased until 1991 and to present. The biomass decrease was quite significant from 1987-89 at virtually the same effort; and 1989-91 there was virtually no biomass of the triggerfish resource in Ghanaian coastal waters&#160;(Koranteng 1998, Aggrey-Fynn 2007).<br/><br/>  Historically, there is evidence of triggerfish exploitations in the early  1980s. FAO reported catches from the Soviet Union from fishing divisions deployed in Cape Verde, Sahara and Sherbro also show declines from 1970-1989. In the early 1980s, catches reported from Ghana were closer to the optimum fishing level, and there was no strong evidence that exploitation of triggerfish might have contributed significantly in the sudden collapse of the triggerfish resource in Ghana  and the entire western Gulf of Guinea in the late 1980s. There is no previous report on mortality (M) for blue-spotted triggerfish, however Aggrey-Fynn (2007) have since estimated M = 0.8615. Although  current exploitation rates show an  under-exploited fishery, the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Balistes</span>   fishery has not revived in Ghana, which could be attributed to local   environmental factors. These environmental factors include the intense cooling along the coast of Ghana in   recent years and triggerfish migration from cold coastal waters to warm   offshore waters, and the unusual minimum mean temperatures experienced   in 1979 and 1987 that have not been recorded again in coastal waters of   Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>In 1979-1980, the demersal component of triggerfish assessed in bottom trawl surveys was 99,000 t (or 57.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), or 62% of the total demersal fish biomass in Ghanian coastal waters (Koranteng and Pauly 2002).

Data on population decline are available from only a few locations, despite the expansive geographic range. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and   modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%   of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between 1977 and the late 1990s. Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its range.&#160; In addition, although data on population decline is limited, this species may be closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Valiela <em>et al.</em>(2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year.&#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined  global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5  years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific,  where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened  (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places  (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago  is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove  loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since  1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses  are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are  experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the  northern-most part of <em>A. glossodonta</em>'s range, 22% of all seagrass  species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines  (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,   we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range  will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. In addition, the recreational fishery is not well-established in the Indo-Pacific region, so there is little economic incentive for conservation; we do not expect conservation to be occurring at present. Therefore, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths in the past (13.5 years), with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to the global conservation of this species are uncertainties about population connectivity and taxonomic resolution.

Maximum age recorded is 11 years&#160; (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Sex ratio varies widely across its distribution (1 to 1.25 in a study by Friedlander and 1–6.75 in another (Beets 2000). Although minimum size and age at maturity is not known, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula</span> sp.  reared in the lab were sexually mature at two and three years of age (Pfeiler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Using equation number five of section 4.4 of the Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Working Group 2008), if generation length = age of first reproduction + z*(length of the reproductive period), and age at first reproduction is estimated at 2.5 years, z is estimated to be 0.5 based on survivorship and relative fecundity with age, and the length of the reproductive period is estimated at 8.5 years, then generation length is estimated to be 4.5 years.<br/><br/>This species primarily feeds on crustaceans, including mantis shrimps and crab, also polychaetes, bivalves and amphipods (Friedlander 1997). Crustaceans comprised more than 50% of the diet in a Hawaiian study (Friedlander 1997).<br/><br/>Natural mortality from sharks is very high at Palmyra Atoll (Adams pers. comm. 2011). The maximum size for this species is 90 cm (SL) (Myers 1991).","Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have decreased dramatically  over the past few decades, presumably because of overfishing and loss of  habitat, from over 300,000lbs in 1900 to less than 3,000lbs.  since 2002. Bonefish were the most important species in the commercial seine  fishery between 1966 and 1970, with average annual yields of nearly  18,000 pounds. Although the presence of multiple species within the  fishery makes species-specific declines hard to pinpoint, the commercial  seine catch now averages only 581lbs per year, accounting for less  than 8% of the catch. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over  136.4 mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes  all   bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy fishing pressure and degradation of habitats at Tarawa and Kiritimati Atolls  have resulted in the loss of pre-spawning staging sites and spawning  migration routes, which may be responsible for the observed declines in  bonefish catches, average size, and sex ratios at these locations (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). There are declines in CPUE, mean length and weight of fish and also a change in sex ratio (Beets 2000). Sex ratio (F:M) was 0.71:1 in 1977 and in 1992–1993 it was recorded as 0.15:1. In 1977, mean length was 46.4 cm and mean weight was 1.3 kg. In 1992, mean length recorded was 37.6 cm and mean weight was 0.84 kg. There was a decrease in the smallest size of sexually mature individuals between the two time periods: in 1977 the smallest size of sexually mature males was 42.5 cm&#160; and 46.5 cm for females; in 1992 is was 32 cm for males and 35 cm for females. In addition, Beets (2000) conservatively estimates that the 30% of total catch was non-reproductive. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6% of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). The effects of catch-and-release fishing on this species are unclear.<br/><br/>Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also  accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and  disruption of prey species dynamics. Fishing and habitat loss and degradation may pose the most significant threats to this species. Disruptions to shallow  coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses and mangroves due to climate  change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly  in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and  urbanization. <br/><br/>The limited range of this species may  also make it vulnerable to local threats, such as habitat loss  (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). It has been noted that habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss may contribute to the  decline in abundance of this species in Tarawa (Beets 2000). Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves,seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic  declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001, Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely  throughout its range. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001) estimates that mangroves have  decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year. Since bonefish rely upon habitats of  limited extent, they are especially susceptible to habitat loss and  degradation, particularly due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often fragmented in nature, exacerbating this  issue. As with other coastal species, fragmentation will likely have  direct and indirect negative impacts on bonefish.","As multiple species within the genus are morphologically  indistinguishable, there is limited species-specific information  available on population status. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over 136.4  mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes all  bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). A recreational fishing guide on Oahu indicated that although netting of  bonefish continues, it is not as prevalent as it once was (Adams pers.  comm. 2011). It is therefore unclear whether the decline in landings is due to a change in effort or a true change in population size. Capture of recruits (CPUE) of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula </span>spp. in Kahana, Hawaii was highest in 1999 and has declined by 79% since that time (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is rare in Mauritius (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and  modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%  of the total catch; in 1992, they were 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). A survey from the Fisheries Division of Kiribati conducted in 1995 shows  that bonefish was the second-most common species caught, accounting for 7% of  total catch. Gill nets caught 82% of the bonefish, with handlines  providing the remainder (18%) of the catch (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant  declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between  1977 and the late 1990s. The annual take of bonefish from Tarawa Lagoon  is between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 fish per year, but no stock  assessment has been conducted (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). This species is probably the most abundant molluscivorous fish in the lagoon (Beets 2001). Comparison data from fished and protected locations at Palmyra Atoll   show significant differences in population characteristics which may   indicate that threats are expressed asymmetrically across its range   (Adams pers. comm. 2011).&#160; Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in  areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves  as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its  range. In addition, the recreational fishery is not  well-established in the Indo-Pacific, so there is little economic incentive for  conservation.&#160; Therefore, we do  not expect conservation to be occurring at  present.<br/><br/>Like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, <em>A. glossodonta</em>&#160; may be  closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other   shallow  coastal habitats. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al.</span> (2001)  estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a  rate of  2% per year. &#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5 years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific, where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the northern-most part of A. glossodonta's range, 22% of all seagrass species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,  we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. <br/><br/>Given population declines of at least 30%&#160; over three generation lengths at Tarawa, significant habitat loss throughout much of its range, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths (13.5 years),  with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific.",Decreasing,"<p>The Shortjaw Bonefish occurs from Hawaii and French Polynesia to the Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, north to southern Japan and south to Lord Howe Island, Australia.

It is sporadically distributed throughout its range and the overall population size is unknown. Due to the lack of sampling effort, it is likely to be more common than existing records suggest. Since the species is restricted to shallow marshes that are patchily distributed across this area, its area of occupancy (AOO) is likely less than 2,000 km². It is suspected that there have been significant population declines and population fragmentation over the last 10 years due to hardened shorelines, decreased freshwater flows into marshes, and marsh wetland loss, but there are no quantitative data available to confirm this decline or to determine the size of the reduction. <br/><br/>This fish is known to inhabit at least three natural reserves within its distribution. There are also ongoing programs focused on the restoration of its habitat, but success of these programs has not yet been determined.

It inhabits estuaries, coastal salt marshes, and back-water sloughs. It occurs most abundantly in shallow, tidal <em>Spartina</em> cordgrass marshes and <em>Juncus </em>rush salt marshes and often schools in large numbers in the freshwater fringe of saltwater marshes (0-28 psu) (Thompson 1980, H. Jelks pers. comm. 2014). It likely feeds on small invertebrates (NOAA NOS 2009). Its maximum size is 6.5 cm TL (Robins and Ray 1986). It exhibits sexual dimorphism in body length, with females larger than males by a quarter to one-half of an inch (NOAA NOS 2009). It reproduces by internal fertilization via an elongate contact organ structure located on the anal fun of the males. Spawning occurs between March to August in shallow, flooded marsh areas. Females exhibit asynchronous oocyte development and have the ability to spawn over successive days, which is further supported by the presence of multiple oocyte stages (Lang <em>et al</em>. 2012). Size at first maturity for males is estimated to be ~2.1 cm. Larvae are usually seen in May and June and juveniles appear in July (Thompson 1999). Its average lifespan in the wild is 2-3 years (NOAA NOS 2009).","This species is dependent on a specific salinity range within coastal salt marshes with small interconnected intertidal creeks, a habitat that is being altered due to development throughout its restricted range (Lopez <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is highly susceptible to coastal development and hardening of shorelines (habitat alteration/destruction) and pollution.<br/><br/>In Louisiana, flooded marsh areas that provide important feeding, shelter, and breeding areas for this species are being destroyed by coastal erosion due to subsidence. This is a major problem throughout the lower Mississippi River delta system and on several barrier islands around Louisiana. Some areas where this species has been collected in that past have been eliminated by coastal erosion. <br/><br/>In addition to natural erosion, disposal of dredged materials along the coast will also lead to a loss or reduction of flooded areas (Schmitt and Chiappone 2012). As erosion causes further habitat loss and fragmentation, genetic diversity of this species is at risk because significant genetic mixing of separated populations is not likely to occur (Poss 1999). Population decline due to pollution and habitat loss is unknown, but likely and estimated to be &lt;30% over 10 years or three generations (Schmitt and Chiappone 2012).","The overall population size is unknown for this species.

It is most common between southeastern Louisiana and Florida (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980). Simpson and Gunter (1956) recorded this species as the rarest cyprinodontid collected among sixty stations from the Rio Grande, Texas to the Sabine River, Louisiana (400 miles). More up-to-date collection records are needed. It is consistently represented in collections from Louisiana following the 2010 oil spill (Jordan pers. comm. 2014).

The particular river habitats and catchment position that this species prefers are also the ones that are under increasing levels of water abstraction pressure in many areas. Other threats include land use changes that cause increased sedimentation of interstitial spaces in the river substrate and artificial barriers to migration that are present in many parts of this species' range. Analysis of New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) data show a decline in the national presence/absence records of this species from 9% in 2001 to 5.8% in 2011, which is considered to provide an appropriate indication of overall population trend. This continues an apparent decline in presence/absence reporting in the NZFFD since the early 1990s and the five year rolling average of occurrence from 2005-2011 (the most recent data available) in the NZFFD is the lowest on record. This species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable based on an inferred overall population decline of at least 30% over the past 10 years. Continual decline in area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) and habitat quality is expected into the future leading to further population declines. Future rate of decline is expected to be unpredictable due to the widespread but fragmented nature of the population of this species, meaning threats and freshwater management will have a significant, but as yet unknown influence on the decline rate.","This species&#160;is mostly found in low altitude rivers, close to the coast.

David pers. comm. 2014).&#160;This species is considered obligately amphidromous. Adults are thought to spawn once a year in the spring. Males establish a territory beneath a rock where the female deposits eggs in a single layer. The male fertilises the eggs, which he then guards until hatching. Larvae rear at sea and small juveniles return to freshwater after several months (at a size of about 20mm) and migrate upstream (Atkinson and Joy 2009). The maximum total length is up to 93 mm.

The estimated generation time is 2-3 years.&#160;Although no complete population information is available for&#160;<em>Cheimarricthys fosteri</em>, it is considered that there has been a significant population decline of this species over the past ten years. Presence/absence records from the national New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) for the decades 1960-69, 1970-79, 1980-89, 1990-99 were assessed. A second analysis was carried out to eliminate method bias, using only electric fishing records to remove any effect of an increase in use of spotlighting, trapping or netting. A third analysis of the data was aimed at reducing the effect of inland distance and altitude and removed all records over 100 m and using just electric fishing records. All three analyses showed exactly the same trend that the decade from 2000-09 had 50% less&#160;<em>C. fosteri&#160;</em>than that of any of the preceding four decades. Additionally, data collected from the Manawatu River show that the number of sites where this species occurs has declined by about 50% and the number of specimens caught at these sites has also declined. The area fished is not available for all sites, but from the sites that do have these data available, it appears that the average area fished is the same for during the 1990s and 2000s, or has increased even as the catch rate has dropped. According to the New Zealand Department of Conservation's threat classification system, this species is nationally assessed as 'At risk - declining - C(1/1)', which is based on a large population but with an ongoing or predicated decline of 10-70%.&#160;The primary threats to this species include barriers to upstream migration, habitat loss through water abstraction and land&#160;use changes causing habitat degradation throughout much of this species range.&#160;Additionally, considering long-term climate trends and water abstraction pressures, the availability of fast-flowing water for this very habitat specific species will likely to continue to decline. Considering analysis of data from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database and findings of long-term site-specific research, it is considered reasonable to infer there has been at least a 30% population decline over the last ten years, with a continuing reduction in area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) and habitat quality, therefore this species has been assessed as Vulnerable. This is considered a reserved assessment and it is suspected that if actual population trend data were available, it may reveal a greater rate of decline, quite likely to exceed 50% over the past ten years, which would justify this species being assessed as Endangered.","This species<em>&#160;</em>is considered obligately amphidromous.&#160;Spawning sites have not been formally described but aggregations of ripe females in lower river reaches have been documented.&#160;This species is found in fast flowing gravelly rivers, often occupying the fastest flowing areas particularly in riffles, rapids and torrents (McDowall 2000).

Adults probably spawn once a year in summer or autumn. Larvae rear at sea and small juveniles return to freshwater when they reach a size of 16-20 mm in spring or summer.","This species is a poor climber and therefore barriers to upstream migration limit inland penetration in many river systems throughout this species' range (Tana 2009). Habitat loss through water abstraction and land&#160;use changes causing increased sedimentation of interstitial spaces in the river substrate are also threats to this species. Additionally, considering long-term climate trends and water abstraction pressures, the availability of fast-flowing water for this very habitat-specific species will probably continue to decline.","Although no complete population information is available for this species, it is considered that there has been a significant population decline over the past ten years (R. Allibone pers. comm. 2014). Presence/absence records from the national New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) for the decades 1960-69, 1970-79, 1980-89 and 1990-99 were assessed. A second analysis was carried out to eliminate method bias, using only electric fishing records to remove any effect of an increase in use of spotlighting, trapping or netting. A third analysis of the data was aimed at reducing the effect of inland distance and altitude and removed all records over 100 m and using just electric fishing records. All three analyses showed exactly the same trend that the decade from 2000-09 had 50% less&#160;<em>C. fosteri </em>than that of any of the preceding four decades (Allibone <em>et al.</em> 2009; R. Allibone pers. comm. 2014). Additionally, data collected from the Manawatu River show that the number of sites where this species occurs has declined by about 50% and the number of specimens caught at these sites has also declined. The area fished is not available for all sites, but from the sites that do have these data available, it appears that the average area fished is the same for during the 1990s and 2000s, or has increased even as the catch rate has dropped (R. Allibone pers. comm. 2014). According to the New Zealand Department of Conservation's threat classification system, this species is nationally assessed as 'At risk - declining - C(1/1)', which is based on a large population but with an ongoing or predicated decline of 10-70% (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Decreasing,"The Torrentfish (<em>Cheimarrichthys fosteri</em>) is endemic to New Zealand where it is found in areas of suitable habitat in both the North and South Island. It has not been recorded on Stewart or Chatham Islands (McDowall 2000). Upstream / inland penetration in river systems is substantial and this species is known to occur at 700 m elevation and 289 km upstream from the sea. High elevation is typically achieved only at relatively short distances inland, whereas long inland penetration is achieved typically only in low-gradient river systems (Tana 2009). Sparse distribution in some areas, particularly in eastern New Zealand may be due in part to absence or sparseness of riverine gravels. Absence from other areas, such as around Cook and Foveaux straits, the Marlborough Sounds, Fiordland and Stewart and Chatham Islands, may result from oceanographic conditions that do not favour return to rivers of the marine living juveniles (Tana 2009). Ecological and behavioural variables relating to the marine life intervals are the predominating factors influencing distribution and historical influences are of minor importance (Tana 2009).",This species is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,There are no targeted conservation actions in place for this species.,Australasian,,false,false,Global

Eggs sink and adhere to objects on the bottom (Scott and Crossman 1973); after a few hours the eggs unstick and drift downstream (Dadswell 1980). Larvae occur in or slightly downstream from spawning areas; juveniles may exhibit net upstream movement until emigration from freshwater in summer or fall (or, in some areas, the next spring) (Fay et al. 1983).

This species is a desirable foodfish in India, although not directly targeted. Instead, it is taken in mixed-species demersal trawl fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. Historically, national landings of tonguesoles were reported in aggregate until 2007, when efforts were made to begin reporting landings by species, at least for the common species, such as Malabar Sole.&#160;Therefore, reliable population size and trend data are not directly available for Malabaar Sole prior to 2007. Historically, this species constituted a major component of the total flatfish landings, often representing more than 80% of the total catch of flatfishes. Since 2007, landings reported as <em>C. macrostomus</em> at the national level increased continually to 2012-2013, followed by a rapid decline to less than 20% of maximum landings. Similar declines were also documented in Indian waters for other species (such as sardines and other small pelagics); however, the causes of these declines have been variously attributed to population collapses (due to overexploitation or climatological factors) and to changes in fishing patterns and practices. Simultaneously, mechanized fishing effort, which is efficient at demersal trawling, increased over this time period and likely resulted in increased fishing pressure on this species. Exploitation ratios for this species are typically high; therefore, research is needed to clarify trends in fishing practices to determine changes in effort and whether landing declines can be attributed to population declines. Although mechanized fishing effort, which is efficient at demersal trawling, increased between 1985 and 2011, effort data for the past 10 years are not available. As such, it is difficult to definitively attribute these declines in landings to declines in population size. However,&#160;this species is a desirable foodfish in India, and at least some of the decline in landings in recent years is probably&#160;attributable to a decline in population size.

Sudden increases in catches along the Kerala coast suggest large scale movements of these fishes following the monsoon season (Khan and Nandakumaran 1993, Jayaprakash 2000, Nair 2007). These movements are partly correlated with cyclical patterns of productivity and intensity of detritus, and settlement of food organisms to the benthos in inshore waters <span style="""">(Munroe 2015)</span>.

2780880,22003,Totoaba macdonaldi,Vulnerable,A4bd,2021,2020-08-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This demersal, migratory species is endemic to the Gulf of California, Mexico. It inhabits coastal areas and is dependent on shallow water in the Upper Gulf for spawning and nursery habitat. This region has been altered by the damming of the Colorado River in the 1930s, resulting in increased salinity. The estimated generation length is about 12 years. A variety of intrinsic characteristics (e.g. late-maturing, long-lived, predictable spawning behaviour in a relatively small area) make it particularly susceptible to overfishing. An important extrinsic factor, the extremely high economic value of the swim bladder of the species, is a major incentive to catch this species for swim bladder extraction and export. This market pressure is ongoing, if not increasing, and is facilitated by a lack of effective surveillance and law enforcement in the region. Although the legal fishery was closed in 1975 due to concerns about overexploitation, there has been an exponential increase in poaching driven by illegal trade in its swim bladder to China since 2011. Poaching is highest in the Upper Gulf spawning grounds, with the preferred gear being gillnet, and has extended south to the archipelago during the non-spawning season. The capture as bycatch&#160;of the Critically Endangered Vaquita Porpoise (<em>Phocoena sinus</em>) in these gillnets&#160;has driven this endemic marine mammal&#160;to the brink of extinction.<br/><br/>There are no estimates of Totoaba population size (defined as number of mature individuals&#160;according to the IUCN Red List Guidelines). Estimates of effective population size are available, ranging from around 2,000–11,000 breeding adults, but this cannot be applied as an estimate of the population size per the Red List Guidelines. There is some evidence from genetic diversity and age-size structure of samples that suggests population stability. From 2015–2019, nearly 700,000 captive-bred juvenile Totoaba individuals were released into the wild to support population recovery, but further study is needed to understand the impact of these releases. Several studies have modelled potential biomass trajectories based on historical commercial catches and more recent estimates of illegal catch to evaluate different management scenarios and the level of effective protection. However, the models are not fitted to available data but rather driven by assumptions about population depletion, so they are not appropriate to apply to a Red List categorization, nor to construct an index of mature individuals.<br/><br/>Therefore, we used poaching severity as the basis for this Red List assessment. A precautionary approach is taken here for three reasons: 1) the species has been subject to sharply increased rates of poaching targeting large adult Totoaba for approximately one generation (since the early 2010s) despite legal protection and increased enforcement; 2) given the ineffectiveness thus far of these measures, it is plausible that poaching pressure will continue and 3) there is ongoing, if not growing interest to source the swim bladder of this species for illegal trade.<br/><br/>We suspect a past and future three-generation decline (1993–2029) of at least 30% based on the following:&#160;<br/><br/>1) Estimated annual removals of adult individuals by poaching increased five-fold from approximately 6,000 individuals in&#160;the mid-1980s to 30,000 individuals by 2017; although, there is some uncertainty associated with these estimates.<br/>2) The total mortality rate of Totoaba increased from the mid-1980s to 1991–1993 due to a sharp increase in poaching during that period. While declines may have started in the mid-1980s we have a higher level of confidence in the data that indicate declines starting in the early 1990s.<br/>3)	In the Upper Gulf spawning grounds where Totoaba aggregate in winter-spring, there has been a 99% decline since 2011 in the sympatric Vaquita Porpoise population due to incidental capture in illegal gillnets targeting Totoaba. Given that gillnet poachers search for and target Totoaba aggregations, it is plausible that a steep decline may have also occurred in the Totoaba population during the same period.<br/>4)	Annual average seizures of illegal Totoaba swim bladders have increased by five-fold from just over 500 per year in 2013–2017 to over 2,300 per year in 2018–2020. These numbers represent only a portion of the illegal trade, and are therefore inferred to be underestimates.<br/>5) Targeted poaching of Totoaba&#160;is also evident in net removal statistics, with over 1,200 illegal large-mesh gillnets removed from the Upper Gulf spawning area from 2016 to 2020.&#160;<br/>Therefore, primarily based on the level of exploitation, this species is assessed as Vulnerable under criteria A4bcd. Given that there are inconsistencies in the available data, with evidence of increased poaching pressure countered by other indications of population resilience, and no direct measures of population trend, this assessment should be updated when additional data allow for a better understanding of this species’ status, especially since declines are expected to continue in the near future due to the ongoing high poaching rate. The change in status from the previous assessment is non-genuine and reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as improved availability of data.<br/><br/>The most urgent conservation need is to stop illegal fishing and trafficking of swim bladders. Conservation measures that have reduced fishing by the commercial fleet and provided protections of the spawning ground should remain in place. Improvements in fishery data collection are needed as well as research on the efficacy of the released cultivated juveniles to increase wild stock.","This demersal species occurs on soft bottoms in coastal areas from brackish to marine waters. Adults have also been reported in in the northern and southeastern Gulf of California in rocky reef areas. Adults migrate to the Colorado River Delta to form spawning aggregations in winter/spring. Early juveniles utilize brackish waters/estuaries as nursery habitat. Immature individuals remain in the delta for up to three years before migrating south and returning to the delta for spawning the following year. Currently, this is the only confirmed spawning site, but additional research is needed to investigate other potential sites (M.A. Cisneros-Mata pers. comm. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Variability of the Totoaba population growth rate is very sensitive to survival of pre-adults and adults (i.e. individuals older than five years) (Cisneros-Mata <em>et al.</em> 1997). However, there is no direct evidence that the Totoaba population has been reduced by the damming of the Colorado River. The maximum reported length is about 200 cm and maximum weight is 135 kg, although due to present overfishing, it is now rarely captured at this size (Cisneros-Mata 2020a). It primarily consumes fish and shrimp species.&#160;<br/><br/>Age at first maturity is about six years for males and seven years for females; longevity is 27 years and the estimated natural mortality rate is 0.26/year (Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 1995, Cisneros-Mata 2020a).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is 11.94 years. This was calculated using survivorship and per capita recruitment rate data from Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (1997) and the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods:&#160;<br/><br/>G = Σ x lx mx / Σ lx mx","Overfishing is the primary major threat to this species (Márquez-Farías and Rosales-Juárez 2013, Cisneros-Mata 2020a). A large commercial fishery caused initial historical declines, though this fishery has been banned since 1975. The current threat is increased illegal fishing to supply swim bladders that are in high demand in the illegal Chinese market. Poaching is highest in the Upper Gulf spawning grounds, with the preferred gear being large-mesh (10–12 inch) gillnets, operated both passively and actively and has has extended south to the archipelago during the non-spawning season.<br/><br/>Heavy alteration of the Colorado River delta in the Upper Gulf of California due to upstream freshwater diversion by dams has resulted in its classification as a “negative estuary” (salinity levels are higher, rather than lower as they would be with freshwater inputs), impacting the only known habitat for spawning and growth of early Totoaba juveniles. Adult Totoaba migrate to this area and concentrate there for spawning in winter/spring, and juveniles remain there for up to three years. Totoaba are still able to spawn there, and the effect of increasing salinity on the Totoaba population is unclear, but recent studies indicate the species has been able to adapt to this environmental shift on some level (Cisneros-Mata&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020c, L. Enriquez and C. True pers. comm. 2021).","<p>This species sustained an important&#160;commercial&#160;fishery from 1924 to 1975 with catches exceeding 2,100 metric tons (t) annually in the 1940s. Fishers captured particularly large amounts by targeting the annual spawning migration in the Colorado River Delta and Upper Gulf of California. Catches declined by over 97% to less than 100 t per year by the 1970s (Rosales-Juárez and&#160;Ramírez-González 1987). Annual catch peaked in 1942 at 2,261&#160;t, and despite intensified fishing effort, the annual catch fluctuated erratically and declined to approximately 59&#160;t&#160;by 1975. A fishing ban was implemented in 1975 to reduce pressure on the Totoaba (Government of Mexico 1975, Bobadilla <em>et al</em>. 2011). Modelling by Lercari and Chavez (2007) suggests the population was over-exploited during the last 20 years of the legal fishery, and it is likely that a population collapse occurred, although they attribute additional environmental factors.<br/><br/>The commercial Totoaba fishery started in the 1920s to harvest the fish for its swim bladder, which was dried and exported to China as a delicacy, but a commercial meat trade to the United States soon developed and became the primary driver of the legal fishery from the 1940s to the 1970s (Cisneros-Mata&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1995). From the 1980s to about 2010, Totoaba poaching was mainly for local meat consumption (Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (1995) estimated that 6,218 adult Totoaba were poached annually in the mid-1980s in the Upper Gulf. Structured interviews with fishermen in the Upper Gulf found that most considered Totoaba biomass medium to high in the 1980s, but low in the early 2000s (Ainsworth 2011). While declines may have started in the 1980s, we have a higher level of confidence in data from Pedrín-Osuna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001) that indicate declines starting in the 1990s.&#160;Age series modeling by Pedrín-Osuna <em>et al.</em> (2001) found the mid-1980s to be a relatively low period of mortality, but it increased sharply from 1991 until by 1993 total mortality (from illegal capture, primarily) was almost quintuple that of natural mortality, and that the stock was over-exploited.<br/><br/>In the early 2010s, the swim bladder trade re-emerged, with Chinese traders willing to pay extremely high prices (see Trade section) for dried Totoaba swim bladders (EIA 2016), which uniquely resemble those of a native sciaenid fish <em>Bahaba taipingensis&#160;</em>(Sasaki 1989)<em>&#160;</em>fished to the verge of extinction for the swim bladder market (Sadovy and Cheung 2003). This black-market trade is driving the Vaquita Porpoise (<em>Phocoena sinus</em>, CR) rapidly toward extinction due to bycatch in the large-mesh bottom-set gillnets used to poach Totoaba in the Upper Gulf of California (Jaramillo-Legoretta <em>et al.</em> 2019), and is the primary threat to the Totoaba population (Cisneros-Mata 2020b). In the Upper Gulf spawning grounds where Totoaba concentrate in winter-spring, there has been a 99% decline since 2011 in the sympatric Vaquita Porpoise population. The Vaquita is likely more vulnerable to declines caused by these nets, not only because of its very small population (estimated at nine individuals in 2019), but also because the nets likely entangle animals of all ages, whereas only large-sized Totoaba are caught. However, poachers search for and target locations of schooling Totoaba, so it is plausible that their nets are at least half as effective at driving a decline in the Totoaba population over the same period.<br/><br/>Based on Totoaba individuals sampled in the early 2010s, Valenzuela-Quiñonez <em>et al</em>. (2015, 2016) and Rodríguez-García <em>et al</em>. (2020) concluded that the population displayed characteristics of stability based on analysis of age structure, genetic diversity, and presence throughout its historical range with some evident expansion to the south. An ongoing analysis of nearly 3,200 Totoaba swim bladders seized by Mexican authorities from 2013–2020 is yielding similar findings (L. Enriquez and C. True unpublished data 2021). The population may have benefited from the release of nearly 700,000 juveniles from captive breeding facilities in recent years (Jimenez-Esquivel and Domínguez-Sánchez 2020), although this remains to be confirmed by an ongoing genetic traceability study (L. Enriquez and C. True pers. comm. 2021). However, poaching in the Upper Gulf spawning ground represents a significant ongoing threat. Analysis of carcass dumps found onshore in the Upper Gulf during the 2016–2017 spawning period (poachers often slice out the swim bladder and dump the remainder of the carcass in the desert, although the meat is also eaten and sold) showed relatively few of the older, largest sized fish, which are most sought after by poachers. This was also reflected by these researchers’ interviews with poachers, who said that in 2018, catching Totoabas of a size necessary for the prized weight of a swim bladder over 1 kg (fresh weight) had become increasingly rare (Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The presence of older adults in the population is considered important for reproductive viability (Cisernos-Mata 2020b). However, analyses of recently seized swim bladder indicate that the seemingly low occurrence of large individuals may be expected in the age structure of this population (L. Enriquez and C. True unpublished data 2021).<br/><br/>While both larval counts and biomass estimates obtained by insonification of schooling fish can be inaccurate, recent independent surveys in the Upper Gulf both reported steep declines over just one year (2017 to 2018): larval counts declined by 40%, and maximum larval abundance declined by 75% from 15.3 larvae per 10 square metres to 4.1/10 m<sup>2</sup>, despite increased search effort (Guevara-Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2020). In addition, estimated biomass declined by 45% over the same period, from 36,429 t in 2017 to 19,294 t in 2018 (Nevárez-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2020). While the larval decrease could be due to environmental factors (a significant decrease was observed in chlorophyll, suggesting possible reduced primary productivity), poaching pressure on spawners could not be ruled out (Cisneros-Mata 2020b).<br/><br/>Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020a) estimated that 29,680 adult individuals of Totoaba were poached for their swim bladders in 2017, a five-fold increase in estimated poaching over three generations, and noted that this could be an underestimate as subsequent information indicated that more fishing boats were active than originally estimated (the calculation was based on a range of 5 to 50 active boats per month during the spawning season). Cisneros-Mata (2020b) later wrote “In recent confidential communications (2019) we were informed that the number of vessels engaged in the capture of adult Totoaba easily exceeded 100” (moreover, bycatch in abandoned fishing nets was also not taken into account). In addition, an outbreak of Totoaba poaching was reported to the south in 2020 in Bahia de Los Angeles (Anon. 2020 and ProNatura Noroeste pers. comm.); Totoaba poaching in that area was previously noted by Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020a), and it is possible that Totoaba are poached throughout their distributional area, although levels have only been estimated in the spawning grounds. From 2013–2020, nearly 10,000 swim bladders were seized by authorities in Mexico, China and Hong Kong and the United States (EIA 2020, see details in Supplemental Information). The highest totals were in 2018–2020 (average 2,347 annually) compared to the five previous years 2013–2017 (average 521 annually). Almost all these seizures were the result of random inspections. Intelligence-led investigation is more indicative of the true trade volume: in 2019, China indicted 11 men accused of trafficking more than 20,000 swim bladders from Mexico over at least a four-year period (2019–2018, 2018–2017, 2017–2016 and 2016–2015 Totoaba illegal fishing seasons). A public-private programme has removed over 1,200 Totoaba gillnets from the Upper Gulf of California from 2016–2020 (unpublished information from the Programa de Eliminación de Redes en el Alto Golfo de California, see Supplemental Information), totalling over 200,000 m<sup>2</sup> of illegal large-mesh gillnets (SSCS 2019a). Although net removals were highest in 2017–2018 (averaging 443 annually), and declined in 2019–2020 to an average of around 150 annually, it is evident that Totoaba poachers have expanded their range of fishing methods: they do not consistently leave their expensive passive gillnets unattended as in the past, but now also sometimes remain near them to defend them from net removal teams. In addition, net removal operations were reduced in these years due to these attacks (2019) as well as withdrawal during the COVID19 pandemic (2020), so the decrease in net removals does not appear to indicate a decline in poaching effort.<br/><br/>Since the closure of the commercial fishery in 1975, there are no reliable estimates of the size and trend of the Totoaba population (Valenzuela-Quiñonez <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 2020b, Rodríguez-García <em>et al</em>. 2020). Two separate studies that were not yet published in peer-reviewed format at the time of this Red List assessment, modelled potential trends in abundance (in tons of biomass) based on estimates of illegal catch of adults and juvenile bycatch in shrimp trawl nets following the methodology of Martell and Froese (2013) as a starting point. Each calculated the Limit Reference Point (LRP) biomass, below which the population is in danger of being over-exploited, differently: Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020b) defined it as 12,136 t and Espino-Leal <em>et al</em>. (2018) as 18,771 t. In 2017, the former predicted that the population would be above LRP, whereas the latter predicted it to be below. Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020a) also estimate potential 2017 biomass from their estimated 2017 poaching rate of approximately 30,000 adults; this has a high level of uncertainty associated with sampling bias (estimates of the size and weight of illegally caught Totoaba). Their catch rate-based biomass estimates were 15,077 t and 8,478 t for 2017 (one above and one below the LRP designated by Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 2020b), and Cisneros-Mata (2020b) noted biomass could be as low as 4,400 or 6,000 t if the catch rate was underestimated. Reconciling differences between the biomass estimated by different methods is not currently possible (Cisneros-Mata 2020b), nor can they be readily converted to population estimates given uncertainty concerning average weights and age structure.<br/><br/>It should be noted that, in the past, Totoaba population recovery prospects have been predicated upon adequate legal protection from illegal fishing. For example, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (1995) wrote that, “The recently declared biosphere reserve, which includes the uppermost region of the Gulf, may give the Totoaba and other endangered species in this unique region another chance, but only if enforcement of the fishing ban is successful.”&#160; Márquez-Farías and Rosales-Juárez (2013) found that the intrinsic rebound potential of the species is low (<em>r</em><sub>2<em>M</em></sub>&#160;=&#160;0.055), even assuming complete effectiveness of the fishing ban. Cisneros-Mata (2020b) stated that since 1975 “no measures or instruments have been effective,” and urged that “the most feasible alternative for the viability of Totoaba is to stop the illegal capture of reproductive adults, especially the older or oldest ones.” Given that illegal catch rates are likely underestimated (Cisneros-Mata 2020b), that measures of population status derived independently from catch estimates indicate a worsening trend since 2017, that poaching has resisted all attempts to deter it, and that interest to trade swim bladder is not abating and may be increasing, it is plausible that poaching pressure will continue and may increase beyond the status quo. It is also important to note that while there are recent estimates of effective population size (estimated number of breeding adults) (e.g. 1,900–2,760: Valenzuela-Quinonez <em>et al.</em> 2014; 4,250–11,120: UABC 2015), these cannot be used as an estimate of the number of mature individuals for Red List assessments (IUCN&#160;Standards and Petitions Committee&#160;2019).<br/><br/>A secondary threat to the population could be bycatch of juveniles in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery (although other smaller sciaenid species taken as bycatch in this fishery do not appear to have been impacted). In the 1980s, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (1995) estimated 120,834 individuals were taken as bycatch annually and some interpreted this relatively high number as an indicator of population abundance (Valenzuela-Quiñonez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although a scientific observer programme on board this fleet began in 2004, bycatch estimates for Totoaba juveniles are not yet available (Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. 2020b). Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020c) reported that Totoaba juveniles with lengths of 30–40 cm are most vulnerable. Cisneros-Mata (2020b) recommended that authorities fully implement the use of fish excluders in the industrial shrimp trawling fishery as García-Caudillo <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that Totoaba bycatch could be reduced by 80% with the full use of such devices.<br/><br/>While it is indisputable that habitat quality in the Colorado River Delta has been degraded by upstream dams which converted the formerly brackish-water habitat in the Upper Gulf of California into a hypersaline environment or negative estuary, the impacts on Totoaba are unclear and difficult to disentangle from impacts of fishing (Brusca <em>et al</em>. 2017). In addition, pre-dam flows were often low or non-existent given the arid landscape upstream in the southwestern U.S. (Brusca&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Modelling by Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020b) suggests that population levels were highest before damming in the late 1930s, but this is also the period where fishing pressure was the lowest. The lack of natural variability after the river was dammed may have also caused a reduction of variability in the species itself (Botsford <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ruiz-Berreiro <em>et al</em>. 2019), and there is some evidence that the life history of the species has been altered compared to prehistoric times (Totoaba may have matured more quickly in low saline environments: Rowell&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). However, Valdéz-Muñoz <em>et al.</em> (2010) sampled Totoaba juveniles in Upper Gulf and Delta waters with salinities between 35.3 and 39.5% and reported that captures of juveniles and salinity had no significant correlation. In 2011, Totoaba larvae were found only in the saltiest part of the Upper Gulf, close to the former mouth of the Colorado River&#160;<a name=""_Hlk59272725"">(Garcés-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2018). </a>However, extreme salinity levels were shown to be detrimental to the survival of Totoaba larvae in laboratory conditions (Giffard-Mena <em>et al</em>. 2020).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Gulf of California in Mexico where it occurs throughout the northern part and south to La Paz, Baja California Sur in the west and Mármol, Sinaloa in the east. Historically, this species’ southern limit was Bahía Concepción in the west and to the mouth of the El Fuerte River, Sinaloa in the east. Recent studies found juveniles in more southern latitudes (De Anda-Montañez <em>et al</em>. 2013, Valenzuela-Quiñonez <em>et al.</em> 2015), which may indicate new spawning grounds and/or positive effects from stock enhancement efforts. The capture of individuals in the Bay of La Paz and off Mármol suggest a possible southward range expansion by about 400 km (Guevara-Aguirre and Cisneros-Mata 2020), although these may represent extralimital records rather than full occupation, or the presence of captive releases. The depth range is 1–70 m (Hernández-Tlapale <em>et al.</em> 2020).","The species formerly supported an important commercial fishing industry and sport fishery in the Upper Gulf of California. Historically, the majority of the commercial catch was exported from Mexico to the United States as “sea bass.” It is also taken illegally by recreational sport fishers. Currently, although it is eaten locally for subsistence, its greatest value is for its swim bladder (“maw”) for the Chinese market, where the organ is cooked in a soup and valued as an investment product (Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em> 2019). China has a massive legal maw trade, but Totoaba trade is illegal under Mexican and Chinese national laws as well as international law (CITES Appendix I). See the attached Supplementary Information for details on seizures of swim bladders and specimens from 2013 to 2020 and net removals from 2016 to 2020.<br/><br/>Totoaba maw fetches a premium price in China due to its large size as well as unique resemblance to that of a China endemic, the Critically Endangered Chinese Bahaba (<em>Bahaba taipingensis</em>) (EIA 2016, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em> 2019). Recently, prices for Totoaba swim bladder have been falling. From 2015–2017, the retail price of a dried Totoaba swim bladder sold illegally in China declined from about $60,000 USD to $25,000 per kg (C4ADS 2017, page 63). In 2014, local prices in the Upper Gulf of California were around US$8,000 per kg (fresh weight) (CIRVA 2014). In 2017, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020a) reported that the price had fallen by half to about US$4,000 for a large, fresh 1 kg swim bladder (whereas small ¼ kg ones fetched just a few hundred dollars). However, after the coronavirus outbreak in February 2020, a Mexican journalist specializing in coverage of the region’s fisheries issues reported being informed by fishermen that “a swim bladder of one kg of weight that was previously bought for US$4,000 is now bought at US$2,200” (Mendez 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It has been theorized that a falling price paid to poachers could lead to reduction in poaching effort (Castellanos-Rico <em>et al</em>. 2019), but it is also possible that poaching efforts have increased to try to sustain previous income levels. Based on interviews, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al</em>. (2020a) learned that each fishing skiff poaching Totoaba captures between 6–20 individuals per trip, with exceptional catches up to 120 reported, and based on this, it was estimated that nearly 30,000 adult Totoaba were poached for their swim bladders in 2017. However, this could be an underestimate as subsequent information indicated that more fishing boats were active than originally calculated (the calculation was based on a range of 5 to 50 active boats per month during the spawning season), and Cisneros-Mata (2020b) later wrote “In recent confidential communications (2019). we were informed that the number of vessels engaged in the capture of adult Totoaba easily exceeded 100.” Poaching has since continued in a flagrant manner; on December 8th, 2019 it was estimated that at least 500 Totoaba individuals were captured in a single day’s mass poaching incident involving over 80 fishing skiffs (SSCS 2019b).",Marine,"Commercial Totoaba fishing bans have been implemented by the Mexican government on three occasions. Seasonal bans were implemented in 1940 and 1955 and a permanent ban was declared in 1975 (Government of Mexico 1975). In 1976, it was placed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). After an evaluation of its biological status, the Totoaba was added to the U.S. Endangered Species list in May 1979, and consequently, import to the U.S. became illegal. It was later also placed on the Mexican Endangered Species List (SEMARNAT 2010), although Guevara-Aguirre and Cisneros-Mata’s (2020a,b) revisitation of the Mexican listing criteria suggest it should be down-listed to Threatened. <br/><br/>The spawning ground in the Upper Gulf was designated a biosphere reserve in 1993 (DOF 1993). In 2017 and 2020, much of the Upper Gulf was designated as a Gillnet Exclusion Zone (SADER 2017, SEMAR 2020). Although the commercial fishery has been greatly reduced to historic low levels, illegal fishing and poaching continued in the Upper Gulf after these conservation measures were enacted. These illegal activities are now facilitated by organized crime groups in the region and this has sharply increased in the past decade compared to previous years (C4ADS 2017, EAL 2018, Chase 2019, Cisneros-Mata <em>et al.</em> 2020a). There is an urgent need to stop illegal fishing and trafficking of swim bladders. In November 2020, the government of Mexico, for the first time, arrested and charged a group of Mexican nationals under the Organized Crime Law for trafficking Totoaba (FGR 2020).<br/><br/>Although hundreds of adult Totoaba individuals are sampled from illegal nets each year, scientists have not been able to gather basic data about this species that would facilitate effective conservation and management. The status of this species would be better understood if data on age, reproductive status, weight, and genetic samples were collected.&#160;<br/><br/>Aquaculture facilities located in Ensenada in Baja California, La Paz in Baja California Sur and Kino Bay in Sonora are now in operation and facilitate enhancing the wild stock through release of cultivated juveniles. A genetic traceability study (parentage assignment) on juveniles from all supplemented areas within the Gulf is underway and should clarify the contribution of stocking to the wild population (C. True and L. Enriquez pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>Recommended conservation measures include eliminating poaching of pre-adults and adults and implementing an observer programme to evaluate juvenile bycatch (Cisneros-Mata 2020b). In December 2020, the Mexican government announced the final development stages of&#160;a comprehensive program for the Upper Gulf of California aimed at recovery of the Vaquita population and “eliminating illegal Totoaba capture” (SEMARNAT 2020).","",,false,false,Global
2870736,3851,Carcharhinus limbatus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2021,2020-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) is a medium-sized (to 286 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 140 m, though mostly it occurs close inshore. It also often occurs in large schools near the surface, and it has inshore nursery grounds. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., the United States Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Species-specific population trend data from these regions reveal population reductions of &lt;20% over the past three generation lengths in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa (27–45 years). The North Atlantic population reduction in the spawning stock fecundity was not to a level where the stock was overfished, while in Australia, stock assessments on the Blacktip Shark complex indicate stocks have recovered from previous overfishing and are now sustainable. In the Arabian Seas region, a population decline of 30–49% is suspected for the Blacktip Shark. Elsewhere, little data is available, but the species is exposed to intensive and unmanaged fishing effort and due to its preference for inshore habitats, has limited refuge from fishing pressure. There is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range where there is a lack of management, despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 54% reduction in the Blacktip Shark over the average past three generation lengths (38 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Overall, it is suspected that the Blacktip Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27–49 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Blacktip Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 140 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It mostly occurs close inshore including off river mouths, in estuaries, shallow muddy bays, mangroves, lagoons, and coral reef drop-offs (Ebert et al. 2013). It often occurs in large schools near the surface and has inshore nursery grounds (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kajiura and Tellman 2016, Amojil <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species reaches a maximum size of 286 cm total length (TL), males mature at 125–201 cm TL and females mature at 145–207 cm TL, with regional variation in these and age parameters; maximum size and size-at-maturity is smaller in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico than in the Indo-Pacific (Branstetter 1987, Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2006, White 2007, Tovar-Ávila <em>et al</em>. 2009, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Smart <em>et al</em>. 2015, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2016, Harry <em>et al</em>. 2019). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 1–11, a biennial-triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally), and size-at-birth of 38–72 cm (Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2004, White 2007, Harry <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Australia and Indonesia, female age-at-maturity is 8.3 and 7.6 years and maximum age is 24 and 17 years; thus, generation length is 16.2 and 12.3 years, respectively (Smart <em>et al</em>. 2015, Harry <em>et al</em>. 2019). In South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Winter and Cliff 1996). In the Gulf of Mexico and Northwest Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 6.5 and 6.7 years and maximum age is 23.5 and 17.5 years; thus, generation length is 15.0 and 12.1 years, respectively (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Passerotti and Baremore 2012, Baremore and Passerotti 2013, Deacy <em>et al</em>. 2018, SEDAR 2020).","The Blacktip Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is retained for its valuable meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is caught in recreational fishing and mostly released and is also caught in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, SEDAR 2020). Post-release mortality of sharks released alive was estimated at 44% and 31% for the United States commercial demersal longlines and gillnets respectively, and 19–23% for recreational line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Mohan <em>et al</em>. 2020, SEDAR 2020).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged commercial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years. For e.g, effective fishing effort of the small-scale fleet operating off Mauritania is estimated to have increased by a factor of 10 during the past 25 years (Gascuel 2007). The Blacktip Shark is occasionally caught in the Mediterranean Sea driftnet fishery (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019).","<p></p><p></p>Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between ocean basins (western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea distinct from eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific), potentially within ocean basins, and likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Keeney and Heist 2006, Sodré <em>et al</em>. 2012, Spaet <em>et al</em>. 2015, Almojil <em>et al</em>. 2018, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018, Bester-van der Marewe <em>et al</em>. 2019). Population trend data are available from three sources: stock assessments in (1) the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 2018) and (2) the Northwest Atlantic (SEDAR 2020); and standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in (3) the Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the stock assessment from the northern Gulf of Mexico estimated that in 2016 the stock was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring; the stock appeared capable of supporting the current fishing pressure (SEDAR 2018). The population declined from 1981 to the early 2000s, and then began to slightly increase, possibly in response to more limited catches in the latter years (SEDAR 2018). The spawning stock fecundity was estimated to have reduced from virgin levels in 1981 by 1–32%, but most likely by &lt;5% (SEDAR 2018). The trend analysis of the northern Gulf of Mexico abundance for 1981–2016 (36 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 6.6% over three generation lengths (45 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% population reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the stock assessment from the North Atlantic (from Maine to Florida) estimated that in 2018 the stock was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring, although it had experienced overfishing in some previous years (SEDAR 2020). Although the spawning stock fecundity declined by 54% over 38 years from 1981 to 2018, it did not fall below the minimum stock size threshold (MSST) which is used as a benchmark for stock status (SEDAR 2020). The trend analysis of the spawning stock fecundity for 1981–2018 (38 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 59.2% over three generation lengths (36 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% population reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the standardized CPUE from the Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) bather protection program (South Africa) fluctuated but steadily declined from 1981 to 2019 (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 20.3% over three generation lengths (27 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. In contrast, both recreational and commercial fishermen as well as SCUBA divers have noticed a marked increase in the abundance of Blacktip Sharks off the KwaZulu-Natal coast since ~2006 (M. Dicken, KZN Sharks Board, unpubl. data 2016). Indeed, the Blacktip Shark is considered a common species off the KwaZulu-Natal coast and is one of the most commonly caught species in both the KZNSB program (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) and competitive shore angling fishery (Pradervand 2004, Pradervand <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Additionally, standardized CPUE is available for combined Blacktip Shark and Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C. tilstoni</em>) from longline fishery independent surveys in northwest Australia (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020). The CPUE for 2003–2017 fluctuated, but overall was mostly stable, although there was a high level of uncertainty as the catches were relatively low. The area of the surveys was closed to commercial fishing from 1993 to 2005 onwards and the fluctuating, but overall stable pattern is suggested to reflect either no major detrimental fishing effects on the population even prior to the closures or naturally low abundance that precludes detecting abundance patterns (Braccini e<em>t al</em>. 2020). The lack of targeted fishing or incidental catch since ~2009 means there is no longer a threat in that region. Elsewhere in Australia, stock assessments for the Blacktip Shark species complex that consists of Blacktip Shark, Australian Blacktip Shark, and Spottail Shark (<em>C. sorrah</em>) suggest that while the northern Australian stock was over-exploited in the past, on the North and West Coast and on the East Coast the complex has recovered from previous fishing and is currently sustainable (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2013, Grubert <em>et al</em>. 2013. Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two of the species in the Blacktip Shark species complex are difficult to visually distinguish which has hampered species-specific stock status determination (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018)<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the Blacktip Shark is a common component of fishery catches (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015, Spaet and Berumen 2015). In some areas, it is the most common species landed, for e.g., in the Gulf of Aden and off the Socotra Islands, Yemen (Shaher 2007). Declines have been noted in some parts of the region, for e.g., in Oman, it was one of the most commonly caught species representing up to 7% of shark landings by number in 2002, but there was a noticeable decline in landings in 2003 to 1% of shark landings by number (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Pakistan, it was commonly taken in artisanal fisheries but has declined by 20–30% since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). In India, it was one of the most commonly caught shark species in the 1990s. However, in the last 10–15 years there has been a 60% decline in landings despite stable or increasing fishing effort (S.J. Kizhakudan pers. comm. to K.K. Akhilesh 09 February 2017) with reports that stocks of Blacktip Sharks (<em>Carcharhinus </em>spp.) have collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches with a population reduction of 30–49% suspected for the Blacktip Shark over the past three generation lengths (~39 years) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Blacktip Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark, Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This is equivalent to a 54% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Blacktip Shark (38 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Population declines of &lt;20% were estimated in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, and although there were 50–79% declines in North Atlantic, the spawning stock fecundity in 2018 did not indicate overfishing. Stock assessments in Australia suggest that while the stock was over-exploited in the past, it has recovered and is currently sustainable. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, high demand for the fins, and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population reductions. Across the Arabian Seas region, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (~39 years). The declines across the LMEs equate to a 54% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three average generation lengths of the Blacktip Shark (38 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. Overall, it is suspected that the Blacktip Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations lengths (27–49 years) due to levels of exploitation.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Blacktip Shark has a circumglobal distribution (Yano and Morrissey 1999, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hylton <em>et al</em>. 2017, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019).","The meat is valuable and sold at both local and international markets (Akhilesh 2011, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). There is a preference for its meat in the United States; similar species are also sold under the name ‘Blacktip’ (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The fins are valuable (fins with black tips obtain higher prices) and are traded internationally; Blacktip Shark fins accounted for 0.4% of fin samples analysed in Hong Kong (Fields <em>et al</em>. 2018). The liver oil is used for the cosmetics and nutraceutical sectors (Ebert et al. 2013, Cardeñosa 2019), and the skin is used to produce leather.",Marine,"Species- specific measures are in place in two countries, the United States (US) and Australia. In the US, the Blacktip Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Management Plan. Management measures include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers (SEDAR 2020). In Australia, the Blacktip Shark is managed as a complex with the morphologically similar species, the Australian Blacktip Shark and the Spotttail Shark. Management measures limit fishing effort and catch for commercial and recreational fishers, and 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2013, Grubert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In South Africa, this species is present in several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), including iSimangaliso, uThukela Banks, Aliwal Shoal, Protea Banks, Trafalar and Pondoland (Dicken and Hosking 2009, M. Dicken, Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB), pers. obs. 20 January 2016). Although this species is currently not heavily exploited, MPAs may become more important should targeted fishing develop in the future. With regard to the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets, the KZNSB has reduced fishing effort in order to reduce captures of all exploited species.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

Movement studies and DNA analyses have demonstrated that the White Shark undertakes long distance trans-oceanic movements, for example between South Africa and Australasia (Pardini <em>et al. </em>2001, Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005), and California and the Hawaiian Islands (Boustany <em>et al.</em> 2002, Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2008, Jorgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Consequently, its distribution is not considered disjunct, rather that interchange between some areas may be limited. <br/><br/>The maximum size is undetermined, but estimated at 600–640 cm total length (TL) (Compagno 2001). Males mature at 310–410 cm TL (Pratt 1996, Compagno 2001, Tanaka <em>et al.</em> 2011); the majority of females mature at 400–500 cm TL (Francis 1996, Tanaka <em>et al.</em> 2011) but have been reported as immature at 472–490 cm TL (Springer 1939, Compagno 2001); and, size at birth is  120–150 cm TL (Francis 1996). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with oophagy and histrophy, with litter sizes of 2–17 and  a suspected two to three year reproductive cycle (Francis 1996, Uchida <em>et al. </em>1996,<strong> </strong>Mollet and Cailliet 2002, Bruce 2008, Domeier 2012, Sato <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Western Indian Oceans, female age-at-maturity of 30–33 years and maximum age of&#160; 30–73 years were reported based on bomb radiocarbon validated ages (Hamady&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Andrews and Kerr 2015, Natanson and Skomal 2015,&#160;Christiansen<em> et al. </em>2016). Due to the accurate method of bomb radiocarbon ageing, these are possibly more accurate than the previous lower estimates of female age-at-maturity of 7–15 years and maximum ages of 18–30 years (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1985, Wintner and Cliff 1999, Bruce 2008, Tanaka<em> et al.</em> 2011, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using the precautionary approach and the validated, most conservative bomb radiocarbon ages of age-at-maturity of 33 years and maximum age of 73 years, generation length is 53 years.<strong></strong><strong> </strong>The bomb radiocarbon maximum age is accepted as being likely  &gt;30 years, minimum of 44 years, and possibly maximum of 73 years. The  female age-at-maturity is possibly more contentious and to explore the sensitivity of the global population trend analyses to the younger female age-at-maturity, estimates of female age-at-maturity of 15 years and maximum age of 44 years were also used, that led to a generation length of 29.5 years (see Population section).","<p>The White Shark is caught as bycatch mostly in inshore fisheries in a range of gears, such as longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, hand-held rod and reel, and fish-traps; it is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries (Bruce 2008, Lowe <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dewar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2013, Francis 2017, Onate-Gonzalez <em>et al. </em>2017). The species has a relatively high post-release survival in net fisheries (Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2013, Benson <em>et al. </em>2018). The White Shark is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Bruce 2008, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Braccini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018, Lee<em> et al. </em>2018, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). A shark control program in Réunion Island targets Tiger Sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>) and Bull Sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), with no captures of White Sharks reported to date (Florida Museum 2019).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the White Shark. Genetic data suggest one global population; however, there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins, potentially within ocean basins, and likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Pardini <em>et al</em>. 2001, Jorgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Gubili <em>et al</em>. 2012, O'Leary <em>et al</em>. 2015, Andreotti<em> et al. </em>2016, Bernand <em>et al</em>. 2018). White Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 5,460 in eastern Australasia in 2017 (uncertainty range: 2,909–12,802) (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al. </em>2018); in excess of 2,000 in the Northeast Pacific in 2012 (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014); and, in South Africa: 1,279 in KwaZulu-Natal in 1996 (Cliff <em>et al.</em> 1996), 908 in Gansbaai from 2007–2011 (95% CI: 808–1,008) (Towner <em>et al</em>. 2013), 723 in False Bay from 2004–2012 (95% CI: 466–980) (Hewitt 2014), 389 from 2008–2010 in Mossel Bay (95% CI: 351–428) (Ryklief 2012), and 438 for all of South Africa in 2011 (Andreotti <em>et al</em>. 2016), although there are concerns for the validity of this last estimate (Irion <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) standardized relative abundance in the Northwest Atlantic (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014); and standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) the Northeast Pacific (Dewar<em> et al.</em> 2013); (3) the South Pacific (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011); and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) updated with data to 2012 (S. Wintner pers. comm. 3/10/2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).</p><span lang=""EN-US"">    <p>First, the Curtis <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) relative abundance was used to represent data on catches in the Northwest Atlantic as it is the longest and most comprehensive compilation of data available for the region. It includes fishery-independent longline surveys, observer data from the shark-target bottom longline fishery, and recreational fishing tournament data. The relative abundance trend indicates historically higher abundances in the 1960s followed by a declining trend until the mid-1980s, and then an increasing trend since the 1990s, when a range of management measures were implemented (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014). The three generation trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic CPUE for 1961–2010 (50 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 80.8% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. This probability of a high level of reduction is over a very long period of three generations; it has incorporated the reductions from historically higher abundances and projected an estimated trend based on those reductions for a considerable period beyond that of the time-series and is thus indicative of historic declines rather than the recent increasing trend since 1990.<br/></p><p>Second, in the Northeast Pacific, White Sharks have mainly been taken in inshore net fisheries. Fisheries catch data were available from the California set net fishery which accounts for the majority of White Shark bycatch in that area; this indicated declines during the 1980s followed by a gradual increase from 1990s onwards (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on those data, information from photo-identification studies, and other researchers, the status review of White Shark in the Northeast Pacific concluded that the White Shark abundance was stable or increasing although there was some uncertainty around this conclusion due to the limited long-term abundance data for the region (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). The trend analysis of the Northeast Pacific California set net fishery CPUE for 1980–2010 (31 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 4.1%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 602.1% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths.<br/></p><p>Third, one of the longest datasets in the South Pacific is from the east coast of Australia shark meshing program in New South Wales (1950–2009) in which White Shark standardized CPUE markedly declined from 1950 to the 1990s after which it began to slowly increase (Reid <em>et al. 2</em>011). During this period there were modifications to net specifications and spatial and temporal effort, and since 2010, further changes have been implemented that include a reduction in net soak time (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, NSW DPI 2018). From 2008 to 2018, catches of White Sharks in the meshing program have fluctuated between 3 and 26 individuals annually, with increasing catches in the latter years (NSW DPI 2018). Further north along Australia's east coast, the standardized CPUE of White Sharks also declined significantly, by 92% over 54 years (1962–2015) in the Queensland Shark Control Program (Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). The trend analysis of the NSW shark meshing program CPUE for 1950–2009 (60 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with an estimated  median reduction of 95.8% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Since mid-1990s protection of White Sharks in Australia, adult White Sharks abundance has been estimated to have slightly declined or remained stable with population growth rates unlikely to be greater than 3% per year (Bruce<em> et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Based on the current <span lang=""EN-US"">eastern Australasian abundance estimate and species demographics (assuming continued protection) there should potentially be an increase in the eastern Australasian abundance as the current juvenile cohorts enter into maturity (R. Bradford pers. comm. 07/02/2019).<br/></span></p><p>Fourth, long-term standardized CPUE in shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa beaches in the Western Indian Ocean fluctuated considerably but was stable over time (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend analysis of the shark net CPUE for 1978–2012 (35 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.1%, consistent with an estimated  median increase of 13.1% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths. In the West Australian Indian Ocean, the White Shark modeled abundance is not predicted to have increased by more than 10% since 1997 when protection was enacted (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p><span lang=""EN-US""><p>Further to the above data and analyses, in the Mediterranean Sea, based on anecdotal records and limited fisheries data, the White Shark is suspected to have declined by at least 80% over 69 years from 1947–2016 (Soldo <em>et al.</em> 2016). With the exception of the Mediterranean Sea, in all other regions with data, the status review and studies indicate that the White Shark has declined  during the 1980s and has begun to show signs of increasing since  protection has been implemented. </p><p>Across the regions, the White Shark is estimated to be declining from historic levels in the Northwest Atlantic and South Pacific, and increasing in the Northeast Pacific and Indian Ocean. The trends among ocean regions are highly variable and while they are mostly based on long datasets, they are extrapolated over a very long three generation length of 159 years which increases the uncertainty in the estimated regional trends. With the exception of the Northwest Atlantic, they are also based on datasets from limited areas within each region and may not accurately represent the trend in White Shark across the entire region. Despite these caveats, the trend data are the best available and were used for the estimation of a global population trend; the estimated three generation population trend for each region was weighted according to the relative size of each region.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The overall  estimated median reduction was 53.8%,  with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three  generation  lengths (159 years).

Therefore, the White Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.</span></span></span></p><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><p></p></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The White Shark is wide-ranging throughout most temperate and tropical oceans but occurs most frequently in temperate waters (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).",<p>The White Shark fins and jaws have a high market value with large fins used as display items (Clarke 2004).

In 2004, the White Shark was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which requires Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. </p>  <p>In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the White Shark and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II.

For CMS Parties, this includes strict protections. In addition, initiatives to prevent lethal contact, minimize bycatch mortality, promote safe release, and improve reporting of catches (including discards) are needed. At a minimum, White Sharks should be subject to catch limits based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It occurs&#160;in temperate shallow, primarily nearshore waters from the surface to 570 m, and mostly &lt;136 m. The species is targeted and captured incidentally in deep-water industrial, artisanal, and recreational fisheries across its range. The species exhibits site fidelity to seasonal aggregations, making it susceptible to targeted fishing. Population genetics suggest there are three genetically distinct populations&#160;<a>with</a>&#160;little to no mixing across the oceanic basins which would increase the species’ vulnerability to fishing. There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, suspected declines in part of its range (south Atlantic, Northwest Pacific) but increasing trends in the Southwest Pacific, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.

In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;</p><p>The species exhibits site fidelity to seasonal aggregations, making the species susceptible to targeted fishing. For example, 97 individuals were reported from a single overnight gillnet fishing operation in Samborombón Bay, Argentina (De Wysiecki <em>et al</em>. 2018). Discrete populations with little evidence of migration increases the risk of localized population reduction. The Broadnose Sevengill Shark may also be susceptible to coastal development and environmental changes given its reliance on inshore habitat (Milessi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>","Population genetics indicate high genetic variability&#160;of the Broadnose&#160;Sevengill Shark&#160;among oceanic regions (Eastern Pacific, South Atlantic, and Southwest Pacific), suggesting three genetically distinct populations with little to no mixing&#160;populations which requires further investigation<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;(Schmidt-Roach 2019). The species is infrequently reported across much of its range. It has a high distribution overlap with intensive fishing activities throughout most of its known range, including past and/or present targeted shark fisheries across South America&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016, Irogyen and Trobbiani 2016), southern Africa (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015), Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b), and Australia (Graham<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2001,&#160;Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 60 years between 1950<a name=""_Hlk25584564"">–</a>2009 off New South Wales, Australia (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (65 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 3.4% consistent with an estimated increase over three generation lengths (65 years), with the highest probability of&#160;no reductions in population over the three generation lengths.&#160;<br/><br/>There is some ancedotal evidence of population reduction in the south Atlantic. In Argentina, opportunistic sighting records obtained from a recreational fishing magazine indicated declines in sighting records of the Broadnose Sevengill Shark between 1973<a name=""_Hlk25584564"">–</a>2008 (Barbini <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, the abundance of the species based on expert fishers knowledge dating back to the 1950s&#160;was estimated to have declined by up to 80% (Irogyen and Trobbiani 2016). Off southern Namibia, in 1990 a targeted fishery developed and closed within a year of operation due to the collapse of the stock (D. A. Ebert, pers. comm. 22/04/2020).&#160;&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/>In the Northwest Pacific, in Taiwan, landings data on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) showed a 52% decline for all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953–2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H.

Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates between 1950<a name=""_Hlk22720982"">–2014 for the</a><a name=""_Hlk20403173"">&#160;Japan and China EEZ</a>s, based on landings data, &#160;have shown declines of 98% (1,300 t to 14 t annually) and 67% (90,000 t to 30,000 t annually), respectively (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates from 1969–2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches were minimal&#160;during 1950, then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t, followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014&#160;(Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011).<p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (65 years) they represent declines of 99%, 67%, 99%, and 53% in Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Based on suspected declines in part of its range (south Atlantic, Northwest Pacific) and increasing trends in the Southwest Pacific, high levels of exploitation across most of the species' range, and a precautionary approach regarding the potential for separate subpopulations, a global population reduction of 30–49% was suspected over three generation lengths (65 years).

It is more frequently found close to land and in temperate waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of 573 cm total length (TL), and possibly 635 cm TL; size at birth is 120–150 cm TL, males mature at 260–420 cm TL, and females mature at 260–465 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Young <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous oophagous with litter sizes of 2–6 pups and an annual or biennial reproductive cycle (Gubanov 1978, Cailliet and Bedford 1983, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Gervelis and Natanson 2013). The potential annual rate of population increase under sustainable fishing is higher than that of the Pelagic Thresher&#160;and Bigeye Thresher&#160;and has been estimated at 0.254 (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008). Female age at maturity is estimated at 13 years and maximum age is 38 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages from the Northwest Atlantic (Natanson <em>et al.</em>  2016). In the Eastern Central Pacific, age-at-maturity estimates are  much younger, though not validated with female age-at-maturity at 5.3  years and maximum age at 22 years off California  (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is possible these are regional  differences in life history parameters, but adopting a precautionary  approach, the validated bomb radiocarbon ages are used for both regions  to give a generation length of 25.5 years.</p>","The Common Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic&#160;longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<p>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality that has been estimated for the Common Thresher as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""> At vessel mortality of 66.7% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;</span></span></p>","There are no data for population size of the Common Thresher. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between the Northwest Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans (Trejo 2005).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) relative abundance data in the North Atlantic (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016); and, (2) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Eastern North Pacific (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the relative abundance observer time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992–2013 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had stabilized, while noting that fishing pressure had been present for more than two decades prior to 1992 and that the abundance had stabilized at lower abundance than unexploited biomass (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992–2013 (22 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 97.0% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized, the 4.6% annual rate of reduction in the time-series produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the nominal logbook CPUE from California, United States west coast swordfish/shark drift gillnet fishery for 1981–2013 (33 years) was used as it considered the most important west coast commercial fishery for Common Thresher (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Common Thresher stock declined steeply in the early 1980s, then stabilized in the mid-1980s after regulations were implemented, and then increased through to ~2000 before stabilizing again, with the current stock considered close to unexploited level and unlikely to be overfished (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981–2013 (33 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.6%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 18.7% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, in the Southwest Atlantic CPUE of Common Thresher declined by 97% between 2002 and 2005 (Berrondo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The Common Thresher showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.11 (time range 108 years) and biomass of -0.10 (time range 108 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The Common Thresher is estimated to be declining in the North Atlantic and increasing in the Eastern North Pacific. However, the increasing trend in the Eastern North Pacific is from a managed fishery and may not be representative of trends in the wider Pacific. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median population reduction was 47.0%, with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths (76.5 years). However, as the trends are uncertain and there is a lack of data from other regions of the world, expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate a global population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

2908817,39368,Carcharhinus brevipinna,Vulnerable,A2bd,2020,2020-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Spinner Shark (<em>Carcharhinus brevipinna</em>) is a large (to 304 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Indo-West Pacific Oceans. It is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves at depths of 0–200 m. The low biological productivity combined with its schooling behaviour and tendency to occur in inshore waters make it susceptible to fishing pressure, although if the pressure is on the juveniles only, it can be sustainable.  The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and  recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl,  longline, and gillnets. Over the past three generation lengths (38 years), the population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic in response to management measures and to have undergone a minor reduction of 3% in South Africa. It is suspected to have declined by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (38 years) and is inferred to have also declined in the Mexican Atlantic, Southwest Indian Ocean, West Africa, and Southeast Asia. In Australia, it is captured in low numbers in managed fisheries and likely to be sustainably fished. The Spinner Shark has low biological productivity and although there is  less fishing pressure and managed fisheries in some parts of its range, most of its range occurs in areas of intensive and unregulated  fisheries. It is suspected  that the Spinner Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%  over the past three generation lengths (38–59 years) due to  exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Spinner Shark is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental and insular shelves at depths of 0–200 m (Weigmann 2016). It  is a highly migratory species that occurs more frequently in inshore rather than offshore waters and has nursery grounds in shallow, near-shore waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is often found in schools that may include large numbers of individuals. It reaches a maximum size of 304 cm total length (Weigmann 2016), males mature at 170–220 cm TL and females mature at 160–222 cm TL with regional variation in these parameters; smaller sizes-at-maturity are noted for the North Atlantic and Arabian Seas and the larger sizes-at-maturity for Australia, Taiwan, and South Africa  (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002, Joung <em>et al. </em>2005, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Geraghty <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 3–15, a biennial reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 48–80 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Jabado and Ebert 2015, Joung <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Australia, verified female age-at-maturity is 8.5 years and maximum  age is 31 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.8 years (Geraghty <em>et al. </em> 2013, Geraghty <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the Gulf of Mexico, verified female  age-at-maturity is 7.6 years with a maximum age of 17.5 years, resulting in a  generation length of 12.6 years (Carlson and Baremore 2005). These Gulf of Mexico ages are  similar to estimated ages in a previous Gulf of Mexico study and to ages  estimated from South Africa (Branstetter 1987, Allen and Wintner 2002).","The Spinner Shark is caught globally as target and retained bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl, longline, and gillnet (Joung <em>et al. </em>2005, McVean <em>et al.</em> 2006, Carlson and Bethea 2007, Geraghty <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jabado<em> et al. </em>2015, Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2017). It is also taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). Under-reporting of the Spinner Shark is likely due to misidentification with the Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Tillett <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).  At-vessel mortality (AVM) was estimated as 56% in a commercial prawn trawl fishery and 4–97% in commercial longline fisheries (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). The longer soak times in the longline fisheries had a much higher AVM (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/> <br/> In the Northwest Atlantic, the species is among a range of carcharhinids targeted by the commercial fishery along the southeast coast to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a common component of the commercial catch in the north-central  Gulf of Mexico, but is less often caught in the fisheries along the  eastern seaboard of the United States. It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility (Arrizabalaga <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with only 3 reported captures from 2010 to 2017 (ICCAT 2018).&#160;  <p>In the Mexican Atlantic, the Spinner Shark accounts for a small proportion of the total shark catch in the small-scale fishery catches. The small-scale fisheries in Mexico account for 97% of the country’s marine fleet and take most of the Mexican shark catch, which is substantial and places Mexico among the top 10 global shark catching countries (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Oakes and Sant 2019). Spinner Shark represented 0.1–1.4% of the shark catch over three separate studies from 1993 to 2014, with the number of individuals captured in those studies varying from 808 in 1993–1994, to 30 in 2007–2010, and 37 in 2011–2014 (Castillo-Géniz et al. 1998, Castillo-Géniz 2001, Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2020). The species was reported as seasonally common in the early years of the fishery during 1980–1998 (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al. </em>2020).  Fishing effort on sharks peaked in 1980–1998 but a 35% reduction in  shark catches from 1999 to 2008 led to a reduction in the shark fishing  fleet and effort (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas  <em>et al.</em> 2020). It has been recorded as a small portion of small-scale fisheries catches in the Guatemala Caribbean (Hacohen-Domené <em>et al. </em>2020).</p>  In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2005). In West Africa, the demand for shark fin in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, Set0 <em>et al.</em> 2017, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2019). Spinner Shark are among the reported shark catches of West Africa, with the species among those caught in the highest numbers in Guinea-Bissau (Diop and Dossa 2011). By 2010, there were an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels (that mostly take shark as bycatch) operating in West Africa (Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the Arabian Seas region, fisheries have experienced increased demand  for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result,  effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas and likely has increased fishing pressure on this species  (Bonfil 2003, Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;  <p>In South Africa, the Spinner Shark is caught incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, prawn trawl fisheries, and the beach protection program. The estimated average annual catch was 1–10 t from 2010 to 2012 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Mozambique and Madagascar, mostly unregulated small-scale fisheries that target sharks, including the Spinner Shark, are intense with 45,805 and 78,787 vessels, respectively operating in these countries in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p><p>  In Southeast Asia, the catches of this species vary spatially and temporally across the region. It was among the top 10 species landed at some major fishing ports, such as Cilicap, Indonesia and infrequently recorded elsewhere (SEAFDEC 2016). In Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught by longline, with juveniles a common catch of inshore gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, White <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). It was one of the most abundant species landed in eastern Indonesia from 2001 to 2006 (White 2007). The extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are also an indirect threat to coastal and inshore habitats of this species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/></p>In Australia, the Spinner shark is caught in low levels as bycatch in Western Australian trawl fisheries, the Northern Prawn Fishery, and the Eastern Tuna and Billfish longline fishery (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is also taken in east coast line fisheries, although it is frequently misidentified as either the Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C. tilstoni</em>) or the Common Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Tillet <em>et al. </em>2012). In southeast Queensland, approximately 30% of the total catch is the Spinner Shark, all specimens of which were less than one year old (Gutteridge 2012). While this catch is considerable, the life history of the Spinner Shark indicates that it can sustain high levels of fishing mortality in the juvenile age classes as part of a gauntlet fishery, that is, a fishery that only catches sub-adults and minimizes mortality on the breeding stock (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020). Therefore, this level of fishing effort in southeast Queensland is suspected to be sustainable. However, heavy fishing pressure on the adult stock is suspected to lead to population declines (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020).","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) relative abundance in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (Peterson <em>et al. </em>2017) and (2) catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in South Africa (M. Dicken pers. comm. 1/04/2019). The trend data from each source  were analyzed over three generation lengths (38 years) using a Bayesian  state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields  an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths,  and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent  change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). </p>    <p>First, the abundance index in the Northwest and Central West Atlantic derived from fishery-independent surveys with trawl, longline, and gillnet showed an increase in relative abundance from the late 1990s to 2014. This has been associated with the enactment of the shark Fishery Management Plan in 1993 and is indicative of recovery of the Spinner Shark in the region (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2017). It aligns with an earlier noted increase in relative abundance of 14% for the Spinner Shark in the commercial bottom longline fishery from 1994 to 2009 (Carlson <em>et al. </em>2012). The trend analysis of the Northwest and Central West  Atlantic relative biomass for 1996–2014 (19 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 8.5%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (38 years), with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths.<br/></p><p>  </p><p>Second, the South Africa nominal CPUE from the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program fluctuated but was considered stable from 1978 to 2019 (M. Dicken pers. comm. 01/04/2019). The trend analysis of  this CPUE for 1978–2019 (42 years) revealed annual  rates of reduction of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated median  reduction of 3.0% over three generation lengths (38 years), with the  highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>In the Mexican Atlantic, Spinner Shark were reported as being commonly seasonally caught in the earlier years of the fishery (1980–1998), followed by a decrease in catches likely as a result of intense fishing pressure (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020). Due to the intense effort in the early years of the fishery and low biological productivity, the Spinner Shark is considered highly vulnerable to the Mexican shark fisheries (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020).  </p><p>    </p><p></p>In the Arabian Seas region, the Spinner Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (38 years) due to its large size, valuable fins, susceptibility to fisheries, and intensive fisheries (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort in some areas as well as a reduction in the number of shark catches, which suggests population declines have occurred (Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example,&#160;in Eritrea&#160;catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 with a concurrent reduction in the CPUE of all sharks of ~66% (Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, and Yemen were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002). In Pakistan, catches of Spinner Shark have declined by 40–50% over the past 20 years due mainly to a large fleet that targets demersal fishes (M. Khan, pers. comm. 3 June 2020).<br/>  <p>In the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIO), including Mozambique and Madagascar, small-scale fisheries are intense with elasmobranch landings increasing nine-fold from 1970 to 2013 and the Spinner Shark reported among the catches, although there are no species-specific trends and no SWIO-wide concurrent effort data (Temple<em> et al.</em> 2018). Depletion of inshore shark stocks across the SWIO region may be occurring as small-scale shark fishers have shifted towards fishing further offshore (Temple <em>et al.</em>  2018). In Madagascar, reconstructed shark catches indicate dramatic  declines since the mid–1990s despite increases in estimated fishing  pressure with these large declines also evidenced by diminishing returns  for shark fishers (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Cripps <em>et al. </em>2015, Temple <em>et al. </em>2018).  In Mozambique, catches of small-scale fisheries, which account for 90%  of the total catches and include targeted shark catches, have  declined considerably in recent years, mainly due to overfishing and  illegal fishing (Benkenstein <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016), likely as a result of increased fishing pressure. The number of trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat (one of the major shark catching regions) has almost doubled between 2000 and 2010 from ~ 6,600–11,582 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004, CMFRI 2010).<br/><br/>In West Africa, all elasmobranchs are considered either fully exploited or overexploited due to intense and unregulated artisanal and industrial fishing pressure that includes targeted shark fishing, and the highest level globally of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Diop and Dossa 2011, Doumbouya<em> et al.</em> 2017, R.W. Jabado, pers. comm. 4 April 2020). The reconstructed industrial and artisanal fishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for all fishes across the region has declined by 30% since 1950, driven by a strong decline in artisanal CPUE (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Mauritania, overfishing of sharks is reported, likely driven by the strong interest in the shark fin fishery from the 1980s onwards (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Senegal, recent stock assessments reveal heavy over-exploitation of coastal demersal fish stocks (Ba <em>et al. </em>2018), and although there is no information on shark stocks, they are highly likely to be captured in these coastal fisheries and thus also likely subject to heavy exploitation levels. In Gambia, declines in shark fisheries have been reported from 2001 to 2011 with a recent study of an intensive shallow water demersal fishery reporting a dominance of batoids and the absence or rarity of previously common inshore elasmobranchs that raise concerns that some elasmobranchs have been severely depleted (Moore <em>et al. </em>2019).  <p> In Southeast Asia, catches of many shark species are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers. comm. 25/8/2007). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Spinner Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). <br/></p><p>In Australia,  the standardized CPUE for catches of all whaler sharks (26 species which includes Spinner Shark) in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has declined by 82% from 1962 to 2017 (Roff<em> et al. </em>2018). This represents a reduction of 84% when scaled to three generation lengths of Spinner Shark (59 years). The QSCP data is not species-specific, rather it is informative for understanding the potential levels of decline for the species in the region. Spinner Shark accounted for 2.3% of the total catch, with species identification reliable only from ~1996 onwards and it is unknown whether the decline in whaler shark catch rates represents an even decline across the 26 whaler species or a shift in species composition (Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, the effects of fishing on the Spinner Shark are limited, that is, in commercial fisheries in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia, as most of the fishing effort is focused on the juvenile age classes and the species is estimated to be sustainably fished.</p><p>     </p>  <p>The Spinner Shark population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, to have undergone a reduction of 3% in South Africa over the past three generation lengths (38 years), and to be sustainably fished in most of Australia. The increase in population is indicative of a recovery in response to management measures. In the Arabian Seas region, there are documented declines where it was previously targeted and is subject to intense and unregulated fishing pressure, and it is suspected to have undergone a &gt;30% reduction over the past three generation lengths (38 years). Elsewhere, declines are suspected based on depletions of inshore shark stocks, declines in general shark catches, and overfishing of sharks.<strong> </strong>The Spinner Shark has low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries, and  although there is lesser fishing pressure in some parts of its range  where there are managed fisheries, most of its range occurs in areas of  intensive and unregulated fisheries. Overall, it is suspected that this  species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past  three generation lengths (38–59 years).<strong></strong></p><p><strong>  </strong></p><strong>  </strong><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Spinner Shark occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and the Indo-West Pacific Oceans; it has not been recorded from the Northeast, Eastern Central, and Southeast Pacific Oceans&#160;(Ebert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>","The species is used for the meat, fins, liver oil, skin, and cartilage (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The meat is valuable and sold both fresh domestically and dried and exported. Spinner Shark fins accounted for 1.2% of fin samples in Hong Kong and 7.9% of the fins traded from United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Hong Kong; as UAE is a trading hub, the fins could have been sourced from across the Arabian Seas region and eastern Africa (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 8/4/2020).",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for Spinner Shark. To prevent future overfishing, it is recommended that Spinner Sharks be subject to regional and national catch limits based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, as well as improved reporting of catch and discard data, and efforts to minimize bycatch mortality.<br/></p>","",,false,false,Global
2910670,39372,Carcharhinus leucas,Vulnerable,A2bcd,2021,2020-11-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bull Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) is a large (to 400 cm total length) coastal shark with a circumglobal distribution. It is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore to a depth of 164 m, but mostly to ~30 m depth. The species is euryhaline and commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters. In some areas, it has often been confused with the Pigeye Shark (<em>C. amboinensis</em>) confounding information on distribution and abundance. The species is captured as target and bycatch by multiple fishing gears, including gillnet and longline, throughout its range and mostly retained for its meat and fins. Species-specific population trend data reveal the population is increasing in the Northwest Atlantic, likely in response to management measures, and decreasing in South Africa most likely due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, little data is available, but there is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range despite ongoing high levels of fishing effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 73% population reduction in the Bull Shark over the average past three generation lengths (68 years). This level of decline is not species-specific and while informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region, should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to declines in habitat quality and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Werry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly <em>et al</em>. 2014, Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly <em>et al</em>. 2014, Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo <em>et al</em>. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nevill <em>et al</em>. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tillett <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2005, Natanson <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, Guyomard <em>et al</em>. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).<br/><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A <em>et al</em>. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.<br/><br/>In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>C. sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.<br/><strong></strong><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Bull Shark has a circumglobal distribution (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nevill <em>et al</em>. 2014, SEAFDEC 2016, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018, Arai and Azri 2019, Deng 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2019, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, Soria <em>et al</em>. 2019, M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).<br/><p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","The Bull Shark is used for its meat which is consumed fresh locally and dried and exported and for its fins (Fields <em>et al</em>. 2018, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020). The skin and liver oil are also used commercially (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013), and in Pakistan, the late-term embryos are among the highest valued fish (M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). The Bull Shark is displayed in public aquaria.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.<br/><br/>In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It ranges from <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">northern Mexico to <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Ecuador in the eastern Pacific. The species inhabits shallow inshore tropical and subtropical waters around coral reefs and mangrove fringes on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 92 m. It is taken mainly in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries, which are intense and largely unmanaged throughout its range.<br/><br/>This species was formerly common in the Gulf of California in the 1960s but has since become rare there and extensive surveys of multiple landings sites in 1998–1999 did not encounter this species. Similar patterns of decline occurred in Brazil where it is considered extinct in the state of São Paulo and there have been no recent records in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species now appears to be rare, yet it was formerly abundant in Banc D’Arguin, Mauritania, and it has been depleted by the 1990s and not seen there since 2009. This species now only seems common in the Cape Verde and is rare elsewhere in West Africa. Artisanal and commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense and management is lacking throughout much of its range. It is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) in approximately three-quarters of its range in the Southwest and Eastern Central Atlantic and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, however, this species is likely to be stable in the Western Central and Northwest Atlantic part of its range which likely has significant fraction of suitable habitat and lower fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (50 years)&#160;based on abundance indices, regional decline in area of occupancy, and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.</span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>The Lemon Shark is demersal and pelagic in shallow inshore tropical and subtropical waters around coral reefs and mangrove fringes to a depth of 92 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of at least 340 cm total length (TL) and possibly as much as 368 cm TL (Hueter and Gruber 1982). Males mature at 224 cm TL and females mature at 239 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 4–17 pups, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 60–65 cm TL. Female age-at-maturity is 12.7 years and maximum age is at least 20.2 years (Brown and Gruber 1988), and possibly higher with one individual estimated to be 37 years old based on mark-recapture and genetics (Brooks&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Generation length is therefore at least 16.5 years. The Lemon Shark has low-to-moderate productivity of 0.158 year<sup>-1</sup> (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>","<p>The Lemon shark is taken as target and bycatch of artisanal and commercial longline and gillnet fisheries, which are intense and unmanaged across much of its range. It is taken recreationally on hook and line in the United States of America (USA). This shark has a medium-to-high susceptibility to fishing (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016, Saldaña-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and its large size and slow life history suggest it is sensitive to fishing pressure. Historically, the Lemon Shark has been a target species in Belize, Mexico, and USA and reported as bycatch in St. Lucia (Oliver 1996, Anon. 1997). In the USA in 2018, estimated commercial landings were 8,910 individuals yielding 37,593 lbs dressed weight and it was commonly caught by recreational anglers (NMFS 2019).</p><p>Fisheries effort increased considerably in the Gulf of California in the 1980s and 1990s, with an increase in the number of fishers, vessels, and nets in the water; depletion of large pelagic sharks and other species occurred and caused fishers to turn to coastal species (Sala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Off Mazatlan, Mexico, unmanaged gillnet and longline fisheries targeting sharks arose prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). Artisanal drift gillnets and demersal longlines are common further south in Mexico and there is a single record of this shark at ""Tres Marias"" Islands and Isabel Island in the Central Mexican Pacific (Pérez-Jiménez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Across much of its Central and South American range, artisanal fisheries are ongoing and are inadequately managed.</p><p>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) decreased by 71% from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased.</p><p>In Mauritania, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased by 246% over 1992–2015 (23 years). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,918 t in 1950 to 9,916 t in 1979 then declined to 6,302 t in 1991, then rose steeply to a peak of 17,015 t in 2015 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). These increases in landings are congruent with the fishing effort that has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). While effort has been stable, catches have continued to increase. In Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed at least a 30% decline, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Guinea-Bissau, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates data have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 22% decline over the years 2012–2016. Historically, catches gradually rose 6-fold from 782 t in 1962 to 5,001 t in 1997 then steeply rose to a peak of 17,181 t in 2012 followed by a fluctuating decline to 13,485 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region.</p><p>Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for Lemon Shark, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many parts of its range (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) and may have consequences for population viability.</p>","<p>The only estimate of abundance available for the Lemon Shark is from Bimini, The Bahamas where it is estimated that, on average, approximately 77 juvenile individuals inhabit the inshore areas of the North Sound at census time (White <em>et al. </em>2014) while there are around 400 juveniles in the South Bimini nursery (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). In the western Atlantic, Lemon Shark genetic structure has been proposed as both showing relatively little structure with no discontinuities between the Caribbean Sea and Brazil indicating that gene flow occurs throughout the western Atlantic (Schultz <em>et al.</em> 2014), and suggesting there are two distinct northern and southern hemisphere stocks (Ashe <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, population trend data is available from a stock assessment from the southeast United States (US), Gulf of Mexico, and the Bahamas (Hansell <em>et al.</em> 2020). The time-series of relative abundance (biomass as a fraction of that which would achieve maximum sustainable yield, B/BMSY) was analysed using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of the time-series for 1981–2017 revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 16.9% over three generation lengths (50 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.</p><p>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia this species is rare enough that the only recent records are anecdotal (P. Mejía-Falla unpubl. data 2020). In Brazil, this species has been exploited to the point where it has disappeared from&#160;parts of southeast and&#160;central Brazil after being formerly abundant. Similar levels of fishing pressure are likely to have occurred throughout southern central America and Venezuela and the Guianas. In Brazil, it is considered extinct in the state of São Paulo and it is serious depleted and there have been no recent records in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Espírito Santo (ICMBio 2018). Declines in juvenile abundance were documented in their nursery grounds at Atol das Rocas, a Marine Protected Area in Brazil, over a very short period (1999–2003) and hence it is hard to draw any wider population inference. These declines were used to suggest that even a modest level of fishing and removal of mature females in adjacent areas may dramatically affect small&#160;populations of sharks within a small and isolated protected area (Freitas <em>et al.</em> 2009). This species is considered to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;30% over three generation lengths (50 years) due to fishing pressure causing a decline in area of occupancy.<br/></p><p>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific this species was formerly common but because it was prized for its meat, fins, skin, and liver oil it has been intensively exploited to the point where it is now rarely landed and reported throughout its range. There are few data but insight into the pattern of decline can be derived from the long history of landings from Mexico. There, in the Gulf of California, the Lemon Shark was formerly common in the 1960s, but in recent decades has become rare in the artisanal fishery (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species was historically a prized catch (since the 1940s). Landings of this species peaked at 200 t in 1969 and declined to close to zero by the mid-1990s (<span lang=""EN-US"">Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). In comparison to other species, its relative abundance was scored as ‘high’ in the 1960s, ‘moderate' between the 1970s and 1980s and 'low' in the 1990s and 2000s (<span lang=""EN-US"">Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was not recorded in surveys of 28 artisanal landings sites in Sinaloa from 1998–1999 that enumerated a total of 2,390 sharks (Bizarro <em>et al. </em>2009, J.J. Bizarro unpubl. data. 2020). Elasmobranchs are the target fishery across much of this state (Bizarro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160;Other species that have undergone a similar pattern of decline in Gulf of California, Mexico are similarly rare throughout the region. For example, the Whitenose Shark (<em>Nasolamia velox</em>) underwent a similar pattern of decline in Mexico and is suspected to have declined to the point where it was assessed as Endangered throughout its distribution in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific (R. Pollom pers. comm. 25 August 2020). On the Pacific Ocean side of Costa Rica, this species may have been taken in small numbers in the demersal longline fishery 10–15 years ago but now that effort has been reduced as the fishery transitioned to an offshore pelagic longline fishery. Gill nets have also been reduced in the North Pacific in recent years (M. Espinoza unpubl. data 2020).</span></p><p>In Colombia, there are few historic records of this species, and it can be considered scarce there, found only at Gorgona Island on the Pacific coast (P. Mejía-Falla unpubl. data 2020). This species may now be very uncommon in Ecuador (<a>A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2020</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">). In the area around Caleta Constante in northern Peru, there is an artisanal fishery targeting elasmobranchs (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). While the main catch included Smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus </em>spp.), Angel Shark (<em>Squatina armata</em>), Pacific Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos</em> <em>planiceps</em>), and stingrays (<em>Myliobatis</em> spp. and <em>Urotrygon </em>spp.), other species caught included Lemon Shark, Bull shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), Tiger Shark (<em>G. cuvier</em>), and other <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp. Catches of elasmobranchs in the artisanal fishery in the years leading up to 1995 had declined significantly (Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005). Artisanal and some commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense over much of its range and lacks management. Overall, given the intense fishing pressure through most of its Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific range and its relative rarity in recent decades in some areas, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths in the region (50 years).</p><p>Fourth, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, this species now appears to be rare throughout its range, yet there is good narrative evidence that it was formerly abundant in Banc D’Arguin, Mauritania and declined by the 1990s. This species now only seems common in the Cape Verde Islands where there are sufficient numbers that there are tourism tours of nursery areas (S.D. Pires unpubl. data 2020). Understanding the status of this species is challenging as it is often distributed close to mangroves and may be less catchable by artisanal longlines and gillnets set in deeper waters or in research surveys (G. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).<span lang=""EN-US""> The best understanding of decline of sharks and rays comes from the history of the Banc d’ Arguin in Mauritania (M. Ducrocq pers. comm. 25 August 2020). There, sharks were historically abundant, and were not exploited prior to the 1970s and 1980s. Until then coastal artisanal fishers only used surface and demersal nets, and there were no motorized canoes. Development and subsidies drove people towards fisheries including fisheries for sharks using larger mesh gillnets. This combined with the incentive to retain fins from fin buyers led to the rapid depletion of sawfishes (<em>Pristis</em> spp.) and giant guitarfishes and wedgefishes (<em>Glaucostegus</em>, <em>Rhynchobatos</em> and <em>Rhynchorhina </em>spp.), with the last sawfish seen in early 1990s. By late 1990s, hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna&#160;</em>spp.), Oceanic Whitetip (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>), Silky Shark (<em>C. falciformis</em>), Dusky shark (<em>C. obscurus</em>) and other carcharhinids were targeted. In a period of 10-11 years these species became rare including Lemon Shark and Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>) (M. Ducrocq </span><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 25 August 2020). Lemon Shark has not been recorded in the Banc d’ Arguin National Park since 2009 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, this species is now very rare in Senegal with no captures near Dakar, and only one documented capture from Casamance region on the border between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau (A. Ba unpubl. data 2020). Lemon shark is rarely encountered in Guinea-Bissau, it was not captured in research surveys but may be captured by recreational fishers closer inshore near the mangroves (G. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). There were only three records of this species from surveys of artisanal gillnet fishers in Ghana (I. Seidu pers. comm. 26 August 2020). There are no recent records from Nigeria, but it is possible that Lemon Shark is present in commercial landings, but the catch composition information is aggregated and cannot be identified to species level. There were no recent records from a landing site survey in Cameroon (A. Tamo pers. comm. 26 August 2020), yet there are historic records of this species from a fish market in Cameroon in 1991 but it none since then (C. Grist pers. comm. in Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2005). Lemon shark is captured commonly by artisanal fishers and there are a few records of capture in industrial fisheries (K. Metcalfe and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). There are few records from research surveys of landing sites but it may be captured in commercial fisheries (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). There are more records from adjacent to mangrove forest of the Parc National Conkouati Douli, Republic of Congo (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). There are few records of this species from occasional landings site surveys in Angola (A-L. Soares pers comm. 24 August 2020).&#160;Given the intense fishing pressure through most of its range in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).</span></p><p>Artisanal and some commercial target and bycatch fishing pressure is intense over much of its range and lacks management. Overall, given the intense fishing pressure through most of its range, the species' apparent limited biological productivity, and its relative rarity in recent decades in some areas, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) in approximately three-quarters of its range in the Southwest and Eastern Central Atlantic and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, however, this species is likely to be stable in the Western Central and Northwest Atlantic part of its range where there is a significant fraction of habitat. Overall, it is suspected that the Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (50 years)&#160;based on abundance indices and actual levels of exploitation.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Lemon Shark is found in the Atlantic Ocean and the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Oceans. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from Virginia (United States of America) to southern Brazil including the Caribbean Sea and in the eastern Atlantic, it ranges from Mauritania to Angola, including Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe (S.D. Pires and G. Porriños unpubl. data 2020). In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, it occurs from northern Mexico to Ecuador (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).</p>","Lemon shark are utilized primarily for meat and fins and comprise 0.46% of the fin trade, based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015 (Cardeñosa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The rough and heavy skin has made the lemon shark one of the preferred species among tanneries for the production of leather. In parts of its range it is also valued for its liver oil. The Lemon Shark is routinely viewed by recreational snorkellers and SCUBA divers, and is a popular aquarium species.",Marine,"In July 2006, the United States (US) National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. New&#160;habitat areas of particular concern (HAPCs) are being developed for Lemon Shark to reflect recommendations in the 2015 five-year review of the Highly Migratory Species Essential Fish Habitat in the USA.&#160;Lemon sharks are prohibited from being harvested in state waters of Florida, where most of the US habitat occurs.<br/><br/>Misidentification of this species is widespread and likely to  hinder monitoring and conservation efforts (R. D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year. The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004. The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts there. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploitation may be occurring at present or in the future (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). Cuba has designated 21% of the country as a Marine Protected Area. There is no fishing for sharks or rays in these areas. The most important Marine Protected Area is Jardines de la Reina, Alejandro de Humbolt, Guanacabibes. Shark fishing is illegal in Jardines de la Reina Marine Reserve and local guides have noted an increase in sightings of many species of reef-associated sharks including this species since 1997 when the reserve was declared and enforcement of fishing regulations began. Cuba also has two places designated for diving with sharks, Santa Lucia and Jardines de la Reina. Cuba has a prohibition on finning and in 2015 adopted a National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks).&#160;<br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15–June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that prohibit finning. It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a Marine Protected Area of 30 km from the Rio Bravo´s mouth to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>In the wider Caribbean, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the System of Integration (SICA), prohibits shark finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries from Belize to Panama, including the Dominican Republic. In Belize, there are currently no conservation measures protecting sharks throughout territorial waters. Despite no-take restrictions in marine reserves, illegal fishing continues to take place and reef sharks are known to be caught. As such, increased enforcement is required in Belize's 13 marine reserves to specifically protect shark species against illegal fishing. Most sharks caught as bycatch in the hook and line fisheries could be released live but are usually landed. In Guatemala, there is a fishing ban for one month (usually August) for the capture of sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Decree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Decree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>Currently, there are some Marine Protected Areas in the middle and west of the Caribbean coast of Panama (e.g. Portobelo National Park, Bastimentos Island National Marine Park). These protected areas provide a certain level of ecosystem management through implementing control over local fisheries and providing protection for critical habitats (e.g. coral reefs, mangrove), both of these measures can benefit shark populations. Despite the creation of these marine parks, enforcement of protective initiatives in these areas is a challenge. In addition to the creation of Marine Protected Areas, Panama has established nationwide conservation and management policies for the fisheries industry. In 2006, an official regulation was approved that prohibits shark finning in Panama waters. In 2017, new regulations were implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of the number of hooks to 1,000 per surface longline strand), which will help to further contribute to the conservation and management of sharks in Panama.<br/><br/>The archipelago of San Andrés y Providencia, Colombia, was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000, and covers an area of 180,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(i.e., 10% of the total area of the Caribbean Sea) and comprises some of the most productive and biodiverse reefs in the region. Since 2008, all shark species have been fully protected in the Seaﬂower Biosphere Reserve, banning ﬁshing and possession of all sharks and their byproducts. These has led to one of the highest shark abundances found in the Caribbean Sea. Local communities pushed for these shark conservation measures in the Archipelago, simplifying the enforcement by local authorities. Enforcement in remote regions against poaching has been challenging, although the Colombian Navy has been leading the enforcement of these areas and has enabled scientific data collection. In addition, Colombia has banned wire-leaders on their longlining ﬁsheries as a bycatch-reduction measure across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where industrial ﬁsheries are only allowed to have a total shark by catch of 35% in a single ﬁshing trip. Finning is prohibited within the Colombia EEZ and ﬁns are required to be attached naturally to the body at landing.<br/><br/>Antilles, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. In Brazil, this species is part of the National Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks and Marine Skates Threatened by Extinction and is protected in some conservation units: Rio Grande do Norte (REBIO of the Atol das Rocas) Pernambuco (Fernando de Noronha Marine Park, APA Fernando de Noronha - Rocas - São Paulo Pedro and São Paulo; and in Bahia (PARNA Marinho dos Abrolhos) (ICMBio 2018).<br/>  <p>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

Population growth rates of 0.225 per year are among the fastest known for pelagic sharks and the fastest of the hammerhead species. The Smooth Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins, and sometimes the meat. It has undergone steep historic declines in the Atlantic but the introduction of management measures may be allowing slow recovery, lesser declines in the South Pacific, and increases in the Indian Ocean. The weighted global population trends estimated a median reduction of 21.8–64.8%, with the highest probability of &lt;20% and &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years). The Northwest Atlantic data that includes the period after management changes led to the lower estimated global reduction. However, there is uncertainty  in  some of the catch data, limited regional representation of some time-series, and intensive-fisheries in data-poor regions&#160;that are suspected to have driven declines, balanced with the  relatively lower level of artisanal fisheries threat to this species compared to that of the Scalloped Hammerhead (<em>S. lewini</em>) and Great Hammerhead (<em>S. mokarran</em>), due to its generally more temperate distribution. Expert judgement elicitation thus inferred a global population reduction of 30–49% and the Smooth Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd. More robust species-specific data and monitoring of catches is  required  to improve certainty of catch estimates for a future assessment  of  this species.</p>","<p>The Smooth Hammerhead is a coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark that occurs on the continental shelf to at least 200 m depth, and possibly 500 m (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It is the most oceanic of the hammerhead species, commonly leaving coastal habitats at 2–3 years of age (Clarke<em> et al.</em> 2015). Despite its widespread occurrence, biological data on this species is limited. It attains a maximum size of 370–400 cm total length (TL) (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at  250–260 cm TL and females at about 246–265 cm TL (Stevens 1984, Castro and Mejuto 1995). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 20–50, a gestation period of 10–11 months, unknown reproductive periodicity, and a size-at-birth of 49–63 cm TL (Stevens 1975, Stevens 1984, Smale 1991, Castro and Mejuto 1995, Doño 2008, Francis 2010, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Clarke <em>et al. </em>2015, Rosa<em> et al. </em>2017, Gallagher and Klimley 2018). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 15 years based on size-at-maturity and the growth curves from Rosa <em>et al. </em>(2017).  The maximum ages observed are 24 years for females and 25 years for  males (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2017). However, these are unlikely to be the true maximum ages as   individuals from the study were a maximum size of 286 cm TL,  considerably less than the known maximum size (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2017). Generation length is estimated at 24.1 years based on  that of Scalloped Hammerhead which reaches a similar size and has a maximum age of 35 years (Drew <em>et al.</em>  2015). Population growth rate estimate is among the fastest of the  known pelagic sharks and the fastest of the hammerhead species at 0.225  per year (Cortés <em>et al. </em>2012).</p><p>  </p>  <p></p>","<p>  </p><p>The Smooth Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves, and in some areas, such as Peru, this includes capture of pregnant females and juveniles (White<em> et al.</em> 2006, Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is often retained for the fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>High at-vessel mortality of 71% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012).  The post-release mortality is higher for injured released sharks; it  has been reported as 100% for the closely-related Scalloped Hammerhead  in purse seines (Eddy <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Smooth Hammerhead is  taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks with high  mortality in the beach mesh nets in New South Wales of ~95% prior to  2010; nearly all of the Smooth Hammerhead catch is juveniles (Dudley and  Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>There are no data available on the global population size of the Smooth Hammerhead. Genetic studies reveal structure between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific, however contrasting results may indicate female philopatry and male mediated gene flow (Testerman 2014).<br/></p><p>  </p><p>Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Jiao <em>et al</em>. 2011), and from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (J. Carlson unpubl. data); (3) the South Pacific (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011) and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dicken <em>et al. </em>2018).  The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation  lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker<em> et al</em>.  2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change  over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely  IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the  Supplementary Information).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p><p>First, the Northwest Atlantic stock assessment for 1981–2005 indicated that the stock was overfished from the mid-1980s with overfishing occurring continuously from 1994–1998, and the risk of overfishing generally low after 2001 when catches dramatically reduced (Jiao<em> et al</em>. 2011). A previous stock assessment found significant historical declines and that abundance had stabilized since the late 1990s (Hayes 2008); however, both stock assessments report a high degree of uncertainty mostly due to poor catch data that includes very low sample sizes, unreliable data due to the scarcity of Smooth Hammerhead in fisheries catches, and issues with accurate species identification (Miller 2016). The trend analysis of the Northwest  Atlantic modeled abundance for  1981–2005 (25 years) revealed an annual  rate of reduction of 7.0%,  consistent with an estimated median reduction of  99.6% over three  generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest  probability of &gt;80%  reduction over three generation lengths.&#160;</p><p>  </p><p>Second, more recent data (1992–2017) are available from  Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico comprising the pelagic longline observer time-series  underlying the Jiao <em>et al</em>. (2011) stock assessment for Smooth Hammerhead (J. Carlson  unpubl. data). The time-series indicate this population has slowly begun to  increase after the implementation of management after 2005 (NMFS  2006). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1992–2017 (26 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 0.8% with a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (72.3 years).&#160;</p>  <p></p><p>Third, hammerhead catches in the New South Wales (Australia) beach meshing program, which comprised predominantly Smooth Hammerhead, fluctuated over 60 years with strong declines from 1990–2010 (Reid <em>et al. </em>2011). The trend analysis of the CPUE for   1950–2009 (60 years) revealed an annual rate of reduction of 3.0%,   consistent with an estimated median reduction of 17.9% over three   generation lengths (72.3 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20%   reduction over three generation lengths.&#160;</p><p>Fourth, the Smooth Hammerhead CPUE in the South Indian Ocean Natal Shark’s Board bather protection netting program varied markedly over 1978–2014 with a slight, but not significant, increasing trend (Dicken <em>et al. </em>2018). The analysis of the CPUE for   1978–2014 (37 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 0.6%  with a median increase and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (72.3 years).&#160;</p>  <p> Further to the above data and trend analysis, standardized CPUE data from the Portuguese longline fishery in the    Eastern Central and Southwest Atlantic for 2008–2016 indicated    fluctuations for 2008–2010, a decrease till 2013 then an increase back   to 2008 catch levels in 2016 (Santos and Coelho 2019). We considered a recent   analysis of fishery-dependent longline CPUE from the South Atlantic.   These time-series are complex, reflecting access by different fleets and   nationalities over time, but the best estimates of trends come from   phase B spanning 1998 to 2008 during which twenty fleets (100 vessels)   fished for tunas, swordfishes, and sharks. During this 10-year period   there was a 61.7% decline in CPUE of hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna</em> spp.) (Table S11, Barreto <em>et al.</em>   2016), however, because the data were not considered robust due to the   low catch rates and large confidence intervals (R. Barreto unpubl. data), they were not analyzed over three generations.&#160;</p><p>In the Southeast Pacific, landings of Smooth Hammerheads in Peruvian small-scale gillnet fisheries (1996–2010) peaked in 1998 and 2003 at ~1,500 tonne annually, but for the remainder of the period were fairly stable at 200–300 tonne annually (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al. </em>2016). Without any effort data, it is not possible to ascertain if this is a reflection of stock abundance trends (Miller 2016).<strong> </strong>Population trend data from the North Pacific and Western Central Pacific is  limited. In the North Pacific, landings of Smooth Hammerhead from Taiwan  comprise a small proportion (1.38%; ~78 tonne) of the annual catch and  although catches have declined in recent years, so too has the fishing  effort and it is not possible to determine a population trend (Miller  2016). In the Western Central Pacific, hammerhead catches are for the  species-complex, with no indication of the proportion of Smooth  Hammerheads. The CPUE (1995–2015) was highly variable and as Smooth  Hammerhead are  captured infrequently, little inference was possible from the temporal  trend (Rice <em>et al.</em> 2015). An analysis of Smooth Hammerhead yield- and biomass-per-recruit on the  Kerala coast, India in the Northern Indian Ocean for 2008–2009, indicated  that the stock was over-exploited (Manjusha <em>et al. </em>2011). Fishing pressure has significantly increased in recent decades across the distribution of the Smooth Hammerhead in the tropical Western Indian Ocean (Cooke 1997, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017), and has likely caused declines in this region.</p><p>Steep declines of hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.) have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti<em> et al.</em> (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwest Mediterranean Sea. Of the taxa for which there were enough data to investigate, hammerhead sharks declined the fastest; disappearing from coastal waters after 1963 followed by declines (across all fishing sectors) in pelagic waters by the early 1980s. Meta-analysis showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.17 (time range 178 years) and biomass of -0.36 (time range 107 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.99% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2008). Walker <em>et al.</em> (2005) also report that hammerhead species have virtually disappeared from the central-southern Mediterranean Sea since 1986.&#160; <br/></p>    <p>The Smooth Hammerhead trend analyses estimated historic declines in the Atlantic and South Pacific, and an increase in the Southern Indian Ocean. There are some signs of stabilization and possible recovery in response to management in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, fluctuating but overall stable catches in the Eastern Central and Southwest Atlantic in 2016, over-exploited stocks in the Northern Indian Ocean, and likely declines in the tropical Western Indian Ocean due to intense fishing pressure. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation  population trends for each region (Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian) were weighted according to the relative size of each  region; the two sources of North Atlantic were used to generate two global trends. This resulted in a median reduction of 21.8–64.8%, with the highest  probabilities of &lt;20% and &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3  years). The second Northwest Atlantic data that includes the period after management changes led to a far lesser estimated global reduction, yet it needs to be considered that all time-series are from limited areas within  each region and may not accurately represent the trend in Smooth  Hammerhead across the entire region. There is uncertainty in some of  the catch data and levels of exploitation; the regions with no trend  data are likely areas where the species is under the most pressure, such  as the tropical Western Indian Ocean. Yet, the Smooth Hammerhead is a generally more temperate species  than the Scalloped Hammerhead and Great Hammerhead<em></em> and thus, the  majority of its distribution is not as exposed to the same level of threat  from intense artisanal fisheries. Based  on the considerations of possible recovery  in areas with managed fisheries, potential declines in intensively  fished data-poor regions, and less relative exposure to artisanal fisheries than the other two large hammerhead species, expert judgement elicitation inferred a global population reduction of  30–49% over three generation lengths (72.3 years). More robust species-specific data and monitoring of catches is required  to improve certainty of catch estimates for a future assessment of this  species.</p><p><br/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Smooth Hammerhead occurs worldwide in temperate seas and in some regions, it is present in tropical seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Bezerra <em>et al. </em>2018).","<p>The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are among the main shark species in the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke<em> et al.</em> 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018). Smooth Hammerhead accounted for 1.7% of the fin imported and was the fourth most abundant traded fin species in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields<em> et al.</em> 2018).

The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Great Hammerhead as a 'key shark species' in 2010, but has yet to adopt hammerhead catch limits. Several proposals to ban hammerhead landings and/or set regional hammerhead fishing limits through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have been defeated. </p>  <p>In 2013, the Smooth Hammerhead was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) based on its similarity to the Scalloped Hammerhead.

In 2018, the Smooth Hammerhead was added to Annex 1 of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for Migratory Sharks, even though the species has not (yet) been included on the CMS Appendices. The MoU is aimed at facilitating regional conservation of listed shark and ray species. Great and Scalloped Hammerhead Sharks were listed on CMS Appendix II in 2014.

It also occurs in brackish or freshwater in the lower reaches of rivers and in bays and has inshore nursery grounds. The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries with mainly longline and gillnet gear. It has a low biological productivity that would lower its resilience to fishing pressure. The Copper Shark appears to represent only a  small part of the reported shark catches in most regions and may have a  naturally low abundance across most of its range. Population trend data was available from South Africa for 26 years (1978–2003) and from South Australia for 17 years (2002–2018). In South Africa,  the population was estimated to have increased over the past three generation  lengths to 2003 (71 years) in the bather protection program, yet from 2003 to 2018, the CPUE steadily declined. In South Australia, the population was estimated to have undergone a reduction of  62.6% over three generation lengths (71 years). Elsewhere in Australia the population was considered stable, except for a potential decline in the New South Wales shark meshing program. The Copper Shark  population has potentially increased in the Gulf of California, is potentially increasing or stable in New Zealand, and has potentially  declined in the Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and  Peru. Except for the Northwest Pacific, where there has likely been an  actual inferred decline in population abundance of 55–99% over the past three generation lengths (71 years), there is little concurrent  effort data for this species in those regions and thus the population  trend cannot be definitively determined; the changes may be due to  environmental factors and changes in fishing practices. There is a high level of uncertainty with the estimated population trends, and over most of its range the Copper Shark appears to be declining. <a name=""_Hlk37079390"">With a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Copper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past  three generation lengths (71 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.<br/></a></p>","<p>The Copper Shark occurs in warm temperate and subtropical waters on the continental shelf from close inshore to depths of 145 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Weigmann 2016). It also occurs in brackish or freshwater in the lower reaches of large rivers and estuarine bays, appears singly and in loose schools of hundreds of individuals, and has inshore nursery grounds (Cliff and Dudley 1992, Last 2002, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Drew <em>et al.</em> 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 325 cm total length (TL), males mature at 200–255 cm TL and females mature at 215–270 cm TL, with regional variation in these parameters; size-at-maturity is smaller in Argentina than in South Africa and Australia (Cliff and Dudley 1992, Lucifora <em>et al.</em> 2005, Last and Stevens 2009, Drew <em>et al.</em> 2017). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 7–26, a likely biennial reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 59–70 cm (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Drew <em>et al.</em> 2017). Female age-at-maturity is 16 years and maximum age is 31 years, resulting in a generation length of 23.5 years (Drew <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>The Copper Shark is caught globally as target and retained bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, mainly demersal longline and gillnet and to a lesser extent, pelagic longline and demersal trawl. The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Gibbs <em>et al. </em>2020). Under-reporting of the Copper Shark is likely due to misidentification with the Dusky Shark (<em>C. obscurus</em>) and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna</em>) (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, Junge <em>et al.</em> 2019). At vessel mortality ranges from 0–36% for commercial gillnets and 0–67% for commercial longline fisheries (Ellis<em> et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In the Atlantic, the Copper Shark is rarely captured within the ICCAT Convention area; captures were only reported for seven years from 1950 to 2017 and in most of those seven years, fewer than three individuals were reported (ICCAT 2018). In the Mediterranean Sea, the species is rarely reported in landings, with only 20 individuals reported from Algerian waters from 1996 to 2002 (Hemida <em>et al. </em>2002), and six individuals captured in tuna traps off Sardinia from 1990 to 2009 (Storai <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p>In the southwest Atlantic, the Copper Shark is targeted in commercial species taken in coastal Argentinean gillnet elasmobranch fisheries, and although 292 individuals were captured by two vessels within one month in 1993, overall it is considered relatively scarce in the area (Chiaramonte 1996, Chiaramonte 1998, Cedrola <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also taken in longline and occasionally by trawl fisheries off southern Brazil and Uruguay, though it is considered rare in Brazil waters and is only sporadically captured in Uruguay (Amorim <em>et al. </em>1998, Marín <em>et al. </em>1998, Díaz <em>et al. </em>2004, Lucifora 2005, Rotundo <em>et al.</em> 2019). It occurs in the Brazilian elasmobranch meat trade but is uncommon (Almerón-Souza <em>et al. </em>2018). Díaz (<em>et al.</em> 2004) reported catches of up to 290 individuals of <em>C. brachyurus</em> per 1,000 hooks from a longline fishery off Uruguay.<br/></p>  <p>In South Africa, the Copper Shark is taken in the demersal shark longline fishery and it is taken incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, beach seine and gillnet, demersal and mid-water trawl fisheries, and the bather protection program. The estimated average annual catch was 101–200 t from 2010 to 2012 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bitalo <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>In the Northwest Pacific, the Copper Shark is rarely reported (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the East China and South China Sea. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels and small mesh sizes has caused declines in all fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and since then have remained relatively stable (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015, FAO 2019). <a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat to the Copper Shark’s inshore habitats. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). </a></p>  <p>In Australia, the Copper Shark is taken by demersal gillnet and longline fisheries and annual catches are stable (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Walker and Gason 2007, Braccini and Blay 2018). In Western Australia, the species is mostly caught within the temperate demersal gillnet and demersal longline&#160;fisheries, which mainly targets juvenile Sandbar Sharks (<em>C. plumbeus</em>) and Dusky Sharks (<em>C. obscurus</em>)&#160;and are now sustainable fisheries due to management measures that have led to measurable recoveries (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Braccini and Blay 2018). The Copper Shark accounts for ~3% of the landings in that fishery and catches of the species across all Western Australian commercial fisheries have fluctuated from 48 to 60 t (live weight) annually from 2011 to 2017 and are considered sustainable (Duffy and Gordon 2003, Braccini and Blay 2018, DPIRD 2020). In southern Australia, the species is captured as bycatch&#160;and mostly retained in the gillnet sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF); the mean annual catch was estimated at 17 t from 2000 to 2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/></p><p>  </p><p>In South Australia, the Copper Shark is taken as by-product and seasonally targeted in the multi-species Marine Scale Fish Fishery (MSF) (Bradshaw <em>et al.</em> 2018, Steer <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Copper Shark catch is combined with Dusky Sharks and reported as whaler sharks. Copper Sharks dominate the reported whaler shark catch accounting for ~80% and Dusky Sharks for ~20% (Rogers <em>et al.</em> 2013); although this proportion was based on only a few observed catches and the proportion of Copper Sharks may be greater (C. Huveneers, unpubl. data 2020). Since 1983, annual catches of whaler sharks have averaged ~80 t per annum but have stabilised at ~60 t per annum since 2012 (Bradshaw <em>et al. </em>2018, Steer <em>et al.</em> 2020). &#160;Regulations restricting catches of popular commercial and recreational species, i.e. King George Whiting (<em>Sillaginodes punctatus</em>) in 2017 and Snapper (<em>Chyrsophrys auratus</em>) in 2019, and a reform of the commercial marine scalefish fishery in 2020, may lead to a redistribution of fishing effort. It is unknown how this may affect Copper Sharks catches and population. In New South Wales (NSW), whaler shark catches are relatively stable with Copper Shark catches estimated as ~2 t per year, which represented 1.4% of the total allowable catch for large shark in NSW (Macbeth <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p><p></p>  <p>In New Zealand, the Copper Shark is taken as commercial and recreational catch, with much of the commercial catch taken by set nets in Haurki Gulf and Firth of Thames, however, it is rarely captured (Duffy and Gordon 2003, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2018). It was the most commonly landed whaler shark in the recreational fishery, with most of the catch released (Duffy and Gordon 2003).</p>  <p>In the Western Central Pacific (WCPO), the Copper Shark is reported as captured in both the longline and purse seine fisheries from 1995 to 2015 in large numbers of 5,713 and 2,710 individuals, respectively (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). However, the distribution of all the purse seine observed records and the majority of the longline observed records are in tropical waters of the WCPO where the Copper Shark does not occur and are likely misidentifications. Some observed longline records are in southeast Australia and New Zealand and may be records of the Copper Shark, however with the misidentification issue it is not possible to determine accurate catches </p>  <p>In the Eastern and Central Pacific, the Gulf of California (GC) has a long history of artisanal targeted shark fishing and sharks are also taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries in the Mexican Pacific (Duffy and Gordon 2003). The artisanal fisheries in Mexico are the dominant fishery accounting for 97% of the marine fishing fleet (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Copper Shark is taken in the targeted shark fishery, although based on reconstructed records, it occurs at a consistently relatively low abundance in the fishery with reconstructed landings estimates of 10–55 t from 1960 to 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In the southeast Pacific, in Peru, it is estimated that the combined shark landings increased from 1950 to 2010 and then significantly decreased from 2000 to 2011 at an estimated rate of 3.5% per year (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al. </em>2016). The Copper Shark is targeted in Peru longline fisheries but represented &lt;2% of the total shark landings from 1996 to 2010 and was reported to have a low catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.04–1.1 individuals per 100 hooks in northern and central areas from 1995 to 1997 (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016). The species accounted for &lt;1% of the total observed elasmobranch catch in small-scale fisheries from 2005 to 2010 (Doherty<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>    <p></p>","<p>Genetic studies reveal a structure between three regions separated by deep oceanic habitat that may indicate female philopatry and male mediated gene flow: Australasia (Australia–New Zealand) and Taiwan, Southern Africa (South Africa–Namibia) and Madeira (Portugal), and&#160;Peru (Benavides&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2011, Naylor <em>et al.</em> 2012). </p>  <p>Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006); and, (2) nominal CPUE in South Australia (Steer <em>et al.</em> 2020). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the CPUE from the KwaZulu-Natal bather protection netting program fluctuated but overall was considered stable from 1978–2003 (26 years) by Dudley and Simpfendorfer (2006), and appeared to be increasing. The trend data was analyzed over three generation lengths (71 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). The trend of this data revealed an annual rate of increase of 4.8%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 420.3% over three generation lengths (71 years), with the highest probability of increase over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). From 2003–2019, the CPUE has fluctuated but much less than in previous years and it has steadily declined (M. Dicken, unpubl. data 2020).<strong> </strong>Elsewhere in South Africa,  in False Bay, there were slight increases in the CPUE of Copper Shark  targeted in the commercial line fishery during 1985–2010 and in the  demersal longline fishery from 1992–2011 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013).  However, these increases were based on small sample sizes of 26 and 14  individuals, respectively and should be treated with caution. It is not  known if these changes reflect a true increase in the population or if  these estimated increases are influenced by seasonal migration (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>Secondly, in South Australia, catch-per-unit effort of whaler sharks (which is dominated by Copper  Shark) varied from ~90 to 210 kg/fisher/day, from 1994–2005 but has been  relatively stable at 100–150 kg/fisher/day from 2005–2018 (Steer <em>et al.</em>  2020). Age-structured models of longline and recreational catches showed that current harvest rate of Copper  Shark in South Australia is sustainable, but that population decline  may occur if catches increase in the future (Bradshaw <em>et al. </em>2018).   Longlines have been the dominant gear type since 2002 and thus the trend analysis used only&#160; longline CPUE for 2002–2018 (17 years). This revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 62.6% over three generation lengths (71 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. There is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the trend analysis due to a combination of the variable CPUE and the data representing less than one generation length. <br/></p><p>Additionally, in Australia, the standardized CPUE for catches of all Whaler Sharks  (which includes Copper Shark) in the New South Wales shark meshing  program (SMP) declined by ~75% from 1950–2018 (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Gibbs <em>et al. </em>2020).  This represents a reduction of ~76% when scaled to three generation  lengths of Copper Shark (71 years). Although the SMP long-term data is  not species-specific, it is informative for understanding the potential  levels of decline for the species in the region. Copper Shark accounted  for 14% of the total whaler shark catch since 1998 when whaler sharks  were identified to species level, and whaler sharks ranging from 13–54%  of the total catch from 1950–2010 (Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011). The  effort of the SMP is relatively minor compared to that of the commercial  fisheries in Australia. Elsewhere, across Australia, annual catches of the Copper Shark are  stable (Walker and Gason 2007, Braccini and Blay 2018).<br/><strong><br/></strong>In New Zealand (NZ), the estimated commercial catch of the Copper Shark declined from an annual peak of~48 t in the mid-1990s to 20 t in 2002 and then to a total of 44 t from 2008–2013 and a total of 6 t from 2011–2016 (Duffy and Gordon 2003, Ford <em>et al. </em>2015, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2018). No CPUE analysis of this species has been undertake in New Zealand. This decline in catches may be due to a reduction in set net fishing since the introduction of the quota management system in 1986 and the banning of set netting in large parts of its range (C. Duffy pers. comm. 01/06/2018). The Copper Shark is considered abundant in New Zealand with a relatively large population; adults are present in large numbers in coastal waters, but are rarely commercially captured (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2018, C. Duffy pers. comm. 1/06/2020). Anecdotal evidence of sport fishers and spear fishers suggest an increase in abundance around the upper North Island (C. Duffy pers. comm. 1/06/2020). Qualitative risk assessments considered the species to be stable or increasing in New Zealand waters, although with low confidence in the data (Ford <em>et al.</em> 2018), and the species was assessed as Not Threatened (NZ threat Classification System) and Least Concern (national Red List status) by Duffy<em> et al.</em> (2018) and Finucci <em>et al.</em> (2019), respectively. </p>  <p>In&#160;the Southwest Atlantic, recreational fishery catches of the Copper Shark in Anegada Bay, Argentina were the basis of an estimated population decline of 3–13% annually from 1998–2001, with the majority of the catch consisting of juvenile females (Lucifora 2003, Lucifora <em>et al.</em> 2005). There is no more recent population trend data available from the region.</p>  <p></p>        <p>In the Northwest Pacific, landings data on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) showed a 52% decline over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982"">–</a>2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Reconstructed catches based on landings data for combined sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 for the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs showed 98%, 67%, and 97% declines, respectively (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. In Japan, there has been a reduction in fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase (Pauly and Liang 2019). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (71 years) they represent declines of 55%, 99%, 70%, and 99% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.</p>  <p>In the Eastern Central Pacific, the Gulf of California (GC) reconstructed landings of the Copper Shark were estimated to range from 10–55 t annually from 1960–2014. These catches fluctuated, with an overall increase since 1960; there was a general increase from 10 t in 1960 to a peak of 55 t in 1980, a slow overall decline to ~10 t in 2000, and then an increase to ~30 t in 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2017). This trend follows that of the reconstructed catches for all shark landings from the GC fishery and with a lack of concurrent fisheries effort, it is possible the trends may be influenced by environmental factors that affect both the local species’ abundances and the capacity of the fleet to access fishing grounds, and market forces and management measures.&#160; These latter factors led to declines in fishing effort during the 1990s followed by specific shark fishery regulations in the 2000s that encourage sustainable fishing (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p>In the Southeast Pacific, in Peru, it is estimated that the combined shark landings increased from 1950–2010 and then significantly decreased from 2000–2011 at an estimated rate of 3.5% per year (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016). The limited effort data available for these Peruvian fisheries suggest that CPUE has declined during those latter years which suggests a decline in the Peruvian shark populations (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016). These levels of declines are not species-specific. The Copper Shark represented a small part of the total catch, at &lt;2% of the total shark landings from 1996–2010, and thus it is cannot be determined if the general shark decline trend would also have occurred in Copper Shark populations in the region.</p>  <p>The Copper Shark <a name=""_Hlk37078430"">appears to represent a small part of most of the reported shark catches </a><a name=""_Hlk37078500"">and it may have a naturally low abundance across most of its range</a>. Over three generation lengths (71 years) the Copper Shark population appears to have increased in South Africa, although the CPUE has declined in recent years, and is decreasing in South Australia and possibly New South Wales but is stable across the rest of Australia. The <a name=""_Hlk37078470"">population has </a> potentially increased in the Gulf of California, is<a name=""_Hlk37078470""> potentially increasing or stable in New Zealand, and has potentially declined in the Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Peru.</a> The potential increases and declines in all but the Northwest Pacific <a name=""_Hlk37078568"">cannot be definitively linked to changes in the actual abundance of the Copper Shark populations as there is little concurrent effort data and the changes may be due to environmental factors and changes in fishing practices. </a>In the Northwest Pacific, the Copper Shark is rarely reported, but the intense fisheries and declines in other shark species likely reflect actual declines in this species. <a name=""_Hlk37079390"">The most robust estimates are from the South Africa bather protection program where the population trend was increasing, but declining in more recent years, and the South Australian fisheries in Australia where the population trend was decreasing. Overall, a precautionary approach leads to a suspected population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (71 years).</a></p>",Decreasing,The Copper Shark has a circumglobal but patchy distribution (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a).,"The species is used for its high-quality meat and for the fins which accounted for 0.3% of fin samples in Hong Kong (Da Silva and Bürgener 2007, Drew <em>et al. </em>2017, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018).",Marine,"<p><strong><u></u></strong>There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for Copper Shark.

Its range between Brazil and Mexico remains uncertain. It occurs mainly on continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 20 m.&#160;Very little is known about the habitat and ecology of this species but it is assumed to be similar to American Cownose Ray which is among the least productive elasmobranchs. In the Northwest Atlantic, genetic analysis revealed the presence of Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico and both American and Brazilian Cownose Rays overlap geographically to a large degree across their range. The population trend was inferred from a fishery-independent trawl survey of the American Cownose Ray from the&#160;Gulf of Mexico&#160;which reveals the population increased through 1987–2010 but has been declining ever since, yet the overall estimated annual rate of increase is 2.5%, and a high probability of Least Concern (83%). In the Southwest Atlantic, however, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other species, and this species has disappeared from southern Brazil due to intense demersal trawl and beach seine fisheries from southern Brazil. In Venezuela, there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings.&#160;Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (43 years). Given the Southwest Atlantic occupies approximately one-half of the global range, that the species has extremely low biological productivity, and that it is also likely to be subject to undocumented fisheries in Central America, it is suspected that the Brazilian Cownose Ray has undergone a global population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths&#160;(43 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Brazilian Cownose Ray is a benthopelagic ray that occurs inshore over sandy bottoms, from nearshore to 20 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;This is considered a summer immigrant in southern Brazil following warmer water masses coming from the north of Brazil and reaching the shallow nearshore beaches along the state of Rio Grande do Sul between December to February which may be a nursery area for Brazilian Cownose Ray<em>&#160;</em>(G. Rincon pers. comm. 23/08/2020). The species reaches a maximum size of at least 104 cm disc width (DW); males and females mature at ~78 cm DW; 38–48 cm DW at birth (Last<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016). There is no habitat use or ecology information available for Brazilian Cownose Ray. However, it was inferred that Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;should be similar in life history to American Cownose Ray and thus assumed to have low productivity. Generation&#160;length was estimated as 14.3 years based on an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","In the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, the Brazilian Cownose Ray has been reported only from the Gulf of Mexico and assumed to have the same threats as American Cownose Ray, which is primarily taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls (J.K. Calson unpubl. data 2019). In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America along with largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are  widespread  and lack management and there is also a shallow-water  shrimp trawl  fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla  and A. Navia  unpubl. data 2018). This species is targeted there along  with other cownose and eagle rays. In Venezuela, commercial and  artisanal fisheries are  intense and lack management. Further, these fisheries have  exhibited peaks in catches  followed by declines, which is indicative of  sequential overfishing (Mendoza  2015). Groundfish  fisheries on the  Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000; these  fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with vessels  crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015). In northwestern  Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high  and 44% of target stocks  were likely to be overfished by the end of the  2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are   intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there   report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been   depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016).   In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a   period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over  650  vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).   Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted   by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed   (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species has no geographic   refuge from fishing within its range in Atlantic South America and does   not have refuge at depth.","In the Northwest Atlantic, genetic analysis of mitochondrial genes were used to confirm the presence of Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;in the Gulf of Mexico. Both American and Brazilian Cownose Ray&#160;overlap geographically to a large degree in the southern Gulf of Mexico (Palacios-Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2017). As there is no species-specific trend data available for this species in the northwest Atlantic, trend information for American Cownose Ray was inferred to represent Brazilian Cownose Ray. In the Gulf of Mexico, the relative abundance time-series based on analysis of a fishery-independent trawl survey from 1986 to 2018 (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) shows a steady increase in catch rate of American Cownose Ray to a peak around 2010, followed by a steady decline to the end of the time-series. Overall, abundance&#160;increased at an annual rate of change of +2.5%, but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened (NT = 3%, VU = 6%, EN = 7%, and CR = 1%, see Supplementary Information for&#160;<em><a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/60128/3088381"">Rhinoptera bonasus</a></em>).&#160;<br/><br/>In  Caribbean Colombia, there are no time-series of abundance but this  species is targeted in intense gillnet fisheries that are likely causing  a reduction in the population size there. <span class=""st"">In Venezuela, declines in the abundance of rays  including this species were reported as far back as the early 1970s  (Ginés <em>et al. </em>1972, cited in Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2012). There are unmanaged artisanal  gillnet fisheries that continue to capture species with broadly similar catchability (e.g. Whitespotted Eagle Ray<em> </em>(<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>)) (Tagliafico<em> et al.</em>  2012), and there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of <em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>, but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings&#160;(Tagliafico and Rago 2009).<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Data  are sparse in the Guianas, but it is suspected  that there have been  reductions in the population there as a result of  the level of  artisanal and commercial fishing pressure. <span class=""st"">There are no   data from northern Brazil, but commercial and artisanal fisheries are   intense, unmanaged, and have led to worrying declines in other species,   and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been   reduced in numbers in that area.

It inhabits the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 10–550 m. It is captured in commercial deep-water trawl, longline, and gillnet  fisheries, which operate throughout its known range. Little information  is available regarding the amount of catches due to identification issues. <em>Dipturus </em>spp. were the most abundant elasmobranchs caught in the monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>) deep-water gillnet fishery off southern Brazil, which intensified in the 2000s. These industrial gillnet fisheries often  also target skates, and have led to declines in other ecologically similar  species such as angel sharks (<em>Squatina </em>spp.). <em>Dipturus </em>spp.  were shown to be highly vulnerable to such fisheries in a  productivity-susceptibility analysis. There are also deep-water trawlers operating in the area targeting shrimp and squid, which are intense. Overall, due to the presence of intense and inadequately managed trawl   fisheries that operate throughout its range, it is suspected that the Thintail Skate has undergone a  population  reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (21  years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Thintail Skate is benthic on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 10–550 m (Weigmann 2016).

In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a     period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over   650   vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.  </em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks  targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those  being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). <em>Dipturus </em>spp. were the most abundant elasmobranchs caught in the monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>)  deep-water gillnet fishery off southern Brazil, which intensified in the  2000s (Perez and Wahrlich 2005). These industrial gillnet fisheries  often target skates, and have led to declines in other ecologically  similar species such as angel sharks (<em>Squatina </em>spp.) (Mafra Pio<em> et al.</em> 2016). <em>Dipturus </em>spp.  were shown to be highly vulnerable to such fisheries in a  productivity-susceptibility analysis (Visintin and Perez 2013).

In  Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the  late   1970s, and  many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2015). Trawl and gillnet fisheries also operate in Argentina and are intense in some areas. If this species does occur there, there is not likely much, if any, refuge from fishing. This skate is poorly known, and it may have a depth range deeper than is currently known and thus refuge at depth. Overall, as currently known, its range is subjected to intense and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has no refuge at depth.","In southern Brazil, fisheries are intense and are suspected to have led to declines in abundance there. In Uruguay, trawl landings are typically dominated by other skate species, but landings data are lumped into generic categories and management is not adequate; declines in abundance may have occurred there as a result. In Argentina, reported landings of skates in  general increased from 900  t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and  then declined to 24,000 t  in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y  Pesca 2010, cited  in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011).

It inhabits the continental shelf at depths of 3–149 m. It is captured in intensive artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout most of its geographic range, and is consumed or sold locally. This shark is highly valued and targeted in Venezuela because the meat is featured in many local dishes and has declined due to the absence of management and increasing demand. There has been a &gt;90% decline of this species in artisanal landings since the 1980s in Maranhão, northwest Brazil, equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;56% over three generation lengths (12 years).

Generation length is estimated at 4 years.","This shark is captured in artisanal gillnets, which are intense throughout most of its range. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there were an estimated 14,000 artisanal fishers there by 2006 (Wielgus <em>et al.</em> 2010). Since 1995, fishers have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al. </em>2015). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is landed regularly in large numbers in many areas of the country, particularly in the fishery off Margarita Island, and the level of mortality has caused concern there; management measures have not been implemented despite calls to do so (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2015). Guyana fisheries are dominated by subsistence and artisanal fisheries, which have been important since the government ban on seafood imports in 1971 (MacDonald <em>et al. </em>2015). There are artisanal fisheries that partially target sharks with gillnets and demersal longlines that began in the 1980s. There were ~600 artisanal vessels by 1998, and this species is commonly caught (Shing 1999). Market surveys there indicate that this species is still among the most common sharks in landings there (Kolmann<em> et al.</em> 2017). The situation is suspected to be similar in Suriname and French Guiana. In northwest Brazil, artisanal fishing pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In northeast and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are over-exploited, and other shark populations have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are over-exploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). Motta <em>et al.</em> (2005) reported that this species made up more than 60% of shark landings by number at one site in Sao Paulo state between 1996 and 1999. Overall, this shark is subjected to intense fishing pressure across its range, is targeted in many areas, and has no refuge at depth.","This species is subjected to intense exploitation in Colombia; there are no data but it is suspected that, in the absence of management measures, there has been a reduction in population size there, as seen for other similar species in the Caribbean&#160;(García <em>et al.</em> 2007). In Venezuela, this shark is still among the most captured in artisanal fisheries (Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2015), but it has likely declined due to the absence of management and increasing demand. Intense artisanal fishing in the Guianas has likely led to at least a moderate reduction in population size there. Northwest Brazil has some of the most intense fishing in the region, and, although this species is smaller and more productive than other species that have been depleted there, it is still suspected that this level of mortality has led to a reduction off that coast. For example, in Maranhão, there has been a decline of this species in artisanal landings of &gt;90% since the 1980s (R. Lessa pers. comm. 2018), which is equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;56% over three generations (12 years). In northwest Brazil, the combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several other larger elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In northeast Brazil, the Brazilian Sharpnose Shark was abundant in 1980, but has largely disappeared from landings (G. Rincon unpubl. data 2018). In eastern Brazil, other species with similar size and depth range have been depleted, and it is suspected that the population has been reduced in size there. In Sao Paulo State, the catch-per-unit-effort for this shark was stable between 1996 and 2002, but has declined since then (F. Motta unpubl. data 2018). Overall, due to the presence of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries across its range, noted declines in artisanal landings in many areas, and its relatively productive life history, it is suspected that the Brazilian Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (12 years).",Decreasing,"The Brazilian Sharpnose Shark occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to Santa Catarina state, Brazil (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","This shark is utilized as food where caught in artisanal fisheries.

Brazil is one of the biggest importers of shark meat (Dent and Clarke 2015), and this species may be included.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this species. In Colombia, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory and up to 5% in the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. Management measures including species-specific harvest control rules need to be implemented in order to ensure this species does not become more threatened in the near future. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and artisanal fisheries catch should be monitored at the species level.","",,false,false,Global
3088381,60128,Rhinoptera bonasus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2020,2019-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The American Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 110 cm disc width), coastal pelagic ray that migrates in large schools throughout its range in the Northwest, Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from Massachusetts, United States of America (USA) to Uruguay. It occurs mainly on continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 60 m. The American Cownose Ray is among the least productive elasmobranchs with a generation length of 14 years and an estimated median intrinsic rate of population growth rate r = 0.008. It is an opportunistic predator of benthic invertebrates but in the United States has long been persecuted&#160;due to perceptions they feed primarily on commercial bivalves leading to claims&#160;they led to the collapse of commercial bivalve populations along the USA East Coast through a trophic cascade. This led to the development of the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' fishery which was promoted by state fishery managers, seafood companies, some environmental organizations and local 'eco-friendly' restaurants&#160;as well as the development of tournaments to cull the “nuisance” cownose rays. Whereas American Cownose Ray did prey on historically abundant soft-shell clams (<em>Mya </em>spp.)<em>, </em>other commercial bivalves make up a very small proportion of the diet and collapse of the bivalve stocks were primarily due to overfishing and other causes. Following the publication of a rebuttal of the trophic cascade and the implication that American Cownose Rays caused the collapse of shellfish populations, the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign has declined in popularity. In the&#160;Gulf of Mexico,&#160;a relative abundance time-series of a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey reveals that the population increased through 1987–2010 and has been declining ever since yet the overall estimated annual rate of increase is 2.5% but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened. In the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to steep declines in other species, and there is no reason to suspect that this species has also not been reduced in numbers in that area. For example, there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings in Venezuela. Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (43 years) in that part of its range. Due to the increasing abundance in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of  Mexico, combined with suspected steep reductions in population size in  the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the American Cownose Ray has undergone an overall population reduction of 30–49% over the  past three generation lengths (43 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The American Cownose Ray is a large, benthopelagic ray that migrates in large schools throughout its range (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong>&#160;</strong>It occurs mainly on continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 60 m (Weigmann 2016).&#160;There are&#160;differences in some life history parameters between the Gulf of Mexico and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The species reaches a maximum size of ~110 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 64–85 cm DW, females mature at 62–92 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 20–43 cm DW (McEachran and de Carvalho 2002, Last<em> et al</em>. 2016). American Cownose Ray from the Gulf of Mexico mature more quickly (4–5 years) and at smaller sizes (64 cm disc width (DW) for males; 65 cm DW for females) than the Northwest Atlantic where females mature at 90–94 cm DW and 7–8 years in Chesapeake Bay (Smith and Merriner 1986,&#160;Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and litter size is typically one individual per female (98% of cases), with a gestation period of 11–12 months (Neer and Thompson 2005, Fisher&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013). Consequently, cownose rays are among the least productive elasmobranchs, with estimated intrinsic rate of population growth rates (r) ranging from −0.018 yr<sup>−1</sup> to 0.032 yr<sup>−1 </sup>(median r = 0.008) (Grubbs <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;Generation&#160;length was estimated as 14.3 years based on an age-at-maturity of 7.5 years and a maximum age of 21 years (Fisher&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).","In the United States, the American Cownose Ray had a long history of negative interactions with the commercial shellfish industry (Blankenship 1998). American Cownose Rays have been implicated in negatively affecting the recovery of Bay Scallop&#160;<strong>(</strong><em>Argopecten irradians</em>)&#160;stocks in North Carolina and oyster restoration and commercial aquaculture efforts in Chesapeake Bay. A mitigation attempt to decrease predation on shellfish resulted in an unregulated fishery for the American Cownose Ray (Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2013). Claims that the American Cownose Ray population increased dramatically due to top-down predation release (Myers <em>et al. </em>2007) led to the&#160;justification of the development of a fishery for American Cownose Rays as a form of predator control to decrease mortality rates on populations of commercially valuable bivalves. The 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign was touted as a way to restore the health of Chesapeake Bay by facilitating recovery of collapsed oyster populations. The fishery was promoted by state fishery managers, seafood companies, some environmental organisations, and regional 'eco-friendly' restaurants&#160;and there were many attempts to develop export markets for the meat in Europe and Asia. Due to limited markets for the meat, bowfishing tournaments developed in Virginia and Maryland as continued forms of perceived predator control.&#160;Following the publication of Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2016), which rebutted the trophic cascade and the implication that cownose rays caused the collapse of shellfish populations, the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign has declined in popularity.&#160;Maryland implemented a moratorium on the bowfishing tournaments for Cownose Ray, however&#160;there are many charter captains that take customers out to shoot Cownose Ray between Texas and Virginia (R.D. Grubbs pers. comm. 21/8/2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a seasonal, localised target fishery in Campeche Bay (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2012) and it is also taken as a small bycatch of fisheries in the Caribbean (M.P. Blanco-Parra<strong>&#160;</strong>unpubl. data 2019).&#160;Artisanal  fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,  and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries  in many areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread  and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl  fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia  unpubl. data 2018); this species is targeted there along with other cownose and eagle rays. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches  followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza  2015)<em></em>. Groundfish fisheries on the  Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these  fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels  crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). In northern  Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks  were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other elasmobranchs have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed  (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species has no geographic refuge from fishing in Atlantic South America, and does  not have refuge at depth.","Genetic analysis of mitochondrial markers shows significant differentiation between the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico (Carney <em>et al.</em> 2017). Population trend data are available from multiple data sources in the Gulf of Mexico (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker<em> et al.</em> 2018, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the Gulf of Mexico, the relative abundance time-series based on analysis of a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey from 1987 to 2018 (A.&#160;Pollack&#160;NOAA Fisheries, SEFSC, Mississippi Laboratories&#160;unpubl. data 2019) shows a steady increase in catch rate until a peak around 2010, followed by a steady decline to the end of the time-series. Overall, abundance&#160;increased at an annual rate of change of +2.5%, but while the probability of Least Concern is 83% there is a 14% probability that the population is threatened (NT = 3%, VU = 6%, EN = 7%, and CR = 1%).&#160;<br/><br/>In Caribbean Colombia, there are no time-series of abundance but this species is targeted in intense gillnet fisheries that are likely causing a reduction in the population size there.&#160;<span class=""st"">In Venezuela, declines in the abundance of rays including this species were reported as far back as the early 1970s (Ginés&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1972, cited in Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). There are unmanaged artisanal gillnet fisheries that continue to capture species with broadly similar catchability (e.g. Whitespotted Eagle Ray,&#160;<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>) (Tagliafico<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012), and there is a long history photographic records of past landings of schools of&#160;<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em>&#160;but they have completely disappeared from recent fishery landings&#160;(Tagliafico and Rago 2009). There are no  data from northern Brazil, but commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense, unmanaged, and have led to worrying declines in other species,  and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been  reduced in numbers in that area. Due to  the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some  areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, it is suspected that this species has  undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three  generation lengths (43 years)&#160;in the Atlantic South American part  of its range.<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> Due to the increasing abundance in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, combined with suspected steep reductions in population size in the southern Caribbean and Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the American Cownose Ray has undergone an overall population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (43 years). <br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""><span><span class=""st""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The American Cownose Ray occurs widely in the Northwest, Western Centra and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from Massachusetts, USA to Uruguay&#160;(Last <em>et al. </em>2016) and seems to co-occur with congener the Brazilian Cownose Ray <em>Rhinoptera brasiliensis</em>&#160;in Brazil, from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina State (Gallo-da-Silva&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997 in Menni and Stehmann 2000) and in the southern Gulf of Mexico (Palacios-Barreto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","Generally, cownose and eagle rays are caught as utilised bycatch of artisanal fisheries and the meat is consumed locally fresh or salted (Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).

In the USA, the American Cownose Ray has long been regarded as a pest by the commercial shellfish industry (see Threats) and when harvested under predator control programs are usually discarded dead. Under the 'Save the Bay, Eat a Ray' campaign, Cownose Ray wings were marketed for consumption in regional seafood restaurants in Virginia and Maryland, USA (Grubbs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). This species was promoted and sold&#160;much further afield; it was sold in restaurants in New York City, promoted at the Boston Seafood Show, and it was even being promoted at a seafood show in Brussels (R.D.

There are no species-specific protections or management measures in place in the southern Caribbean or South America. Further research is needed on taxonomy, life history, population size and trend, and threats. All fisheries should be managed for bycatch at the species level.","",,false,false,Global

However, in Cuba and Costa Rica, there has been an inferred decline in abundance based on a reduction in catches of Atlantic Nurse Shark  despite fishing effort remaining stable. In addition, in other areas of Central America there has been a significant loss of habitat (e.g. coral reefs), which this species relies on and this may contribute to the decline in observations. In the majority of its range, the Atlantic Nurse Shark is targeted and/or captured as bycatch in  commercial, recreational, and artisanal coastal fisheries, including in trawls, beach  seines, gillnets, longlines, and handlines. These fisheries are largely unmanaged and are intensifying in areas outside the USA. It is often retained for its meat and fins, and for its skin for leather.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged coastal commercial and artisanal fisheries, the rapid and severe decline in other shallow-water coastal elasmobranchs, intense human development that has caused coastal habitat degradation, and the ongoing effects of climate change on coral habitat, it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80%. The Atlantic Nurse Sharks are never targeted in West Africa but when caught they are retained and processed by salt-drying (Ghanaian processors) or by smoking (Guinean processors) and sold in West African markets. Large individuals were observed in the 1990s in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea, with sizes frequently exceeding 250 cm total length. However, there has been an observed decrease since 2000 in abundance, landings, and average sizes, with a very significant reduction in the proportion of adult females.

The Atlantic Nurse Shark&#160;is also captured by spear fishers for the aquarium and ornamental fish trade. Human impacts on coral reefs, including degradation and destruction due to fishing practices, pollution, and nutrient loading from run-off, and bleaching due to climate change threaten this species' habitat.","There are no range-wide population size estimates for the Atlantic Nurse Shark.

Since 2008, all shark species have been fully protected in the Seaﬂower Biosphere Reserve, banning ﬁshing and possession of all sharks and their byproducts. These has led to one of the highest shark abundance found in the Caribbean Sea. Local communities pushed for these shark conservation measures in the Archipelago, simplifying the enforcement by local authorities. Enforcement in remote regions against poaching has been challenging, although the Colombian Navy has been leading the enforcement of these areas and has enabled scientiﬁc data collection. In addition, Colombia has banned wire-leader on their longlining ﬁsheries as a bycatch-reduction measure across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where industrial ﬁsheries are only allowed to have a total shark by catch of 35% in a single ﬁshing trip.

It is benthic on the continental shelf on soft substrates at 0–130 m depth<em>,</em> and is associated with mesophotic reefs. It is captured in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal  demersal trawl fisheries throughout its geographic range. This genus only has some refuge at depth from fishing in Colombia, and much of this species' range extends beyond Colombia into countries where it is exposed to fishing mortality throughout its depth range. The association with mesophotic reefs suggests there may be some refuge from major fishing gears. Due to the level of fisheries mortality that this species is exposed to   across its geographic and most of its depth range, offset by with its small size and likely relatively   productive life history and some refuge at depth in Colombia, it is suspected that the Painted Dwarf Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past   three generations (13.5 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Painted Dwarf Numbfish is benthic on the continental shelf over soft substrates from close inshore to 130 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016), and is often associated with mesophotic coral reefs (G. Rincon unpubl. data 2018). It reaches a maximum size of at least 18 cm total length (TL), but little else is known about its life history (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is suspected to be ~4.5 years, based on data available for the related Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>),  which has a larger maximum size of 75 cm TL, an age-at-maturity of 6 years, a maximum age of 15 years, and thus a generation length of 10.5  years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000).","The Painted Dwarf Numbfish is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal trawl fisheries, which are intense and largely unmanaged across its limited range. In Colombia, industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). In the mid-2000s this fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world (Duarte <em>et al. </em>2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal fish species was introduced there in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and shrimp landings peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman et al. 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Reported and reconstructed landings in Venezuela increased substantially from the 1960s until the early 2000s, followed by severe declines in the years since (Mendoza 2015). Since the 2009 industrial trawl ban, artisanal trawl fleets have expanded substantially, with little management and no monitoring in place. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were over 130 trawl vessels of various sizes operating off the west and south coasts of Trinidad by 2011 (Mohammed <em>et al. </em>2011). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some spatial closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos<em> et al.</em> 2011). This combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in has led to the near-disappearance of several larger elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Overall, this species is subjected to intense trawling pressure across its range. There is likely to be some refuge at depth in Colombia, where trawling is restricted to shallow inshore waters.","Due to the level of fishing pressure that this species is exposed to  across its range, offset by its small size and likely relatively  productive life history, it is suspected that the Painted Dwarf  Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past  three generations (13.5 years). <br/><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p>",Decreasing,"The Painted Dwarf Numbfish occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Colombia to the mouth of the Amazon River in Pará, Brazil (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019,&#160;Mejía-Falla, P.A. and Navia, A.F. unpubl. data 2020).","Members of this genus were typically discarded when caught in trawls (Acevedo <em>et al.</em> 2007). This species is not utilized in Colombia, and is unlikely to be utilized elsewhere given its small size.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this numbfish. A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is inadequate. Management and mitigation of bycatch is needed in order to ensure this species does not become more threatened in the near future.&#160;Further research is needed on distribution and population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring should be undertaken in commercial and artisanal fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and 58% of target stocks were overexploited by 2010, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species is caught in gillnets there and in one study from the late 1990s, it made up 18.4% of the shark catch by number, the second most caught species in that fishery (Motta <em>et al. </em>2005). In Atlantic South America, this species is subjected to heavy and unmanaged artisanal fishing pressure, and may be increasingly targeted as a result of the depletion of larger sharks (Almanza Bernal 2014). Although it may have the ability to withstand some level of fishing pressure due to its small size and relatively fast life history, there is no geographic or bathymetric refuge from fishing for this

of the mitochondrial DNA control region has revealed strong  genetic structure that distinguishes between individuals from the  Southern Equatorial Current and individuals from the Brazil current  (i.e. a boundary at the northeasternmost tip of Brazil), and that these  portions of the population should be treated as separate management  units (<span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto"">Mendonça&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). There are few population data for Caribbean Sharpnose Shark&#160;and the challenges of species identification in areas where it overlaps with Atlantic Sharpnose Shark can confound estimates of abundance. All estimates of population status are inferred based on catches and level of effort. For example, since 2005, fishing effort in Mexico appears to be decreasing and catches of Caribbean Sharpnose Shark&#160;are stable in Mexican Caribbean waters (J.C. Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). In Guatemala, monitoring of catches over the last 5 years has reported very few catches except during religious holidays (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Belize and Honduras, it is also one of the most abundant species captured as bycatch and in directed artisanal fisheries. However, the average size of captures are about the age of maturity which suggests growth overfishing is not occurring (E. Espinoza unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In Atlantic South America, there are no time-series of abundance. In Caribbean Colombia, this species is still widespread and caught commonly in fisheries, but has been listed as Near Threatened due to the level of exploitation it is exposed to there. Fishing pressure has also decreased in the insular region of Caribbean  Colombia. In Venezuela there are no data, but this species is captured in large numbers in artisanal fisheries there, which lack management. The situation is suspected to be similar in the Guianas, but there are no data. This shark is common in Guyana and the fishing effort there has  remained consistent (D. Cardeñosa unpubl. data 2019). In northeastern Brazil, this shark is being increasingly targeted due to the depletion of other larger sharks, and it is suspected that this fishing pressure is leading to a reduction in population size there. It is also caught in large numbers in the intense artisanal gillnet fisheries further south in Brazil, and it is likely that the lack of management there has led to population reduction (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2019).&#160;<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/><br/><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Due to the actual levels of exploitation by   widespread artisanal and commercial fisheries, which mostly lack adequate management particularly in the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that this shark has undergone an overall population   reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (14 years).<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><br/><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span><span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""><br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Caribbean Sharpnose Shark occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from the Bahamas, Caribbean Islands, and Quintana Roo, Mexico to Uruguay (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). <span data-field-selector=""creator""><span dir=""auto""></span>","Caribbean Sharpnose Sharks are valued for their meat which is likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold      locally in most places. Brazil does import shark meat under  the     general name <em>cação</em>, which is in high demand (Dent and Clarke 2015). Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015, Caribbean Sharpnose Shark&#160;and Atlantic Sharpnose Shark combined compose 0.35% of the fin trade (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for the Caribbean Sharpnose Shark.

The Kitefin Shark is taken incidentally in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries across its range. The species was once targeted in European fisheries, but these fisheries have since closed due to evidence of collapse. Species-specific management actions are established across its range in the Northeast Atlantic, and fisheries restrictions in Australia may indirectly offer some refuge in this region. Where intensive fishing occurs, depletion levels are likely to be consistent with documented declines in core areas of abundance,&#160;and overall, the global population is inferred to have declined by at least 30%. With much of its distribution still susceptible to fishing, it is inferred that population declines will continue in the future. At this time, the Kitefin Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd+3d.","The Kitefin Shark is a deepwater, benthic to mesopelagic species, recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths from 37-1,800 m, but mainly &gt;200 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 182 cm total length (TL); males mature ~100 cm TL; females mature ~120 cm TL; size at birth 30-40 cm TL. Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous; presumably asynchronous; and litter size is 3-16 pups (average 6-8) (Daley<em> et al.</em> 2002, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is estimated to be 29 years (estimated from age data from <em>Deania</em> in Irvine<em> et al.</em> 2012).","The Kitefin Shark has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries (ICES 2006, Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>The Kitefin Shark is taken incidentally in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries (Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015). In New Zealand, Kitefin Shark catches are generally associated with Hoki (<em>Macruronus novaezelandiae</em>), Ling (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) fisheries, and have been most frequently recorded at depths &gt;1,000 m (Blackwell 2010). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches of this species are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). It is likely that catches of this species and other shark species (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp., <em>Etmopterus </em>spp.) were historically aggregated under a generic code in both Australia and New Zealand (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Blackwell 2010). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from commercial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with high risk from commercial fishing (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>This species was previously reported in longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deepwater sharks west of the British Isles and off the Portuguese mainland (ICES 2006), but the gillnet fisheries have since closed and targeted fishing is now prohibited (ICES 2016). Kitefin Shark has also been reported from mixed deepwater trawl fisheries west of the British Isles, although catches were unknown, but presumed to be low. In the Mediterranean, the Kitefin Shark has been caught incidentally in benthic trawl targeting Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>). This species has likely been previously misidentified with other large deepwater sharks, including Portuguese Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>) and Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) (ICES 2006). Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES 2016) (see Walls and Guallart 2015, 2016 for more information).<br/><p></p>","Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. The Kitefin Shark is believed to be relatively common yet low in abundance, and there is likely to be little to no exchange between areas separated by the deep ocean or occurring in different ocean basins, which are considered to form distinct regional subpopulations (Compagno and Cook 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>The Kitefin Shark is considered to have a relatively large population in New Zealand (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). An indicator analysis using trawl survey data, commercial catch-effort, and observer data produced conflicting results and the status of this species is uncertain (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Adult individuals are not well monitored by trawl surveys, and indices showed no trends on Chatham Rise (1992-2010) or Sub-Antarctic (1991-1993, 2000-2009) (O’Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bagley <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), Kitefin Shark has declined by 87% over 13 years (1994-2006, standardized CPUE) (Walker and Gason 2007), which equates to a decline of &gt;99% over 3 generations (87 years).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>The subpopulation size or structure is unknown in the Northeast Atlantic, however, for the purposes of stock assessment and management, the Azores/Mid-Atlantic Ridge subpopulation is considered to be separate from the Northeast Atlantic slope subpopulation (ICES 2006, ICES 2013). The overall trend in European waters for this species seems to be of a general decrease. Targeted fisheries in the Azores peaked at 937 t in 1984 and 896 t in 1991 (ICES 2016). After 1991, reported landings declined linearly until the fishery was closed at the end of the 1990s due to stock collapse, and remains collapsed in the Azores region (ICES 2016). For the Northeast Atlantic slope subpopulation, a comparison between recent Scottish trawl surveys and United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) surveys in the 1970s showed a 94% observed decline in catch rate. However, this value must be treated with caution as it is likely that other species were mistakenly identified as this species in the initial 1970s survey (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, the Scottish trawl surveys took place at the limit of this species’ geographical range, which may explain the observed low catch rates (see Walls and Guallart 2015 for more information).<br/><br/>Preliminary assessment results from the Development of Elasmobranch Assessments (DELASS) in the Mediterranean Sea suggested the stock may be depleted to about 50% of virgin biomass. Considering a 50% decline for the 1972-2001 period, and assuming exponential decline, the annual proportional change would be 0.9764. Therefore, the reduction for the time period 1972-2059 (87 years, three generations) is 87%. When projecting this decline into the future (2017-2104, three generations), a 64% decline is estimated. In the central Mediterranean Sea, data collected between 1972-2004 from the Gruppo Nazionale Dermersali (GRUND) experimental trawl surveys reported a 15% decline. Assuming exponential decline, the annual proportional change would be 0.9949 and therefore, the reduction for the time period 1972–2059 (87 years, three generations) is 36%. When projecting this decline into the future (2017-2104, three generations), a decline of 36% is also estimated. Assuming that the proportion of the population present in the Mediterranean and in the Northeast Atlantic is roughly equal, an overall reduction of 62% is calculated for European waters for the 1972-2059 period (87 years, three generations). A reduction of 52% is projected for the 2017-2104 period (87 years, three generations) into the future (see Walls and Guallart 2016 for more information).<br/><br/>The extent of fishing outside these areas is unknown. Where intensive fishing occurs (e.g. West Africa, Taiwan), depletion levels are likely to be consistent with documented declines in core areas of abundance, and overall, the global population is inferred to have declined by at least 30%.",Decreasing,The Kitefin Shark has a widespread yet patchy distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-West and Central Pacific Oceans (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).,"The Kitefin Shark is utilized for its flesh, squalene-rich liver oil, fishmeal, and leather (Compagno 2016). Discarding rates of this species vary by region.",Marine,"Further information is required on population size and trends of the Kitefin Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Southwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian, and the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>New Zealand has had a Quota Management System (QMS) in place since 1986 to provide for the sustainable management of its fisheries. The Kitefin Shark is a non-QMS species, meaning that there is no species-specific management in place for the species (MPI 2013). New Zealand has a system of Benthic Protected Areas (BPAs), however they are unlikely to provide any major refuge for this species given the spatial occurrence of the BPAs (see Black and Tilney 2015). In Australia, catches of Kitefin Shark are controlled by basket trip limits to prevent targeted fishing (Walker and Gason 2007). In Australia, a combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2016), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean<br/></strong>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for Kitefin Shark in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES 2016). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deepwater shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius </em>spp.) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deepwater fishing in 2010 (ICES 2016). In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a ban on deepwater fishing below 1,000 m depth, which may offer limited indirect refuge from fishing, however the species is regarded as open-access in this region (see Walls and Guallart 2015, 2016 for more information).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It occurs on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 10–481 m (most abundant at depths &lt; 200 m). The American Elephantfish is caught as targeted and incidental catch by handline, and demersal gillnet, trawl, and longline, and is fished year-round throughout most of its depth and distribution. Some fisheries management arrangements are in place across part of its range. Considerable population reduction has been reported from ~25% of its range (i.e. half of its Southeast Pacific range), however this is not considered to be representative across the entire range of the species and trends in the Southwest Atlantic appear to be stable at this time.&#160;Given the high degree of overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range but stable trends in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range, a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;is suspected over the last three generations (53 years) based on actual levels of exploitation, thus meeting Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The American Elephantfish has been found from coastal waters to the upper continental slope at depths of 10–481 m, and is most abundant at depths &lt; 200 m. It reaches a maximum length of 102 cm total length (TL) (Di Giácomo and Perier 1994). Maturity appears to vary by region; male maturity occurs at 43–44 cm standard length (SL) and between 3–6 years of age; female maturity occurs at 47–50 cm SL and between 5–9 years of age (Alarcón <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2018b). Size-at-birth is 13 cm total length (TL). Lifespan is estimated at ~14 and ~21 years for males and females, respectively (Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2015a), and may be as high as 28 years (Alarcón <em>et al</em>. 2011). Like other chimaeras, it is oviparous. Ovarian fecundity is estimated at ~8.4 (Chierichetti <em>et al</em>. 2017). Based on catch compositions, the species appears to have discreet spawning areas and seasons. In the Gulf of San Matías, Argentina, the primary spawning season is from July to November (Di Giácomo and Perier 1994). Generation length of this species is estimated at 17.5 years.<br/></p>","The American Elephantfish is caught as targeted and incidental catch by hand line, and demersal gillnet, trawl, and longline (Quiroz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lamilla <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2015b). It is fished year-round throughout most of its depth and distribution, and is an important resource for recreational and small artisanal fisheries (Alarcón <em>et al</em>. 2011, Venerus and Cedrola 2017). As bycatch, it is often recorded in commercial fisheries for shrimp species (e.g. <em>Pleoticus muelleri</em>), and Hake (<em>Merluccius </em>hubbsi) (Lamilla <em>et </em>al. 2008, Góngora <em>et al</em>. 2009), and is often one of the most recorded and landed chondrichthyans (e.g. Jaureguizar <em>et al</em>. 2015, Núñez <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, the industrial fishing fleet of Uruguay increased from 46 vessels in 1975 to a peak of 121 in 2004, followed by a decline to 81 vessels in 2010 (Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2015). During the expansion phase of this fishery, landings increased six-fold from 1975 to 1981. Subsequent depletion of target species led to a diversification of the fisheries into non-traditional (i.e. bycatch) species, including American Elephantfish, masking the decline in previous target species (Lorenzo <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Argentina, fisheries have been characterized by declining catches, a shift to species of lower trophic levels, and an increase in catch coming from overexploited stocks (Villasante et al. 2015, Pauly and Zeller 2015). Nearly two thirds of all stocks were overexploited or collapsed in 2014 (Pauly and Zeller 2015). The Argentinian hake fishery has 566 trawlers in operation and these vessels catch a high proportion of bycatch, including American Elephantfish. <br/><br/>In the Southeast Pacific, American Elephantfish is taken in Chilean artisanal and industrial fisheries (SUBPESCA 2018). Industrial landings peaked in 1994 at 7.5 million t, followed by declines to 3.6 million t in 2010 (Van der Meer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Artisanal fisheries are widespread along the Chilean coastline, accounting for nearly half of all fish and crustacean landings in the country. Monitoring of these landings, however, is poor, and likely to be under-reported (Van der Meer <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Population size and structure of the American Elephantfish is unknown. Discreet subpopulations may exist as there are regional differences in life history parameter estimates.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, nearly all landings (97%) of the species are reported from Argentina, which have been increasing since 1992 (Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2015a, 2015b). Between 2006 and 2016, landings have steadily increased, with an average annual landing of 2,000 t (highest in 2009 at 2,782 t). It is thought this increase in landings is a result of fleet dynamics rather than an increase in population abundance (Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2018a). From 1992 to 2015, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates of this species in Argentina (based on the number of vessels operating and landings in two fleets) show large fluctuations and no real trend (National Secretary for Fisheries, Argentina Fisheries Statistics 2017). <br/><br/>In the Southeast Pacific, landings of the American Elephantfish in Chile have varied considerably and appear to correspond with commercial fishing effort. Maximum landings were reached between 1988 and 1992 (as high as 4,729 t), followed by a sharp decline in 1993–1994, and fluctuations around 1,000 t until 2007. Between 1986–2008, in fishing Regions IV to X (accounting for 99% of landings), American Elephantfish biomass was estimated to have declined from ~24,000 to ~3,000 t (Aedo et al. 2010). This equates to a &gt;99% reduction over three generations (53 years) in a considerable proportion (~50%) of its known Southeast Pacific distribution. Standardized CPUE have shown fluctuations or no real trends in abundance between 2002 and 2008, suggesting this decline may have stabilized. Nonetheless, current fishing mortality was estimated to exceed reference fishing mortality (Aedo <em>et al</em>. 2010). <br/><br/>It is worth noting that fluctuations in catch have been observed in the conspecific Elephantfish (<em>Callorhinchus milii</em>), although species-specific management action (e.g. Total Allowable Catches, TACs) has been implemented for some time (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Furthermore, declines of the Elephantfish in New Zealand were reported prior to its introduction into the Quota Management System (QMS) (MPI 2017). <br/><br/>Given the high degree of overlap with intensive fishing pressure, biomass declines in the Southeast Pacific, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range, a population reduction of 30–49% globally over the last three generations (53 years) is suspected based on actual levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"<p>The American Elephantfish is known from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to southern Patagonia in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean and from Ecuador to Chile in the Southeast Pacific Ocean (López <em>et al</em>. 2000, Swing and Béarez 2006, Di Dario <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/></p>","<p>The species is utilized for its flesh and fins in local and international trade (INIDEP 2018, SUBPESCA 2018).<br/></p>",Marine,"There are some species-specific and general management arrangements for the American Elephantfish. <br/><br/>In Argentina, management implementations include gear restrictions and recreational bag limits, as well as mandatory release inside the Punta Bermeja Natural Protected Area (Rio Negro Province) (Venerus and Cedrola 2017). Daily recreational catch limits have been implemented for chondrichthyans in Buenos Aires Province waters (Act Num. 217/07, Fishery Secretary), including the American Elephantfish (two fish per day). A temporary closure area (November to March) has also been established in El Rincón (Buenos Aires Province) to protect aggregations of the American Elephantfish and other species (Bernasconi <em>et al</em>. 2018a). <br/><br/>Since 2013, the Argentine Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) imposed a maximum commercial catch limit for chondrichthyans (no more than 50% of total landings per fishing trip and no more than 50% of catch per trawl operation), and individuals must be landed whole (Act Num. 7/2013, Consejo Federal Pesquero 2013; Act Num. 9/2013, Comisión Técnica Mixta del Frente Marítimo).<br/>In Chile, the species is open-access (Aedo <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Reproduction is oviparous, and annual fecundity is estimated at 62–124 egg cases per year (Oddone and Capapé 2011). Egg-laying occurs from November to July, with a peak in January and February in southern Brazilian waters (Peres and Vooren 1993). Maximum age is estimated at 10 years for females and 6 years for males (Caltabellotta <em>et al. </em>2019). Generation length is suspected to be about 8 years, based on data available for the related Whitedotted Skate (<em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 10 years, a maximum age of 17 years, and thus a generation length of 13.5 years (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2005).","The Rio Skate is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal trawl fisheries which are intensive throughout its range (Casarini 2006<em>, </em>Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2011, Port <em>et al. </em>2016).   In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a    period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over  650   vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em>  2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were overexploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues<em> et al. </em>2019). In  Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the  late  1970s, and  many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). By 1992, there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). Prior to the mid-1990s, skates were discarded in Argentina but retention increased rapidly to supply the Asian markets and led to increased pressure (Chiaramonte 2014). Overall, this species is subjected to intense fishing pressure across its range, and it has no refuge at depth.","Research trawl surveys in southern Brazil indicated a decline in landings of this species of 50% between 1980 and 2005 or about three generation lengths (Ferreira <em>et al.</em> 2010). Lessa <em>et al.</em> (1999) had already reported that the proportion of this species had declined in captures and that there was likely a population reduction by then. In the Uruguayan fisheries statistics for the coastal industrial trawler fleet, this species was originally included in the generic category 'skates' which refers mostly to the Smallnose Fanskate (<em>Sympterygia bonapartii</em>); however since 2014 a new category 'coastal rays' has been reported on. Landings have been variable but went from over 75 t in 2014 to 17 t in 2016, and then up again to 57 t in 2018 (CTMFM 2018). In Argentina, reported landings of skates in  general increased from  900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and  then declined to  24,000 t in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y  Pesca  2010, cited in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). The Rio Skate occurred frequently in trawls in a 2007–2009 study there that found they were present in 22% of sampled landings, but was negligible in terms of its relative numeric abundance and weight (Estalles <em>et al.</em>  2011). Overall, due to the presence of intense and inadequately managed trawl fisheries that operate throughout its range and declines in landings of skates in general in several areas, balanced with a relatively wide geographic and depth range, it is suspected that the Rio Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (24 years).",Decreasing,"The Rio Skate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from <span class=""st"">Esp<span class=""st""><span class=""st"">írito Santo state, Brazil, to the San Mat<span class=""st"">ías Gulf, Chubut, Argentina<span class=""st""><span class=""st""> (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/><p>&#160;</p></span></span></span>","This skate is taken as a utilized bycatch where caught, and is consumed  or sold locally or exported to Asia.

Four main fisheries (hook and line, demersal gillnet, pots, and demersal trawls) targeted a variety of species including Monkfish (<em>Lophyus gastrophysus</em>), Argentine Hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>), and deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae) at depths of 200–1,000 m+.&#160;Foreign vessels also operated in the region until 2002, fishing at depths predominately &gt;500 m (Perez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;Development of these fisheries was intense; the entire area fished for deep-water shrimps species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three year period (2003–2006), reducing biomass estimates of the target species&#160;<em>Aristaeopsis edwardsiana</em>&#160;by up to 50% (Dallagnolo&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;Fishing activities mostly ceased in 2006, but may return at any point in the future due to the dynamic nature of Brazilian fisheries.</p><p>These fisheries have operated across the entire known geographical and bathymetrical range of the Striped Rabbitfish (e.g. Perez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Mafra Pio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016, Port&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species was infrequently observed, but was reported as bycatch in the deep-water shrimp trawl fishery (Perez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), and likely in the Monkfish gillnet fishery as well (recorded as&#160;<em>Hydrolagus&#160;</em>sp.)

As part of the Monkfish management plan, two no-take areas were established off southeast and southern Brazil in 2001 and 2002 (Perez 2007), which may provide some refuge for the Striped Rabbitfish.  Given its restricted known distribution, the conservation status of this species may rely heavily upon the success of these management arrangements.

In the United States, Roughtail Stingray may be caught as bycatch by recreational anglers where it is likely killed due to the danger of its spine. However, the level of mortality is likely low. Roughtail Stingray is caught as bycatch in artisanal shrimp trawl fisheries in southern Mexico but is generally discarded alive (J.C. Pérez-Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). It is also caught in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico in artisanal gillnets (Wakida-Kusunoki <em>et al. </em>2018). Habitat loss due to tourism and coastal development is an issue in the Quintana Roo region of Mexico (M.P. Blanco-Parra pers. comm. 2019).Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other elasmobranchs have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016). This species is caught by shrimp trawlers off Sergipe State (Barreto <em>et al. </em>2018). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006).

It is primarily a coastal species&#160;that does not usually penetrate very far inland and is mainly found in low altitude areas close to the south and west coasts of both main islands.&#160;<em>G. argenteus</em>&#160;is migratory, but&#160;it can form land-locked populations and therefore has the capacity for both diadromous and non-diadromous recruitment. This species has undergone significant population declines since European settlement times&#160;and it has been locally extirpated in parts of its former range.&#160;Loss and degradation of habitat through activities such as drainage of wetlands and straightening of river channel systems are the biggest threat to this species. Current and historic land-use change and intensification has resulted in an incremental loss of habitat. Around 85% to 90% of New Zealand's wetlands have been lost in the last 100 years and this species is now essentially absent from most of&#160;New Zealand's intensively utilised lowland plains.&#160;There is a continuing expansion of dairy farming and associated drain management practices in stronghold areas for this species. The mechanical clearance of drains causes direct mortality through the removal and stranding of fish on banks. Drain clearing occurs extensively in the Waikato and Southland and is increasingly occurring on the West Coast, as land use changes to more intensive dairy farming. Here, the impacts on the <em>G</em>.&#160;<em>argenteus</em>&#160;are expected to be severe. Although specific data on the rates of population decline are unavailable, it is reasonable to assume on the basis of past and on-going habitat loss and human pressures that the population has experienced at least a 25% decline over the past 20 years (2 generations). Furthermore, a confounding aspect of this species' life history is that large, old fecund specimens could be sustaining the population in the face of habitat loss and drain clearing mortalities and a 10-20 year lag may be weakening the current observations of a decline. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that that the population will experience further declines of at least 5% over the next 10 years (1 generation). Based on these suspected population decline rates in the past and the predicted future population declines, this species has been assessed as Vulnerable, where the cause of declines are due to a decline in the area of occupancy,&#160;extent of occurrence and habitat quality.","<em>G. argenteus</em> is the largest of the galaxiid species, reaching a total length of 580 mm, but is now uncommonly seen greater than 400 mm. This is primarily a coastal species&#160;that does not usually penetrate very far inland. It&#160;is mainly found in low altitude areas close to the south and west coasts of both main islands. Preferred habitat includes small-medium size, slow-flowing streams, although it can also occur in non-flowing aquatic habitats such as wetlands, ponds and lake margins. They are also usually found in habitats with good cover from overhanging vegetation, undercut banks, logs or debris clusters. This large galaxiid is migratory but, like Koarao (<em>Galaxias brevipinnis</em>)<em>&#160;</em>and Banded Kokopu (<em>Galaxias fasciatus</em>), it can form land-locked populations and therefore has the capacity for both diadromous and non-diadromous recruitment. They are cryptic, mostly nocturnal fish that mature at 2-3 years of age, with the oldest recorded specimen aged at between 21-27 years of age (McDowall 1990). Generation time is estimated at 10 years (B. David pers. comm. 2014). Spawning occurs in autumn/winter during elevated flows, with eggs deposited in riparian vegetation. Eggs develop terrestrially before hatching 3-6 weeks later when re-inundated by high flows. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in some streams short-term downstream migrations may occur for spawning (Franklin pers. comm. 2014). Larvae typically rear at sea and return after 4-6 months to freshwater as whitebait. Whitebait are able to climb, but not as well as some other whitebait species. This species has a diverse diet including terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, freshwater crayfish and sometimes other fish (McDowall 1990, Department of Conservation 2010, NIWA 2013).","Loss and degradation of habitat through activities such as drainage of wetlands and straightening of river channel systems are the biggest threat to this species. Current and historic land use change and intensification has resulted in an incremental habitat loss for this species. Around 85% to 90% of New Zealand's wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years&#160;(Ministry for the Environment 1997) and this species is&#160;now essentially absent from most of New Zealand's intensively utilised lowland plains. Mechanical clearance of drains causes direct mortality, where this wide scale drain 'management' is known to directly remove and strand fish on the banks. There is a continuing expansion of dairy and associated drain management in stronghold areas (e.g. Waituna Lagoon complex area and Lake Brunner area) for this species. In some regions (e.g. Waikato), on-going drain management is continually suppressing the potential for these areas to be recolonised. There is on-going pressure to increase efforts to clear drains in these key regions and the impacts on the population here will be severe (Greer <em>et al.</em> 2012). Also, areas that have been recolonized (following long periods of no drain disturbance) are subjected to being uprooted and this has been observed on numerous occasions in the Waikato region, since about 2002 (David pers. comm. 2014). Crucially, on top of the direct removal of fish, the remaining habitat is insufficient to support the species, which increases the loss of suitable habitat and reduces area of occupancy (David pers. comm. 2014). Additionally, the loss of riparian vegetation (potential spawning habitat) is likely to change the water temperature and reduces the terrestrial food supply.&#160;Other threats include&#160;artificial barriers to migration (which disrupt river connectivity and access to adult habitats, thereby negatively affecting the distribution of&#160;<em>Galaxias argenteus)</em><em>&#160;</em>and predation and competition by introduced salmonids, primarily brown trout <em>Salmo trutta</em>. Impacts on the population resulting from the harvest of whitebait are possible, but are currently un-quantified (McDowall 1990, Department of Conservation 2005, NIWA 2013).","This species&#160;is nationally assessed as 'At risk - declining' according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation's threat classification system (Goodman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). It&#160;has experienced significant population declines since European settlement times. The population has never recovered however the rate of decline appears to have slowed. The loss of around 85% to 90% of New Zealand's wetlands (Ministry for the Environment 1997) in the last 100 years has severely impacted on the population and distribution of this species. For example, historically this species was well known from south Canterbury streams and wetlands, but it is now absent from most of this region. This species remains in areas of suitable habitat and in areas where habitat is unimpaired. In areas where introduced predatory salmonids do not occur (e.g. Stewart Island), this species can be locally abundant.&#160;However, inland populations predominantly consist of adults with low apparent recruitment, which could be indicative of population declines in these areas. There are also likely to be localised declines as a result of loss of river connectivity. Additionally, despite occurrence of suitable habitat, this species is rare north of Auckland (probably due to unsuitable water temperatures). It is therefore inferred that there is still an overall slow, gradual decline in the population of <em>G. argenteus.&#160;</em>Although&#160;specific data on the rates of decline are unavailable, it is reasonable to assume on the basis of past, existing and continuing human pressures that the population has experienced at least a 25% decline over the past 20 years. Furthermore, a confounding aspect of this species' life history is that large, old fecund specimens could be sustaining the population in the face of habitat loss and drain clearing mortalities and a 10-20 year lag may be weakening the current observations of a decline (D. West pers. comm. 2014).",Decreasing,"The Giant Kokopu (<em>Galaxias argenteus</em>) is endemic to New Zealand where it occurs in areas of suitable habitats in the North and South Islands and Chatham and Stewart Islands, but not the sub-Antarctic islands or Kermadecs (McDowall, 1990). The extent of occurrence (EOO) is calculated as 9,654 km<sup><em>2</em>&#160;</sup>using an intersection of New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database records and spatial representations (polygons) of Freshwater Ecosystems of New Zealand 3rd-4th order river catchments and lakes (NZFFD 2011, FENZ 2010). The area of occupancy is as 348 km<em><sup>2</sup>,<sup>&#160;</sup></em>calculated&#160;from the sum of the lengths x estimated stream widths of river reaches in which this species was recorded the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD 2011;&#160;Ministry for the Environment 2013). This calculation includes lake areas where this species occurs, but it is unlikely to use the entire lake as habitat, so the AOO is an over estimation (West pers. comm. 2014).","Historical accounts indicate this species was a food source for Maori (Department of Conservation 2005). This&#160;species is currently harvested as a component of the domestic whitebait fishery, the proportion of which varies seasonally and geographically. Officially, there are no 'commercial' catches - superficially it is a recreational fishery, but there are no restrictions on then on-selling 'surplus' catch and no reporting of catches is required (G. Closs pers. comm. 2014). Over the scale of decades, there has clearly been a decline in catches from the early twentieth century to the present day. It is apparent that the catches that were achieved (even if many of the reports are anecdotal and allowing for overestimates), were massive 100 years ago relative to what they are today. However, there is currently no known data being collected in a sufficiently rigorous way that could confidently allow the direction of trends on a more recent year from year basis to be stated (Closs pers. comm. 2014). Available information suggests that abundance of this species is unlikely to be controlled by juvenile recruitment under existing conditions of fishery-induced mortality (McDowall 1999).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"This species was included in New Zealand's Department of Conservation large galaxiid recovery plan 2003-2013 (Department of Conservation 2005), which outlined a number of options for recovery. This document is expected to be updated in the near future, as the period of the plan has now passed. Many Protected Areas within New Zealand consist of high-altitude uplands (outside of this species' range), meaning the waterways are unsuitable for this species. There are however, stronghold populations in Rakiura National Park, Stewart Island, which are secure. Recent conservation measurement techniques include 'within bank' habitat augmentation and assessment within agricultural drains, which is being carried out in the Waituna wetland complex and also by the Waikato regional council within urban streams and at a number of regularly 'cleaned' modified channel sites. Trial translocations of captive reared fish to areas within the species natural range have also occurred. Additionally, the whitebait season on the West Coast has been shortened in an effort to reduce the vulnerability of this species to the fishery.

It is thought to be naturally rare with a population of less than 10,000 mature adults. This is a slow growing species with low fecundity, and therefore is naturally susceptible to over-exploitation. Major threats are bycatch in deep set shark nets and hook and line fishing for deepwater groupers. There is no population information available and nothing is known about current trends. Due to small number of localities known, and the life history, suspected low population size, and threats from bycatch, <em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> is listed as Vulnerable under criteria D2 and C2a (ii).","This is a demersal, non-migratory marine species found in deep water between 150-200m depth. It lives in water temperatures from 17-20°C. It is presumably found in rocky slopes and caves. Fricke <em>et al</em>. (2000) observed two specimens of 120 and 140 cm length in a deep carbonate cave at a depth of 155 m (water temp. 17.8-20.1°C).  <em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> is presumed to be very slow growing and long lived, with very low fecundity (maximum of around 50 for congeneric species), similar to sharks. Females produce large, orange-sized eggs which hatch within the oviduct before the female gives birth to live young. The autopsy of the Sulawesi Coelacanth that was caught in May 2007 in Bunaken National Marine Park, showed that in fact the fish was pregnant. Scientists in Indonesia, France and Japan are currently conducting research to better understand the reproductive biology of this fish.<br/><br/>Though scientists have never observed coelacanths feeding in their natural habitat, analyses of stomach contents of captured specimens have shown that their diet includes cuttlefish, squid, and various small to medium-sized benthic fishes – including lantern fishes, cardinal fishes and deepwater snappers.<br/><br/>Coelacanths can weigh up to 100 kg, though an average size is closer 30 kg.They may live to an age of at least 22 years.<br/><br/>There are many unanswered questions about the ecology of <em>Latimeria manadoensis</em>.<br/><br/>A unique combination of morphological features suggest that the coelacanth lineage is close to the origin of the evolution of early terrestrial, four-legged animals (tetrapods) like amphibians. The most remarkable of these features is the presence of seven lobed fins, unique among the living fishes. The paired fins move in an alternating fashion which resembles a horse in a slow trot. Other interesting features include a small secondary ""epicaudal"" lobe on its tail, an oil-filled notochord instead of a backbone, an intercranial joint which is thought to allow them to widen their gape when capturing prey, and a unique electrosensory rostral organ that may be used to detect prey. While their morphological features lead many scientists to believe the coelacanth lineage was the direct link to tetrapods, recent molecular evidence suggests that lung fish might be more closely related to tetrapods (University of California Museum of Paleontology, website).","<em>Latimeria menadoensis</em> has a very low population size and its life history makes it a species with higher extinction risk due to slow growth and low fecundity. This is not a commercial species and has no food value, but is caught as bycatch by deep shark nets and by hook and line targeting deepwater snapper.<br/><br/>This species is an extremely sought after aquarium fish, although no specimen has ever been successfully kept alive for aquarium display.","The population status of this species is unknown. It is believed to be a naturally small population (suspected to be less than 10,000 mature adults) and rare. A population study has never been undertaken and the species is very rarely caught by fisherman. One experienced fisherman informed that during his life as a fisherman this species was caught no more than 30 times, or not more than one or two times per year (M. Erdmann pers. comm.). The growth of its population is likely to be very slow, similar to <em>Latimeria chalumnae</em>. The shark fishermen at Menado Tua Island generally catch 1-2 individuals of <em>L. menadoensis</em> once every 5-10 years as bycatch (Erdmann and Kasim Moosa, pers. comm.).

It is found to 1,000 m depth but spends the highest percentage of its time at shallower depths, and is not usually seen close to land masses or islands, unless there is a deep drop-off of the shelf. This species can dive as deep as 1,000 m, but it remains mostly within the upper 40 m. It is believed to form small-scale schools of at most 10 individuals. Larger fish tend to swim solitarily (Nakamura 1985) but smaller ones form aggregations.<br/><br/>It feeds on squids, tuna-like fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods (Nakamura 1985).

In the southern hemisphere, concentrations of spawning fish probably occur around French Polynesia (Howard and Ueyanagi 1965). In Brazil, spawning occurs February to March from 20–23°S, primarily in the Abrolhos Archipelago (Amorim <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). Most of the individuals captured at this location have been juveniles (Amorim pers. comm. 2010).<br/><br/>Maximum time at large recorded is 11 years (Ortiz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Maximum age is estimated to be at least 20 years (Wilson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Maximum age is estimated in the Pacific as 27 years (females) and 18 years (males) (Hill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1989). Age estimation in marlins is problematic and longevity information from the Pacific has also been applied to the Atlantic. Age at maturity is estimated to be two years (Prince <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, Torres-Silva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Using longevity estimates of 20 years and 27 years, and age of maturity of two years, the generation length was estimated to be between 4.5–6 years.

More than 73% of reported landings are incidental to large offshore longline fisheries, and other major fisheries are the directed recreational fisheries of the USA and other countries (Restrepo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003). Protections efforts for blue marlin have continued to decrease in recent years, as deeper longline gear is introduced (Uozumi 1999).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic new fleets have harvested large catches of Blue Marlin,  including artisanal fish aggregating devices (FAD) fisheries in the  eastern Caribbean islands and a new artisanal fleet of small longliners  operating off Brazil between 18°S and 30°S. This species is primarily  taken as bycatch by longline fisheries, but also by purse seines, by  some artisanal gears which are the only fisheries targeting marlins and  also by various sport fisheries located on both sides of the Atlantic. The increasing use of anchored FADs by various artisanal and sport  fisheries is causing greater vulnerability of these stocks (STECF 2009).  For example, over the last fifteen years, Antillean artisanal fleets  have increased the use of Moored Fish Aggregating Devices (MFADs) to  capture pelagic fish. Catches of Blue Marlin caught around MFADs are  known to be significant but reports on these catches made to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) are  very incomplete (ICCAT 2006).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The most recent stock assessment for Blue Marlin (ICCAT 2007) used a Bayesian Surplus Production model to estimate biomass from 1990 through 2006.

Population declines were examined using a generation length estimated between 4.5 and 6 years. Over a three generation length period of 14 years, the decline was 60% and over a three generation length period of 18 years, the decline was 64%. These declines were calculated using a linear regression over each of the time periods examined. Population reduction for Atlantic blue marlin was therefore estimated to be between 60% and 64%. For all of the models for which the stock productivity was constrained to be near the productivity estimated by the last full assessment, the current biomass was estimated to be at or below biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and current fishing mortality rates were above FMSY.

We therefore used estimated catch data from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) (Hinton, unpublished data 2011), which were the only available recent data. We assume that effort has remained stable or has increased over the time period examined. Based on catch data and a generation length of 4.5–6 years, we estimated declines of 5% over 14 years (1996–2009) and 19% over 18 years (1992–2009) using linear regression.

The CPUE decline for Japanese longliners in the Seychelles was 79.5% over 14 years and 56.9% over 18 years (Figure 40, IOTC 2009). For each time period considered, an average of the declines in Northwest Australia and the Seychelles was used to characterize the population in the Indian Ocean. The decline in the Indian Ocean ranged from 63–69% depending on the time period considered. It is important to note that these data are limited and catch data from other industrial fisheries such as longliners of Indonesia and Philippines are not available.

There is also a directed recreational catch for this species in many areas. The flesh is of good quality and is marketed frozen and prepared as  sashimi and but most of it is marketed frozen or for sausages in Japan  (Nakamura 1985).",Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed under Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In some areas, long-lining is restricted to protect fish stocks for sport fishing. Size limitations, encouragement of catch-and-release sport fishing, and recommendations for using circle hooks instead of J-hooks are measures designed to increase survival in catch-and-release sport fishing (Pine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Serafy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Marlin species are a special case because bycatch in the longline fisheries concentrating primarily on tunas causes the majority of fishery mortality (&gt;90%) for marlin (Kitchell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). In the Pacific, marlin are most frequently captured on the shallow hooks of a longline set (those close to the floats), and removing less than 15% of the hook sets adjacent to floats would decrease marlin catch by as much as 50% (Kitchell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).<br/><br/>For Blue Marlin in the Atlantic, the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT–SCRS) in 2008 asked the Commission, at a minimum, to continue the management measures already in place because marlins have not yet recovered. The Commission should take steps to assure that the reliability of the recent fishery information improves in order to provide a basis for verifying possible future rebuilding of the stocks. Improvements are needed in the monitoring of the fate and number of dead and live releases, with verification from scientific observer programs; verification of current and historical landings from some artisanal and industrial fleets; and complete and updated relative abundance indices from CPUE data for the major fleets. Should the Commission wish to increase the likelihood of success of the current management measures of the marlin rebuilding plan, further reduction in mortality would be needed, including: implementing plans to improve compliance of current regulations; encouraging the use of alternative gear configurations, including certain types of circle hooks, hook/bait combinations etc., in fisheries where its use has been shown to be beneficial; and broader application of time/area catch restrictions.<br/><br/>Given the recent importance of the catch from artisanal fisheries, and to increase the likelihood of recovery of marlin stocks, the Commission should consider regulations that control or reduce the fishing mortality generated by these fisheries. The Commission should encourage continued research on development of methods to incorporate this information into stock assessments in order to provide a basis for increasing the certainty with which management advice can be provided.<br/><br/>The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) stresses the need for correct identification and reporting of billfish species in all&#160; fisheries. Furthermore, STECF notes that the 2007 ICCAT–SCRS report indicated the potential for the stocks of blue marlin and white marlin to recover to the BMSY level. However, recent increases in catches of Blue Marlin by artisanal fisheries on both sides of the Atlantic may compromise the effectiveness of the ICCAT plan (STECF 2009).<br/><br/>Recent analyses suggest that the recovery of blue marlin stock might proceed faster than would have been estimated at the 2000 assessment, provided catches remain at the level estimated for 2004. Some signs of stabilization in the abundance trend are apparent in the most recent catch per unit of effort data of Blue Marlin (2000–2004) Recommendations [Rec. 00-13], [Rec. 01-10] and finally [Rec. 02-13] placed additional catch restrictions for Blue Marlin and White Marlin. The first established that the annual amount of Blue Marlin that can be harvested by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels and retained for landing must be no more than 33% for White Marlin and 50% for Blue Marlin of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is greater. That recommendation established that all Blue Marlin and White Marlin brought to pelagic longline and purse seine vessels alive shall be released in a manner that maximizes their survival. The provision of this paragraph does not apply to marlins that are dead when brought along the side of the vessel and that are not sold or entered into commerce. Catches of both species have declined since 1996–99, the period selected as the reference period by the recommendations. Since 2002, the year of implementation of the last of these two recommendations, the catch of Blue Marlin has been below the 50% value recommended by the Commission. This analysis represents only longline caught marlin even though the recommendations referred to the combined catch of pelagic longline and purse seine because the catch estimates of billfish by-catch from purse seine vessels are more uncertain than those from longline. More countries have started reporting data on live releases in 2006. Additionally, more information has come about, for some fleets, on the potential for using gear modifications to reduce the bycatch and increase the survival of marlins (ICCAT 2007).<br/><br/>Catches of Blue Marlin in the Indian Ocean are very poorly reported and there is need of better data to evaluate the condition of the Indian Ocean stock.","",,false,false,Global

Using a generation length of between 4.5 and 6.5 years, the estimated decline in overall stock abundance is 9–37% over a period of 13 and 20 years, respectively. The most recent stock assessment shows a slight stabilization or increase in abundance in recent years, however, more data are needed to confirm whether this is accurate. Considering that this species is well below the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and is not considered to be well managed, it is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2.","This is a pelagic, oceanodromous species that usually occurs above the thermocline. Its distribution varies seasonally, reaching higher latitudes in both the north and south hemispheres only during the respective warm seasons. It is usually found in pelagic habitat in waters over 50 m depth with surface temperatures over 22°C and salinities of 35–37 ppt.<br/><br/>It migrates into subtropical waters to spawn, with peak spawning occurring in early summer. The spawning areas are found in deep and blue oceanic waters, generally at high temperatures ranging from 20–29°C except in the south Atlantic gyrals, and high surface salinities (over 35 ppt).<br/><br/>Lucena-Fredóu and Asano-Filho (2006) found individuals ranging from 153–290 cm (upper jaw fork length (FL) in the Brazilian northern coast. The 290 cm animal is the largest recorded to date, with a weight of 120 kg. Nóbrega <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2009) caught individuals from 105–207 cm of fork length (FL) on Brazilian northeast.<br/><br/>Longevity is estimated at 15 years (Ortiz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Hazin (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. in prep) studying individuals from Brazilian northeast, found a size at first sexual maturity (at L50) of 138.5 cm of&#160; low jaw fork length (LJFL) for males and 145 cm for females, and a higher mean of gonad index in May and June for both genders. The age of maturity was estimated to be 2.5–4 years of age (Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). There is no apparent sexual dimorphism but females attain larger sizes than males.<br/><br/>Given an observed longevity of 15 years and a length of maturity (L50) of approximately 145–160 cm, we infer an age of 50% maturity of 2.5–4 years (both sexes) and a generation length of&#160; 4.5–6.5 years (Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><br/>White Marlin are known to frequently kill or stun their food by spearing it or hitting it with their bill (Nakamura 1985). Squids are an important part of their diet but they also feed on crustaceans and a wide variety of fishes such as dolphinfish, jacks, and flyingfishes (Nakamura 1985, Vaske <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).<br/><br/>The all-tackle game fish record is of a 82.5 kg fish caught off Vitoria, Brazil in 1979 (IGFA 2011).","This species is primarily taken by longline fisheries (including various EU longline fisheries), but also by purse seines (including EU purse seiners catching a few hundreds tonnes yearly), by some artisanal gears which are the only fisheries targeting marlins (Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, including EU ones in the Antilles) and also by various sport fisheries located in both sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Over 90% of the reported landings are attributed to bycatch in longline fisheries and there are also important directed recreational fisheries (Restrepo et al. 2003). Despite voluntary conservation measures, mandated minimum size limits, and wide acceptance of catch-and-release, white marlin are currently considered to be severely overfished (Restrepo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Jesien <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). The most recent assessment (ICCAT 2007) states that the biomass for 2000–2004 most likely remained well below the BMSY estimate in the 2002 assessment (ICCAT 2007). The observed distribution of several large pelagic predators, including the white marlin, has significantly contracted from the 1960s to 2000 (Worm and Tittensor 2011). A petition to declare white marlin an endangered species in the USA was not accepted (White Marlin Review Team 2002).<br/><br/>The increasing use of anchored fish aggregating devices (FADs) by various artisanal and sport fisheries is increasing the vulnerability of these stocks (STECF 2009).","This species is occasionally caught in the Mediterranean Sea with no known population information. It is unclear whether there are two separate stocks or a single population in the Atlantic (Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). The most recent ICCAT stock assessment considers a single stock in the Atlantic (ICCAT 2007).<br/><br/>Catch for the Atlantic: recorded since 1956 when total catch was minimal; peaked in 1965 at nearly 5,000 t, then oscillated between 1,000 and 1,500 t until 1993; increased to 1,900 t in 1994; declined below 1,000 t from 1995–2004 (ICCAT 2007). During the 2006 marlin assessment it was noted that catches of Blue Marlin and White Marlin continued to decline through 2004. The estimate for 2005 was 597 t. The recent biomass most likely remains well below BMSY estimated in the 2002 assessment. Over the period 2001–2004 combined longline indices and some individual fleet indices suggest that the decline has been at least partially reversed, but some other individual fleet indices suggest that abundance has continued to decline. Confirmation of these recent apparent changes in trend will require at least an additional four or five years of data, especially since the reliability of the recent information has diminished and may continue to do so.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the decrease in catches is associated with ICCAT regulations that were put in place in 2001 regarding the mandatory release of live white marlin taken by pelagic longlines. In addition in 2003, there was the imposition of catch limits to 33% of the 1996 or 1999 reported values. Countries are now reporting their landings, not their total catch.<br/><br/>The most recent stock assessment (ICCAT 2007) used a Bayesian Surplus Production model to estimate biomass from 1990 through 2006. The remaining data series (1956–1989) are based on biomass estimates from the previous stock assessment (ICCAT 2003). Population declines were examined using a generation length estimated between 4.5 and 6.5 years. Over a three generation length period of 13 years, the decline was 8.67% and over a three generation length period of 20 years, the decline was 36.74%. These declines were calculated using the biomass estimate of the first to the last year of the range examined. Population reduction for Atlantic White Marlin was therefore estimated to be between 9% and 37%.<br/><br/>In addition, there is still a high degree of uncertainty regarding biological parameters for this species. Landings of White Marlin may also be misidentified with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tetrapturus georgii</span>. The proportion of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. georgii</span> has increased dramatically in catches from 2–32 % in the past decade, which increases the uncertainty of the status of White Marlin (Beerkircher <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).",Decreasing,"Found throughout warm waters of the Atlantic from 45°N to 45°S including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Mediterranean&#160; (Nóbrega <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Records from the Mediterranean Sea and from Bretagne, France seem to be based on a few straying individuals.<br/><br/>Its distribution shows some seasonal variation, being most found in the highest latitudes only during warmer periods of the year (Ferreira and Hazin 2004). It is normally found in waters where the surface temperature is above 22°C, in waters over 300 m in depth and within a salinity range from 35–37% (Ferreira and Hazin 2004).<br/><br/>Previous reports have mentioned spawning of White Marlin off southeast Brazil in the same area where Blue Marlin spawn, but later in the year from April to June. Off southern Brazil (25–26ºS and 40–45ºW) White Marlin spawn from December to March. In the northwest Atlantic, White Marlin have been reported to spawn in the Gulf of Mexico in June. Recent reports confirm that White Marlin also spawns offshore and north of the Antilles (19–23ºN and 60–70ºW) between April and July.","This is a species with minor commercial importance.

It has been subject to an intense, recorded recreational fishery between 1982 and 2005, during which there has been substantial declines in catch and the estimated spawning biomass. In a comprehensive assessment of the Tautog fishery of the north-eastern American states (ASMFC Fisheries Focus 2006), fisheries investigations suggest that overfishing is occurring on a coastwide basis. Fisheries data from 1984 to 2003 indicated a decrease in population of 50-73% in the southern portion of its range,  although declines in the northern (Canadian) portion of its range are not known. Therefore, the overall population is estimated to have declined of at least 40% over three generation lengths (45 years) reaching the threshold for Vulnerable under Criterion A. For most such larger coastal species living near high population centres, the improvements in fish-finding and navigational electronics means the catch rates are going to increase, and therefore the declines may also continue. The catches are very high compared to the similar sized Australian wrasses of the genus <em>Achoerodus</em>, and the CPUE seems to be declining. Very little information is available on the reproductive behaviour of this species and there is a shortage of demographic information from the species northern range. More reseach on this species' ecology and harvest is recommended.","This species has many of the same biological features as the <em>Achoerodus</em> species. It is fairly long-lived in the south and there is a possibility that nothern populations are even longer lived still but there is no available demographic data from northern populations (J.H. Choat pers comm. 2008).<br/><br/>There is little field based biological information available especially concerning spawning and reproductive behavior despite the amount of effort put into the catch and fishery statistics of this species (J.H. Choat pers comm. 2008).<br/><br/>This species inhabits shallow water in the summer but migrates to deeper water (25-40 m) when temperatures fall below 10°C. Adults are usually associated with reefs and manmade structures (Arendt <em>et al.</em> 2001).  Adult males are territorial and active during the day to feed and rest in crevices at night.  Newly settled individuals and small juveniles occur in estuaries (Dorf and Powell 1997). Juveniles are found in seagrass or algal beds (Bigelow and Schroeder 2001). This species undergoes seasonal migrations (Olla <em>et al.</em> 1974)<br/><br/>Maximum size is 94 cm (TL) and 11.4 kg. Maximum age is 34 years, age at female maturity is 3-4 yrs and size 14-25 cm (White <em>et al.</em> 2003). This species is slow growing (Hottstetter and Munroe 1993). More recent work suggests that growth rates maybe higher in the far southern end of the range but that work has yet to be peer reviewed ASMFC (2006). Few age estimates from the northern range of this species. <br/><br/>Species is a gonochoristic (Cooper <em>et al.</em> 1997, LaPlant and Schultz 2007), serial spawner, with up to 58 spawnings per season (White 1996), peak spawning is from May to June. Spawning was noted in June-July in Canadian waters, but appears more protracted (April-July) in coastal waters of Virginia, USA. It feeds mainly on mussels, gastropods, other molluscs and crustaceans. This species has gained popularity as a prized food and sport fish (Leim and Scott 1966, Hostetter 1993, Arendt <em>et al.</em> 2001). Investigation on the diel and seasonal activity patterns of the adult tautog in its southern range were conducted using ultrasonic telemetry (Arendt <em>et al.</em> 2001). It spawns in groups or in pairs. Pairing occurs between females and size-dominant males exhibiting strong territoriality and performing a protracted courtship (Hostetter and Munroe 1993). There is no histological evidence yet to prove or disprove the occurrence of hermaphroditism in this species.","The Tautog has been subject to an intensive fishery over the last two decades (ASMFC Fishery Focus 2006) of which recreational fishing accounts for 90% of recorded landings. Over this time recreational landings in the Atlantic United States have declined from a peak of 4,201,575 kg in 1988 to 1,698,750 kg in 2004, a reduction of 60% in recorded landings (ASMFC Fishery Focus 2006), with effort assumed to be at least constant. Declines in the northern (Canadian) portion of its range are not known. <br/><br/>Despite the development of a live fish trade element, the commercial fishery returns have remained stable and increases in fishing mortality are attributable to the recreational fishery. An intensive stock assessment (ASMFC 2006) confirmed that fishing mortality driven by recreational fisheries was above recommended levels. <br/><br/>A modeling exercise in the stock assessment program indicated a decline in the estimated spawning biomass from 39,916,128 kg in 1986 to 10,886,217 kg in 2004, a 73% reduction (ASMFC Fishery Focus 2006). The main conclusion of the ASMFC reports was that overfishing was occurring and that demography and habitat selection makes this species particularly susceptible to over fishing. Present management initiatives seek to reduce fishing pressure through bag and size limits and seasonal closures.","A very good set of catch and fishery statistics is available for this species, but most of the data are fishery dependent. Peak abundance from fisheries estimate 40,000,000 individuals in 1982 and 20,000,000 in 2003 (ASMFC 2006). Therefore, over the past 24-30 years there has been a decline of 50% of the estimated population.",Decreasing,"This species is found from South Carolina, USA to Nova scotia, Canada.

It is a large species that is found in highly accessible coastal habitat, and is the longest lived wrasse species. It is impacted by commercial and recreational fishing throughout its range. There have been declines of 60-90% over the past 20 years (since at least the 1990s) in at least a third of its range in the western part of its distribution, and assumed decline throughout its range due to fishing based on current low abundance in almost all of its range. Therefore, the overall population decline for this species is estimated to be at least 30% over the past 30 years, and will likely increase with continued commercial fishing.&#160; Although data on this species population and fishing effort is not available over the full three generation lengths (75 years), it is conservatively assumed that this species has been fished over the past 75 years, and the population trend before the 1980s was either stable or also in decline. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable. However, if older population or fishing data becomes available, this species may warrant reassessment as it may qualify for a higher threat category.","This is largest and longest-lived wrasse recorded, achieving a length of 170 cm and 70 years of age. The species is probably a protogynous hermaphrodite based on age and size distribution with a highly asymptotic growth pattern in both sexes and with males achieving a larger size than females. Spawning occurs in winter (June to October peaking in August). Recruitment to the reef habitat is highly episodic. Female maturity is late at 17 years, and occurs at a large size 653 mm TL with sex change at 35 years  and at 830 mm TL. Based on a longevity of 70 years and first maturity of 17 years, average generation length is estimated to be 25 years. As this species does not typically change sex until a relatively old age (35-39 years), the abundance of the males of this protogynous hermaphrodite would be especially at risk of becoming depleted through fishing (Coulson <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>This species recruits onto more vegetated sheltered parts of reefs, and once they mature they move out onto deeper exposed coasts. Recruitment occurs on inshore reefs  and larger individuals occur offshore on deeper reefs. <br/><br/>Natural mortality is 0.054/year (0.021-0.090/year), and fishing mortality 0.039/year (0.003-0.073/year) (Coulson <em>et al.</em> 2009).","This species is subject to both recreational and commercial fishing including bylines, spearing and commercial gill netting. The commercial fishery is dominated by gill netting which targets individuals between 428-1,162 mm and six to 70 years of age (Coulson <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Western Australia  in 2002 the recreational fishery for wrasse species caught 192,000 individual fish (Henry and Lyle 2003)  which have a smaller mean size than those taken in the commercial fishery. The blue groper component can account for 90% of the catch (DeLacy 2008). Direct observation and CPUE data (DeLacy 2008) and estimates of yield per recruit and fishing mortality (Coulson <em>et al.</em> 2009) demonstrate that this species is overfished in Western Australian waters. <br/><br/>In eastern Australia, this species has suffered such heavy fishing mortality in the 1980s, that the waters of that region were closed to commercial and recreational fishing for that species and still remain closed to spear and commercial fishing (Gillanders 1999).<br/><br/>However, monitoring of this species populations by fishery independent methods is sporadic. The rapid increase in the use of improved technology (e.g. echo sounders, GPS) for coastal fishing since 1990 shows the major impact of these instruments on fishing effort.","Although the geographic range extends over 1,500 km along the Australian coastline, this species achieves relatively high abundances (seven individuals per 125 m<sup>2</sup>) at only one section of it geographical range around Esperance. In the northwestern part of its range, its abundance has declined since the 1990s between 60% (near Albany) and 93% (near Capes which is 635 km to the west of Esperance) based on recorded landings from commercial gillnet fisheries. Abundance in this western part of its range has correspondingly declined to about  ~0.2 individuals per 125 m<sup>2</sup> (DeLacy 2008). <br/><br/>This species has experienced declines of 60-90% over the past 20 years (since at least the 1990s) in at least a third of its range in the western part of its distribution, and due to fishing throughout its relatively restricted range, is considered to be in very low abundances and declining in almost all of its range. The overall population decline for this species is therefore conservatively estimated to be at least 30% over the past 30 years (J.H Choat pers. comm. 2008), and may likely increase with continued commercial fishing in some parts of its range. It is conservatively assumed that the population trend before this time was either stable or also in decline from fishing, and the population was in the same if not in greater abundance.",Decreasing,"This species is a large long-lived wrasse that is endemic to the southwestern and southern coasts of Australia. <br/><br/>Its geographic range extends from the Geraldton on the central western Australian coast to Bass Strait in the east.

12464899,61340,Semicossyphus pulcher,Vulnerable,A2bd,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Recent (last decade) increases in the level of exploitation, especially for the lucrative live fish trade, the catch of juveniles or small females, the life-history of the animal (i.e., large, long-lived, relatively slow to reach sexual maturation and sex-changing), and a limited geographic range are all factors that indicate that this species should be carefully monitored in the near future. This species was intensively fished in the past (at levels nearly as high as those in the late 1990s) in the 1920s but interest waned after a decade or so, which may have allowed stocks time to recover. Fishing pressure increased in the last decade.
<br/>
<br/>Mainly juveniles are included in important commercial trap fishery, with juveniles and smaller adults dominating the hook and line and recreational fishery. Male numbers seem typically low which could result in sperm limitation for the species, with further male reduction, resulting in reduced reproductive output: males are readily targeted in the recreational spear fishery.
<br/>
<br/>Commercial and recreational fishing pressure has increased (there is also an artisanal sector) and catches have declined over the last decade. Given the growing popularity of the live fish trade and its appeal for high retail prices, pressure may well grow in this commercial sector in particular, especially if prices increase as the species becomes less readily available.
<br/>
<br/>Although variability in catches could be due to natural recruitment variation and also to changes in fishing effort; indications are that effort is likely to be increasing for commercial use and data from logbooks suggest that Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) has declined approximately 3-fold since the 1980s (Fig. 4.4.d in Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). Recent declines in landings could be, at least in part, the consequence of management introduced in 2002. The effect of environmental conditions on recruitment is not known.
<br/>
<br/>The natural history of this species, including its limited geographic range along inshore habitat, the likely increasing interest in the fishery and the currently unsustainable fishing levels (according to the models of Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004), together with the difficulties in enforcing existing regulations strongly suggest that this species will continue to decline if stronger protective action is not put into place.
<br/>
<br/>In terms of the IUCN Red List Criteria, the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are small enough to qualify this species as Endangered except that additional conditions related to these areas being in decline, population being severely fragmented or suffering extreme fluctuations are not met. However, the population has declined, judging primarily by a three-fold decline in CPUE. This could qualify <em>S. pulcher</em> as Endangered under reductions in population size &gt;50% over the last three generations where the reduction and its causes have not ceased, and based on an index appropriate to the taxon (EN A2b). However, as such a large decline is not supported by landings data, and as increasingly stringent management has been enacted since 1999, <em>S. pulcher</em> is listed for now as Vulnerable based on a lesser reduction in population size of &gt;30% (VU A2bd).","Inhabits rocky reefs, especially where there are kelp beds. It occurs from 0–55 m depth (Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983) although around Cabo San Lucas (southern tip of Baja California) it occurs only in deeper water, 60–100 m (Cowen 1985). The fish tend to stay in the same reef and do not move around a lot, as shown by tag-recapture research (DeMartini <em>et al</em>. 1994). <br/> <br/>Maximum age is at least 50 years (Fitch and Lavenberg 1971); such old individuals are likely to be very rare, however. The oldest fish of 276 collected from 4 unexploited populations throughout the range of the California sheephead was 21 years (Cowen 1990). Furthermore, the oldest individual of 470 fish taken off California and Mexico in the early 1970s was 20 years (Warner 1975). <br/> <br/>Growth parameters vary among populations and studies (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). The value of k ranged from 0.007 to 0.068, while estimated Lsub&gt;inf ranged from 45.46 to 464.16 (cm fork length). The k = 0.068 and L<sub>inf</sub> = 83.86 cm (maximum length) were the best fit to the observed size and age data (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/> <br/>The age of sexual maturity and age of sex changeover (from female to male) shows great variation depending on location (Cowen 1990). For instance, at Santa Nicholas Island off California, the species becomes sexually mature (as females) at 5–6 years. Males did not predominate until ages 13–14. At the offshore Guadalupe Island, sexual maturity took place at 3–4 years with sexual transformation to males taking place at 5–6 years. Other locations in Mexico to the south of Guadalupe Island have populations that show ages of sexual maturity and changeover intermediate to the 2 aforementioned islands (Cowen 1990). Size of first sexual maturation varied from 12–18 cm SL in females and 18–28 cm SL in males, depending on location (Cowen 1990). <br/> <br/>Size of 50% sexual maturation is approximately 20–30 cm, and sex change occurs roughly between 25 and 35 cm (Warner 1975, Cowen 1990). <br/> <br/>In the area of Catalina Island, California, the Sheephead wrasse spawns from August to October, while sex change occurs during the winter months (Warner 1975, Cowen 1990). Individuals may spawn more than once a season. It has been estimated that females spawn approximately 86 times per year (about once every 1.3 days), batch fecundity of females is 5,755 eggs per spawning event, and there is no significant relationship between the number of eggs released per kilogram of body weight and total female body weight (average 15,000 eggs per kg) (DeMartini <em>et al</em>. 1994). <br/> <br/>Generation time was calculated from samples of 4 relatively unexploited populations taken throughout the main area of distribution off California and Baja California (Cowen 1985). This species is protogynous, changing sex from female to male. Observed adult sex ratios in California Sheephead vary from 3:1 mature females to males to 0.8:1 (Cowen 1990). In unexploited populations, it seems likely that the females are limiting, although in exploited populations where males (as the larger animals) are targeted, males may ultimately become the limiting sex. The generation time for each location was calculated using the length frequency data for the females of the 4 populations (Figure 4 in Cowen 1990) and converting this to age frequency using the length-age relationship data (Figure 2 in Cowen 1990). Generation time, as the mean age of mature females varied from 4.1 to 8.5 years across the 4 populations, these are therefore set as the plausible limits of generation time. The mean of the 4 generation times calculated, 6.8, is assumed to be representative of the entire population and was, therefore, used as the point estimate. <br/> <br/>The species is a generalist carnivore (Cowen 1983), feeding on mussels and red sea-urchins and may play an important role in regulating prey density (see citations in Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/> <br/>Natural mortality is likely to be in the order of M=0.2 (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/> <br/><strong>Data needed:</strong> <br/>How effectively protected is this species in designated marine reserves since MPAs are probably an important management measure for this species? <br/> <br/>It would be very useful to have recent fisheries independent data on California Sheephead stocks. At present, landings would have to decrease over a number of years with a constant or increasing fishing effort in order to recognise falling stocks. The obvious way to achieve fisheries independent data and quickly assess the state of fish stocks would be to repeat the underwater visual census work of Cowen (1985, 1990) and compare the data with his pre-intensive exploitation figures. In the meantime, changes in CPUE are likely to offer the best indications of changes in abundance. <br/> <br/>There seems to have been little work on the ecology of this species. It would be important to know if populations of Sheephead were affected by changes in environment, or habitat, such as changes in the extent and quality of kelp beds. <br/> <br/>Data from Mexico on landings and CPUE from 1976 onwards are needed.","The fishery for this species, which began in at least the late 1800s (for salted fish), peaked in 1928 with landings of 370,000 pounds. This may have been as the species was easily available close to port, and the species has maintained a presence in the California nearshore fishery (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). From the 1940s to 1980s there was little interest in the Sheephead and catches were usually under 10,000 pounds. Fish are taken by trap, set net, speargun and hook and line (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/> <br/>The fishery greatly increased from the late 1980s to the present. At least some of the new demand is for small and live fish, usually pre-reproductive females kept live in tanks in Asian seafood restaurants, prior to being eaten (Stephens 1992). While the Sheephead population was considered stable up until the early 1990s, the targetting of these juvenile animals gives some cause for concern (Stephens 1992) as some fish, mostly females, are being taken before they have had a chance to reproduce. Such fish will be up to 12–18 cm SL, depending on where they were caught (see size of sexual maturity in Cowen 1990), and are desired as they are small enough for the restaurant tanks. The live fish fishery resulted in considerably increased landing, reaching a peak of 166,364 kgs in 1997. During this time period, the prices (adjusted for the effects of inflation) increased from 0.10US$/lb in the 1940s to over $9.00/lb in the 1990s for live fish (Stephens 2001). <br/> <br/>Recreational fish landings were higher than commercial landings in the 1980s and in 2002, the Sheephead was 13th in the recreational fishery in southern California. Large and old individuals are vulnerable to depletion by spearing since they are readily speared (CDFG 2003). <br/> <br/>As an example of growth of the high value live fish (trap and hook and line) fishery for this species, between 1989 and 1992, increased from 2–27 boats landing over 23,636 kgs of live fish (Palmer-Zwahlen <em>et al</em>. 1993 cited in Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Sheephead accounted for more than 88% of live fish landing in the developing live-fish fishery. <br/> <br/>Recruitment in southern regions of the California Sheephead geographic range appears to be primarily from northern regions as this is the primary direction of current flow (Cowen 1985). If fishing were to reduce the numbers of breeding adults in the north (i.e., the US), this could result in decreased recruitment, and therefore numbers of mature adults, in the south (i.e., Mexico).","The recreational catch for 1999 was estimated at 77,226 fish with an estimated mean weight of 2.36 pounds (personal communication from the database of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Fisheries Statistics and Economics Division, Silver Spring, MD, 2001). If it is assumed that the average weight of commercially caught fish is the same, then 54,190 (129/767 pounds / 2.36) fish were caught in 1999 giving a total of 132,136 fish caught in commercial and recreational fisheries in 1999. Since 1999 both commercial and recreational catches have fluctuated although by 2003 the combined (total) catch had declined by 20%.
<br/>
<br/>The maximum number of fishes in the population was calculated by the highest density of this species recorded for a site by underwater visual census (from Cowen 1985), multiplied by the area of occupancy. This seems reasonable as (1) densities were observed in the early 1980s prior to the recent increase in exploitation and (2) California Sheephead are reportedly rare outside the area of occupancy (see Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy Notes above).
<br/>
<br/>The highest density recorded was 8.5 mature individuals (calculated from Table 2 in Cowen 1990) per 250 sq. m. The upper estimate for the area of occupancy is 2,070 sq.km. This gives an upper population size of 70,380,000.
<br/>
<br/>Landings data from Mexico appear to have become severely reduced between 1950 and 1976 – no further data are available. No CPUE data are available so it is not known whether effort changed over this time period.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Reduction Notes:</strong>

<br/>
<br/>Note that the above are landings data – there are no indications of fishing effort.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Population Reduction:</strong>
<br/>Although variability in catches could be due to natural recruitment variation and also to changes in fishing effort; indications are that effort is likely to be increasing for commercial use and data from logbooks suggest that CPUE has declined approximately 3-fold since the 1980s (Figure 4.4.d in Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). Exploitation rate is estimated to have increased in recent history regardless of the estimate of natural mortality used (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Given that there is a fishery catching approximately 100,000 individuals of a large reef fish species that occupies a small geographic range, it seems very unlikely that the Sheephead population is expanding. At one extreme then, the population is assumed not to have changed in size (0% reduction). At the other extreme, it seems unlikely the population could have declined more than 50% overall without a marked decrease in landings in the US, something which is not apparent. The value of 50% is intuitive and is intended as an outside estimate.",Decreasing,"Occurs in the eastern Pacific. Ranges from Point Conception in California, to Guadalupe Island (off northern central Baja California) and the Gulf of California, Mexico. However, the species is rare south of Punta Abreojos, apart from a small population at Isla Santa Margarita, near Bahia Magdalena (Cowen 1985). Water current anomalies may occasionally result in larvae of this species recruiting to reefs as far north as Monterey Bay (Cowen 1985).
<br/>
<br/>Sheephead are found from Monterey Bay to the Gulf of California (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004) but are uncommon north of Point Conception and are much less common in the Gulf of California than along the Pacific Coast (Miller and Lea 1972). In the Channel Islands, densities of 1,475–1,525 individuals of all sizes per hectare have been observed (Davis and Anderson 1989) while another survey, which covered much of the geographic range of the species (Point Conception to Isla Santa Margarita) (Cowen 1985) reported density range between 16–290 adult fish per hectare.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy Notes</strong>:
<br/>Although this species is found from Point Conception (north of Santa Barbara) to Baja California and the Gulf of California, it is rare from Punta Abreojos south with the exception of Isla Santa Margarita (Cowen 1985). Suitable rocky reef area is assumed to extend 1 km offshore from land. The extent of occurrence is assumed to be the rocky reef area from Point Conception to Mazatlan at the mouth of the Gulf of California, and was calculated as 4,770–5,800 km² (5,300 +/- 10% to allow for inaccuracies in the calculations).
<br/>
<br/>The area of occupancy is assumed to be the rocky reef area from Point Conception to Punta Abreojos (including Isla Santa Margarita) and was calculated as 1,692–2,070 km² (1,880 km²  +/- 10% to allow for inaccuracies in the calculations).
<br/>
<br/>Decline in extent of occurrence or area of occupancy has not been reported for the species. The California Sheephead inhabits rocky reefs, which are assumed not to fluctuate in size or quality, or be in decline. There is also no evidence of any habitat bottlenecks that could increase the vulnerability of this species although there is a suggestion that kelp beds could be important to part of their life history (Stephens 1992).",,Marine,"Of the 19 nearshore species managed under the Nearshore Fishery Management Plan (NFMP), 16 (13 species of nearshore rockfish, California Scorpionfish, Cabezon, and Kelp Greenling) are designated as groundfish and fall under the management authority by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC). California Sheephead, Monkeyface Prickleback, and Rock Greenling do not have ‘groundfish’ designation, and thus are not managed by the PFMC (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004). This lack of PFMC management led to State of California regulations for California Sheephead and few other species (CDFG 2002). Regulations for California Sheephead tend to fall under the general nearshore fishery regulations. The commercial fishery for both trap and hook and line gear is a restricted access fishery. Permits for the live-fish trap fishery began in 1996 in southern California and a statewide Nearshore Fishery Permit began in 1999. These permits are limited to individuals who have participated in the fishery the previous year as well as meeting historical catch criteria.
<br/>
<br/>The Sheephead trap and hook and line fisheries reached optimal yield (OY) levels and closed early for all years beginning in 2001. According to the NFMP, ""Optimum Yield"" (OY) is defined in FGC section 97 (see Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004. p. 3) as the amount of fish taken in a fishery that does all of the following: (a) provides the greatest overall benefit to the people of California, particularly with respect to food production and recreational opportunities, and takes into account the protection of marine ecosystems, and (b) is the MSY of the fishery, reduced by relevant economic, social, or ecological factors, and (c) in the case of an overfished fishery, provides for rebuilding to a level consistent with producing MSY in the fishery (CDFG 2002). The 2002 OY was set to half that of total recent catches, and allocated almost 22,727 kgs more to the recreational fishery than the commercial fishery (Alonzo <em>et al</em>. 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Size restrictions on Sheephead were fairly minimal before 1999 for both the recreational and commercial fisheries. In 1999, CDFG set the minimum catch size for the commercial fishery to 12 inches (total length) and followed with the same size limit for the recreational fishery in 2001. To further decrease commercial harvest, the minimum commercial harvest size was increased to 13 inches in 2001. Also in 2001, the 10 fish recreational bag limit was reduced to five (CDFG 2002).
<br/>
<br/>In 2002, the Sheephead fishery was aligned with the nearshore rockfish fishery for both the commercial and recreational fisheries (CDFG 2002). Sheephead are not to be taken commercially north of Point Conception, Santa Barbara County during March and April, and south of Point Conception during January and February. This essentially represents a seasonal closure because the bulk of landings occur south of Point Conception (CDFG 2002). Other season and area closures affecting the Sheephead fishery result from management of the nearshore fishery. In 2001, taking Sheephead deeper than 20 fathoms in a Cowcod Conservation Area was banned.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Historically the two species were harvested commercially for flesh and caviar, but no species differentiation was recorded in the landings data. <br/> <br/>Although some shortnose sturgeon may still be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are habitat related resulting from loss or degradation. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).   <br/> <br/>Shortnose Sturgeon stocks appear to be stable and even increasing in a few large rivers but remain seriously depressed in others, particularly southern populations. Previous Red Lists listed the species as Vulnerable. Since that earlier listing, a Recovery Plan has been developed and is being implemented and genetically distinct population segments have been identified. Although exploitation is no longer a serious concern, effects of habitat alteration and degradation and water quality (contaminant) concerns remain. Thus, the shortnose sturgeon should continue to receive a Vulnerable listing. This is based, in part, on an estimated population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations with some irreversible habitat losses and continued concern about impacts of pollutants and water-based development activities on population health. We also note extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals between rivers, from a few hundred or less in the Chesapeake Bay to perhaps 10,000 or more in the Hudson.","Shortnose sturgeon use of saltwater is generally amphidromous throughout most of the species' range, although far northern populations are anadromous (Kynard 1997). Spawning takes place in upper freshwater areas, while feeding (summering) and wintering occurs in both fresh and saline environments. This species typically spends its entire life history in the natal river and estuary and only rarely moves any great distance in near-coastal marine waters. There are no naturally land-locked populations of the species, but two rivers have populations that are segmented by dams.
<br/>
<br/>This species typically attains an adult size of 75–100 cm total length, though the maximum recorded size for a Canadian-caught female was 1.43 m and 23.6 kg (Dadswell <em>et al</em>. 1984).  Maximum ages determined for female and male shortnose sturgeon (again in Canada) were 67 and 32 years, respectively (Vladykov and Greeley 1963).  Prespawning migrations in northern populations are triggered by increasing water temperatures of 7–10°C, and during spawning, males are attracted to females by a female pheromone (Kynard and Horgan 2002a).  Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 7–15°C.  Spawning habitat is a substrate of rock or large gravel (usually rubble), and water depth during spawning is highly variable. Spawning suitability windows follow day length of 13.9–14.9 h, water temperature of 6.5–15°C, and river discharge that provides 30–120 cm/sec (mean 70 cm/sec) bottom velocity. All spawning windows must be open simultaneously for spawning to occur. Yearling shortnose sturgeon initiate the major dispersal that moves young fish to join older juveniles and adults in fresh or salt water foraging concentration areas. Yearling and older juveniles use the same summering and wintering habitats as adults (Kynard <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>In southern waters, shortnose males may mature in 2-3 years and females in 4-6 years. In northern portions of the range, maturation may not occur for 10-15 years (maximum). Spawning periodicity is poorly understood but in the northern part of the range, females are highly variable (2-9 years) and males spawn at 1-5 year intervals depending on fish age and foraging conditions. Some males in northern populations spawn annually.","Although some shortnose sturgeon may be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are blockage of up- and downstream migrations at dams, habitat loss or degradation due to dams and dam operations, river channel dredging, and pollution. Southern populations are particularly at risk due to water withdrawal from rivers and groundwaters and from eutrophication that directly degrades river water quality causing loss of habitat. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).","The estimate of the total current population size for the Hudson River indicates a 95% confidence interval of 26,000 to 55,000 individuals. The Saint John, Kennebec, and Delaware subpopulations appear to be on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 fish each. Estimates of other northern populations are the Connecticut River (CT-MA) — about 1,200 fish, and the Merrimack River (MA) of less than 100 individuals (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997, Savoy 2004). Though many rivers in the southern region have been documented to contain shortnose sturgeon, few have had population estimates conducted. Only abundance in the Ogeechee and Altamaha rivers of Georgia have been estimated and both appear to be on the order of 1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Shortnose sturgeon occur only rarely in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and no breeding population has been confirmed here.
<br/>
<br/>Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2001) analyzed shortnose sturgeon populations from two drainages in Maine and the Hudson River for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences between the Kennebec and Androscoggin stocks and even greater separation when compared to the Hudson stock. These data support the putative stock structure and distinct population segment designation adopted for shortnose sturgeon.",Decreasing,"Shortnose sturgeons occur in many of the large coastal rivers of eastern North America. From survey and tagging data, the National Marine Fisheries Service now recognizes 19 distinct population segments. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery Team considered sturgeon populations from two general regions, northern rivers and southern rivers. The largest populations in the northern region appear to be in the Saint John, NB, Canada (Dadswell 1979), Delaware, NJ-PA (Hastings <em>et al</em>. 1987), Kennebec, ME (Squiers <em>et al</em>. 1982), and Hudson, NY rivers (Bain <em>et al</em>. 1995).  <br/> <br/>See the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.natureserve.org/explorer/%E2%80%9C"">NatureServe Explorer</a> database for a more detailed description of this species’ range.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The shortnose sturgeon was listed as endangered under the inaugural U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1967.

While there is little information on changes in numbers of the species, there is indirect evidence to suggest that declines have taken place and are continuing. This listing is consistent with the precautionary approach of the IUCN Red List.&#160;<br/> <br/><em>Hippocampus kuda </em>is a valuable species in trades for traditional medicine, curios and aquaria (Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010). The demand for this species is high due to its large size, smooth texture, and pale complexion when dried, all desirable qualities for traditional medicine purposes (Vincent 1996). This species is also incidentally caught as bycatch in other fisheries and affected by habitat degradation (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2006, Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vincent <em>et al</em>. 2011). Trade surveys conducted by Project Seahorse between 1995-2000 indicate that while the global trade of seahorses and other syngnathids appears to be increasing, fishers and other informants reported considerable declines in seahorse availability throughout the range of this species, without a commensurate decrease in effort (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2006, Meeuwig <em>et al</em>. 2006, Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Evanson <em>et al</em>. 2011). While the absolute volume of this trade, and the proportion of the population that it represents, is unknown at this point, reported declines in numbers give reason for concern and there is no doubt that this trade is negatively effecting wild populations With the main threats to <em>H. kuda</em> likely to continue into the future we therefore suggest a precautionary listing of Vulnerable (VU A2cd+3cd+4cd).&#160;<br/> <br/><em>Hippocampus kuda</em> is also threatened by damage to its habitats (Vincent <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2011) from coastal development and destructive fishing practices. Land-based activities such as coastal construction can diminish seagrass beds and mangroves while leading to increased pollution and siltation in surrounding marine waters. Some fishing methods such as trawling result in substantial damage seagrass beds (Short <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. 2011</span>).

The recorded maximum total length is 30 cm (stretched)&#160;(Paulus 1999).","In general, incidental capture in shrimp trawl fisheries and habitat  degradation and exploitation are the main threats to this species.&#160; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. kuda </span>is susceptible to incidental catch from trawling in many locations throughout its range (Giles <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Perry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>.  2010).  In China, Cambodia and the Republic of Korea seahorses are  caught as bycatch although no information exists on volumes (UNEP-WCMC  2012b). <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> Declines in Thailand  of seahorse catches are attributed to overfishing, as well as an increasing number  of fishers, trawling, and habitat destruction (Perry <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).<br/><br/><em>Hippocampus kuda</em> is caught and traded for traditional medicines, aquaria and curios throughout its range (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Trade in this species is extensive with over 2 million individuals traded per annum (Evanson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a).<br/><br/><em>Hippocampus kuda</em> is also threatened by damage to its habitats (Vincent <em>et al. </em>2011) from coastal development and destructive fishing practices. Land-based activities such as coastal construction can diminish seagrass beds and mangroves while leading to increased pollution and siltation in surrounding marine waters.

The decline in and fragmentation of the species’ habitats throughout its range indicates possible declines in populations in addition to those caused by fisheries.<strong><br/></strong><br/> All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Vincent <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al</em>.   1999). These life history parameters often make species susceptible to   exploitation as has been demonstrated for a number of species,  including  seahorses (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 1998, Foster and Vincent  2004).  Although seahorses also have some traits, such as small body  size, fast  growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to  exploitation  pressures (Morgan 2007), <br/><br/>Due to the mode of spawning exhibited by <em>Hippocampus kuda</em> (ovoviviparous brood pouch male parental care), fecundity<em> </em>is comparatively low compared to non-brood pouch spawning fishes and therefore its capacity for population growth is more limited than other species&#160;(Brown&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). As a result of the lack of broadcast spawning of pelagic eggs, dispersal of potential recruits is limited. Additionally, given the limited swimming abilities of seahorses, it is highly unlikely that rescue effects would occur from adjacent populations.<br/><br/><br/><p></p>","While exact population numbers for <em>Hippocampus kuda</em> remain unknown, Project Seahorse trade surveys conducted between 1995 and 2000 give us reason to suspect that seahorse numbers in the wild appear to have declined throughout its range. For example, in 1998 and 1999 in Thailand 81% of surveyed fishers (n=30 of 37) and 71% of fishers in Malaysia (n = 37 of 52) reported that in general, seahorse numbers including <em>H. kuda</em> are decreasing (Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010). Overfishing, an increase in the number of fishers, and indiscriminate catch by trawlers, were cited as causes of decline by fishermen in both countries (Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Hong Kong traders reported that local seahorses, while common 30 years ago, were rarely found in 2000, with the decrease in availability attributed to habitat destruction and pollution (B. Kwan, unpublished data). These examples demonstrate &#160;that declines have been ongoing for well over 10 years. While measures are in place to regulate reported international trade, it has not declined and sub-national and illegal trade are expected to continue into the future.<br/><br/><span style="""">Preliminary genetic research from Thailand suggests that there are two separate populations in Thai waters: one in the Gulf of Thailand and one along the Andaman Coast (Panithanarak </span><span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span><span style=""""> 2010).

Trade in<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>this species is extensive. Since the implementation of the listing of all <em>Hippocampus </em>species   on CITES Appendix II in 2004, trade in this species alone has been   recorded at over 2 million individuals per annum (Evanson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a). International trade 2004-2010 consisted primarily of live animals and dried bodies, with smaller quantities of specimens and derivatives also reported (UNEP-WCMC 2012a). Trade was principally wild-sourced (Evanson<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a). The vast majority of trade was for commercial purposes, and the main range States involved in exporting were Vietnam, Thailand and China (Evanson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a). Historically, high levels of trade in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. kuda </span>were  reported from India from 1992 until the ban of seahorse exports in 2001  (Marichamy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1993, Vincent 1996, Sreepada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002). Actual global trade in <em>Hippocampus</em> spp. is thought to be significantly higher than the legal trade reported (Nijman 2010, Vincent <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Koldewey and Martin-Smith (2010) reported that demand for <em>Hippocampus</em> spp. could not yet be met through aquaculture, but noted that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. kuda</span> was among the seven species accounting for more than 99 per cent of international trade in live captive-bred specimens. Many range states report that illegal trading and incidental capture in shrimp trawl fisheries remain problematic (UNEP-WCMC 2012b).&#160;<br/><br/> The Australian populations of this species were moved under the  Australian Wildlife Protection Act in 1998, so export permits are now  required.  The permits are only granted for approved management plans or  captive-bred animals.  Such management was transferred under the new  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in 2001.  Many  states also placed their own controls on the capture and/or trade of  syngnathid fishes.  <br/><br/>All seahorses are listed on Schedule I of India’s  Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, banning their capture and trade. In  2011 Cambodia and China banned wild seahorse exports. In Singapore, <em>H. kuda</em> is recognized as being threatened by  habitat destruction and harvesting for medicinal use and the aquarium  trade and harvest is not allowed except by permit.",Marine,"All <em>Hippocampus </em>species are listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This means that countries who are signatories to CITES are subject to regulations on the export of seahorses. Countries are required to provide permits for all exports of seahorses and are meant to provide evidence that these exports are not detrimental to wild populations. However a lack of basic information on distribution, habitat and abundance means many CITES Authorities cannot assess sustainability of their seahorse exploitation and meet their obligations to the convention. The challenge is particularly large in that most seahorses entering trade are caught incidentally as bycatch and thus imposing export quotas would achieve next to nothing for wild populations. Since this listing, an average annual trade of over two million individuals of <em>H. kuda</em> have been reported (Evanson <em>et al.</em> 2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a).&#160; The general lack of capacity in funding and manpower devoted to realizing enforcement that has been demonstrated by CITES authorities has further exacerbated trade issues.<br/><br/>CITES has recommended a minimum size limit of 10 cm height for all seahorse specimens in trade (CITES Decision 12.54). This limit represents a compromise between the best biological information available at the time of listing and perceived socioeconomic feasibility. But there is an urgent need for information on wild populations to assess their conservation status in order to take effective action and refine management recommendations. For example, evidence on variation in the spatial and temporal abundance of seahorses would enable areas of high seahorse density to be identified, as the basis for considering area restrictions on non-selective fishing gear that obtains <em>Hippocampus</em> species as bycatch. An understanding of the technical and logistical feasibility of returning to the sea live seahorses taken as bycatch in various types of fishing gear would provide the basis for considering the feasibility of minimum size limits and/or other output controls. Establishing a monitoring program of landings of seahorses at representative sites, taking into account different gear types and means of extraction and recording catch and effort metrics would allow assessment of conservation status and development management recommendations for various fishery types.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hippocampus kuda</span> is listed as vulnerable in the National Red Data Books of Singapore and Thailand, and endangered in the Red Data Book of Viet Nam.

This listing is consistent with the precautionary approach of the IUCN.&#160;<br/><br/> The primary threat to&#160;<em>Hippocampus trimaculatus&#160;</em>is bycatch in the multiple fisheries throughout its range&#160;and these fisheries are also known to cause damage to this species' habitat. This is one of the most traded species in the international seahorse trade (Evanson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a) and due to its large size and smooth/pale complexion it is much desired in the traditional&#160;Chinese&#160;medicine market (Vincent 1996).<br/><br/>Local surveys throughout this species' range indicate that there are declines in the availability and size of seahorses (Giles&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006,&#160;Perry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). These declines coupled with the extensive trade can be used to infer that there have been declines of at least 30% over the past 10 to 15 years and that these declines are expected to continue into the future.","<em>Hippocampus trimaculatus</em>&#160;is most often found at depths greater than 10 m with a maximum reported depth for this species being 100 m (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160; This species utilizes soft substrates such as sand and mud as well as macro algae and soft corals (Nguyen and Do 1996, Choo and Liew 2003, Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004). As these are similar habitats to where shrimp trawling often occurs (FAO 2008), this makes <em>H. trimaculatus </em>especially susceptible to exploitation as bycatch in the tropical shrimp trawl fishery. Shrimp trawling is also known to be causing a decline in the quality of these habitats (FAO 2008), which is suspected to effect <em>H. trimaculatus</em>.&#160;Although the habitat preferences of this species have not been studied in detail, anecdotal evidence suggests that, at least in Malaysia, this species prefers sandy and muddy substrates similar to those inhabited by tropical shrimp (Lim, <em>in. litt.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al. </em>1999) -&#160; traits that make seahorses especially vulnerable to over-exploitation. Seahorses also have some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to exploitation pressures (Morgan 2007). However a specialized life-history coupled with a dependence on relatively shallow habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation. The importance of life history parameters in determining response to exploitation has been demonstrated for a number of species, including seahorses (Jennings <em>et al.</em> 1998, Foster and Vincent 2004).","The primary threat to <em>Hippocampus trimaculatus </em>is bycatch in incidental and target fisheries throughout its range including Malaysia and Thailand (Choo and Liew 2003, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010), Vietnam (Giles <em>et al. </em>2005, Meeuwig <em>et al. </em>2006) and India (Salin <em>et al. </em>2005, Murugan <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;These fisheries, specifically shrimp and other trawl fisheries, are known to cause substantial damage to the habitats in which they occur (FAO 2001, FAO 2008).&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic; ""><br/></span><span style=""font-style: italic; ""><br/></span>Although the majority of seahorses are caught as bycatch, there are some small fisheries that target seahorses (Giles&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Salin <em>et al. </em>2005, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010), which are presumably driven by the demand for seahorses in traditional medicine and the aquarium trade.<br/><br/>Seahorses life history and ecological traits may increase their susceptibility to these threats (see Habitats and Ecology).","While detailed population numbers for <em>Hippocampus trimaculatus</em> remain unknown, analysis of international trade data shows that this is one of the species most often reported as being traded internationally, indicating heavy and widespread exploitation globally&#160;(UNEP-WCMC 2012a, Foster <em>et al. </em>2014). Also, local surveys throughout this species' range indicate that there are declines in the availability and size of seahorses: 30-60% declines over 2-5 years in Vietnam (Giles <em>et al. </em>2006); declines of 68+/-24% over 12.5 years in Malaysia and Thailand (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). In Hong Kong traders reported that local seahorses common 30 years ago  were rarely found in 2000, with the decrease in availability attributed  to habitat destruction and pollution (B.

This species<em> </em>is also traded live, for the aquarium trade, but the volumes are low (UNEP-WCMC 2012a; Foster <em>et al. </em>2014). The overall volume of trade in this species is very large and as a result <em>H. trimaculatus</em> was selected for the CITES Review of Significant Trade following COP 15 of CITES (UNEP-WCMC 2012b).<br/><br/>This species is relatively large and pale with smooth skin, all of which are known to be desirable traits in the traditional medicine trade (Vincent 1996) and may help to explain why it is so prevalent in trade.&#160;Indeed, since the implementation of the listing of all Hippocampus species on Appendix II of CITES in 2004, <em>Hippocampus trimaculatus&#160;</em>has been one of the top two species most reported to CITES as being traded internationally with an average of 1.8 million individuals reported in trade annually between 2004 and 2011 (Foster <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>The Australian populations of this species were moved under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, so export permits are now required. There is currently a national ban on the capture and trade of seahorses in the Philippines as per The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998: Republic Act No. 8550. Other countries such as Cambodia, China and Sri Lanka have also reported bans on trade in seahorses generally (UNEP-WCMC 2012b) but it is unclear if these have yet been implemented. Since 2001, all seahorses have been listed under Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, which bans trade in these species (Indian Ministry of Environments and Forests 2001).",Marine,"All <em>Hippocampus </em>species are listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This means that countries who are signatories to CITES are subject to regulations on the export of seahorses. Countries are required to provide permits for all exports of seahorses and are meant to provide evidence that these exports are not detrimental to wild populations. However a lack of basic information on distribution, habitat and abundance means many CITES Authorities cannot assess sustainability of their seahorse exploitation and meet their obligations to the Convention. &#160;The challenge is particularly large in that most seahorses entering trade are caught incidentally as bycatch and thus imposing export quotas would achieve next to nothing for wild populations.&#160;<br/><br/>CITES has recommended a minimum size limit of 10 cm height for all seahorse specimens in trade (CITES Decision 12.54). This limit represents a compromise between the best biological information available at the time of listing and perceived socio-economic feasibility. &#160;But we urgently need information on wild populations to assess their conservation status and take conservation action, as well as refine management recommendations. For example, evidence on variation in the spatial and temporal abundance of seahorses would enable areas of high seahorse density to be identified, as the basis for considering area restrictions on non-selective fishing gear that obtains <em>Hippocampus </em>species as bycatch. An understanding of the technical and logistical feasibility of returning to the sea live seahorses taken as bycatch in various types of fishing gear would provide the basis for considering the feasibility of minimum size limits and/or other output controls. Establishing monitoring program of landings of seahorses at representative sites, taking into account different gear types and means of extraction and recording catch and effort metrics would allow us to assess population conservation status and development management recommendations for various fishery types.",Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species is now considered rare globally, with local densities negatively correlated with fishing pressure across six Indo-Pacific locations, and with suspected local extinctions at some localities (Dulvy and Polunin 2004).  Underwater surveys across its range in suitable habitats, even at remote localities, have either failed to detect this species or have detected only rare individuals (Dulvy and Polunin 2004, T.J. Donaldson unpublished data of timed ""long-swim""/gps transects). Otherwise, it is abundant only on the Great Barrier Reef and at Rowley Shoals in northwestern Australia; juvenile <em>B. muricatum</em> appear to be very rare in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Bellwood and Choat 1989) but adults achieve their highest abundance on the Great Barrier Reef (mean = 31 fish per hectare) over the recorded range of this species (J.H. Choat pers. comm.).  Based on rapid visual census from a series of transects of 50x5 m at depth of 12 m on individual reefs at Coringa-Herald National Nature Reserve (located east of Cairns, Australia), the abundance of <em>B. muricatum</em> was estimated to range from 1 to 25 fish in northeast and southwest Herald (Oxley <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/> <br/>Elsewhere, it is relatively abundant in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and a few other oceanic islands, and is common locally at Samoa, Sipidan Island (Malaysia), Wake Island, the Red Sea and New Caledonia. Choat and Randall (1986) described <em>B. muricatum</em> as widely distributed in West Indian and Pacific Oceans, and was most commonly observed on reef fronts, reef crests and flats. At other locations, it is now uncommon or rare, and is virtually extinct in Guam, Marshall Islands, parts of Fiji and East Africa, and is declining rapidly in Palau (Myers 1991, Donaldson and Dulvy 2004, Dulvy and Polunin 2004, Donaldson unpubl. data). This species is naturally rare  in some parts of its range (e.g., Christmas Island, Amirantes and Farqhuar Atoll, Seychelles, and elsewhere in the Indian Ocean), a fact which cannot be attributed to over-fishing.(J.H. Choat pers. comm.). <em>B. muricatum</em> was rare around most the US Pacific Islands and was seen typically only at 1 or 2 islands of a region (e.g., US Line Islands, US Phoenix Islands, Marianas Archipelago, or American Samoan Islands) (R.H. Schroeder, Coral Reef Ecosystem Division of the NOAA, pers. comms. on 14th Aug 2006; 23rd and 29th Dec 2006).  <br/> <br/>See the Supplementary Material for the fishery-independent data. No fishery-dependent data are available either regionally or by country. <br/> <br/>Donaldson and Dulvy (2004) showed that the large-sized, long-lived <em>B. muricatum</em>, but with low replacement rates and high vulnerability to fishing pressure, appears to be of considerable functional importance (as a major bioeroder on coral reefs and maintain ecosystem resilience) which should be protected. <br/> <br/>Hamilton (2003) pointed out that the introduction of simple but new technologies coupled with small scale economic restructuring (from the mid 1970s till the end of 1980s, there were no cash markets for <em>B. muricatum</em>; greater financial development in late 1980s ended up in the development of fisheries projects; by the mid 1990s, fillets of <em>B. muricatum</em> were bought at a higher price than any other fish - commercialization) of the <em>B. muricatum</em> fishery in Solomon Islands has overexploited its stock which is in need of management. <br/> <br/>As parrotfish are the only fish group capable of consuming reef carbonate, Bellwood <em>et al</em>. (2003) indicated that <em>B. muricatum</em> plays a crucial role in reef ecosystem processes, and its absence highlights the potential for marked changes in ecosystem function (shifting from steady-state reef calcification to carbonate accumulation). <br/> <br/>Dulvy and Polunin (2004) revealed that informal methods of inferring whether a species is naturally rare or has declined  or disappeared as a result of human activity could aid efforts to provide a more accurate estimate of the contemporary marine extinction rate in such data-poor situations. <br/> <br/>In the Solomon Islands, Aswani and Hamilton (2004) stated that protection of the highly fecund large females would enhance the sustainability of the Roviana fishery. <br/> <br/>Donaldson and Dulvy (2004) recommended (1) implementing a moratorium on commercial fishing and export; (2) educating stakeholders and the general public on the importance of conserving <em>B. muricatum</em>; (3) creating and enforcing larger marine reserves that incorporate key habitat; and (4) carrying further research on its population ecology and behaviour. <br/> <br/>D. Fenner (pers. comm., 22nd Oct 2006) suggested that it is important to protect and monitor <em>B. muricatum</em>, a coral predator, because its removal might have effects on coral reef ecosystem with unknown consequences. <br/> <br/>Gillett and Moy (2006) suggested that <em>B. muricatum</em> (a species that is inherently not very resilient to fishing pressure) should be a conceptual issue for consideration on the control of the fishing gear selectivity (especially selectivity of spearfishing). <br/> <br/>Russ and Alcala (1998) suggested that the small size of most marine protected areas in heavily fished regions would show little positive effects on reef-bioeroding parrotfish abundances. <br/> <br/>G.R. Allen (pers. comm. 16 January 2007) recommended blanket protection of this species, offering the ""chance for the numerous immature fish to grow and form the nucleus of the globally exceptional concentration"" of this giant reef fish. <br/> <br/>For this historically abundant species, more information on its present abundance, biology, age-and-growth and management practices is recommended before it disappears due to unsustainable exploitation. <br/> <br/>Given all the above information it seems reasonable to infer at least a 30% population reduction of the Humphead Parrotfish in the last three generations (the last 30 years) due to over-exploitation in parts of its range.","This species is gregarious and occurs in aggregations of up to several (&gt; 75) individuals on seaward and clear outer lagoon reefs at depths of 1 to 30m; also enters outer reef flats at low tide to forage. Pelagic spawning on a lunar cycle; utilises resident spawning aggregations sites (Johannes 1981, Gladstone 1986).  Eggs and larvae are pelagic. Primarily a corallivore, but also feeds upon benthic algae; this species uses its large gibbus head to ram corals and break them into pieces that are more easily ingested. Aggregations of this species are important producers of coral sand on reefs and may be important in the maintenance of ecosystem resilience (Bellwood <em>et al</em>. 2003).  Reportedly wary on reefs near human settlement or use.  This species sleeps in large groups, thus rendering them highly vulnerable to exploitation by spearfishers (mainly in the Pacific region) and netters at night (Myers 1999). <br/> <br/>Additional notes, as follows: <br/> <br/>Exposed reef crests are the primary habitat of <em>B. muricatum</em> (J.H. Choat, pers. comm. on 4th Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>In unfished areas, <em>B. muricatum</em> may enter outer reef flats at depths of 1 to at least 30 m (Myers 1991). <br/> <br/>Lieske and Myers (1994) observed that juveniles can be found in lagoons, while adults are in clear outer lagoon and seaward reefs at depths of at least 30 m. <br/> <br/>Very small individuals are restricted to the shallow inner lagoon in Solomon Islands (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>At Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands, juveniles are limited to the shallow inner lagoon environment, while larger individuals occur predominantly in passages (Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/><em>B. muricatum</em> feeds substantially on live coral (Gladstone 1986, Myers 1991, Bellwood <em>et al</em>. 2003) and benthic algae (Randall <em>et al</em> 1990). <br/> <br/>Gladstone (1986) described <em>B. muricatum</em> as generally timid and difficult to approach. <br/> <br/>Bellwood et al (2003) reported that <em>B. muricatum</em> produces significant bioerosion in the Indo-Pacific.  Based on 132 timed transects (20-min long, 5 m wide) at 9 reefs in the Great Barrier Reef, schools of 30 to 50 huge (up to 120 cm TL) specimens with each individual removing 2.33 m³ or 5.69 tonnes of structural reef carbonate each year. <br/> <br/><strong>Spawning</strong> <br/>Spawning behaviour in a tightly packed school of about 100 individuals (pair spawning activities among this mobile group) was observed from the seafloor (15 m deep) to about 2 m below the surface on the morning of January 15, 1985 in Great Barrier Reef (Gladstone 1986).  None of the <em>B. muricatum</em> in the spawning school was smaller than about 60 cm TL (Gladstone 1986). Choat and Randall (1986) recorded a group spawning (40 to 50 fish) on the outer face of Yonge reef in Great Barrier Reef during December 1983. <br/> <br/><strong>Sexual Pattern</strong> <br/>Randall and Bruce (1983) had suggested sex inversion occurs in <em>B. muricatum</em>.  J.H. Choat, pers. comm., 18 September 2006) stated that this species does not appear to be diandric; there is an extended prereproductive period of sexual differentiation from which males are produced. <br/> <br/><strong>Fecundity and Recruitment</strong> <br/>Information not available","<em>B. muricatum</em> forms mixed sized schools and is extremely vulnerable to overfishing (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>Shoaling and group resting behaviour render <em>B. muricatum</em> highly vulnerable to spearfishing, particularly at night-time (Donaldson and Dulvy 2004) and mainly in the Pacific region (J.H. Choat pers. comm.). Spearfishing at night has reduced the numbers of <em>B. muricatum</em> (Gladstone 1986, D. Fenner pers. comm. on 27th July 2006). <br/> <br/>In Roviana Lagoon (Solomon Islands), artisanal spear fishers use their sophisticated indigenous knowledge of the spawning behaviour and ecology of <em>B. muricatum</em> to catch as many fish as possible in a night (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>The belief that <em>B. muricatum</em> predominantly aggregate at night around the new moon period and that catch rates are far greater during the new moon was not supported by field survey done in 2000-2001 (Aswani and Hamilton 2004). <br/> <br/>Dulvy and Polunin (2004) suggested that the decline of <em>B. muricatum</em> in the Lau Group in Fiji was mainly due its nocturnal aggregative behaviour in shallow lagoon water or in reef caves and the daytime foraging of shoals in depth accessible by spearfishermen. <br/> <br/><em>B. muricatum</em> was often captured for ceremonial events, indicating this species has a high cultural significant value in the Lau Island group, Fiji (Dulvy and Polunin 2004). <br/> <br/>Low priority to enforcing legislation related to spearfishing in Fiji (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>In 2001, the Samoa Fisheries Projected reported that SCUBA spearfishing activities at night had been increased rapidly in the past 12 months, in which <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the target species (Gillett and Moy 2006). <br/> <br/>Gillett and Moy (2006) pointed out that sleeping <em>B. muricatum</em> was one of the three main types of fish to be targeted by spearfishing.<br/><br/>Parrotfishes show varying degrees of habitat preference and utilization  of coral reef habitats, with some species spending the majority of their  life stages on coral reefs, while others primarily utilize seagrass  beds, mangroves, algal beds, and /or rocky reefs. Although the majority  of the parrotfishes occur in mixed habitat (primarily inhabiting  seagrass beds, mangroves, and rocky reefs) approximately 78% of these  mixed habitat species are experiencing greater than 30% loss of coral  reef area and habitat quality across their distributions. Of those  species that occur exclusively in coral reef habitat, more than 80% are  experiencing a greater than 30% of coral reef loss and degradation  across their distributions. However, more research is needed to  understand the long-term effects of habitat loss and degradation on  these species populations. Widespread coral reef loss and declining  habitat conditions are particularly worrying for species that depend on  live coral reefs for food and shelter especially as studies have shown  that protection of pristine habitats facilitate the persistence of adult  populations in species that have spatially separated adult and juvenile  habitats. Furthermore, coral reef loss and declining habitat conditions  are particularly worrying for some corallivorous excavating  parrotfishes that play major roles in reef dynamics and sedimentation  (Comeros-Raynal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012).<strong></strong>","<em>B. muricatum</em> are locally patchily distributed, adults always found in small shoals (&lt;= 40 individuals) (Donaldson and Dulvy 2004). <br/> <br/>Choat and Randall (1986) stated <em>B. muricatum</em> does not display sex-associated patterns of colour change, maintaining a uniform body colouration in adult females and males. Juvenile shows a distinct colour pattern. <br/> <br/>Hamilton (2003) described <em>B. muricatum</em> is the largest of all parrotfish, reaching over 50 kg and living to an age of at least 40 years. <br/> <br/>Gladstone (1986) revealed that <em>B. muricatum</em> individuals usually occur as part of schools containing 20 to almost 100 fish which often move into shallow waters during feeding around Lizard Island in Great Barrier Reef. <br/> <br/>Based on a histological analysis of gonad collected from 169 females in Solomon Islands in 2000-2001, the size of maturity was found to be 620 mm FL, in which some specimens as small as 610 mm FL showed significant gonad development (Hamilton 2003). <br/> <br/>Hamilton and Adams (unpubl. data) showed that 100% female maturity occurs at 650 mm SL. <br/> <br/>FishBase 2006 (www.fishbase.org) estimates that the minimum population doubling time ranges from 4.5 to 14 years; this estimate is derived from a formula that utilizes length and infinity (Linf), length at maximum yield (Lopt), time at length ""0"" (t0) and K (= 0.10), and may need to be recalculated given the maximum age of this species (J.H. Choat, pers. comm., 18 September 2006).  FishBase (2006) calculates that the decline threshold equals 0.85; this species is vulnerable to extinction if this threshold value is exceeded over the longer of 10 years or three generations. <br/> <br/><strong>Sex composition</strong> <br/>Information not available <br/> <br/><strong>Length-age relationship</strong> <br/>Information not available.",Decreasing,"Recorded from the Red Sea east to the Line Islands and Tuamotu Archipelago (French Polynesia), north to Taiwan, the Yaeyama Islands (Japan), and Wake Island (United States Minor Outlying Islands), south to northwest Australia, the Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia (Randall <em>et al</em>. 1990, Myers 1999).","<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">This species is c</strong>onsumed as food.

It has been collected or reported from 12 marine blue holes, inland caves, and deep fracture oriented chasms on eight different islands (eight locations) throughout the Little and Great Bahama Bank Islands from 0-28 m depth. It is understood that the taxonomy of the <em>Lucifuga</em> genus is not yet complete, but is currently being researched. The species' extent of occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 323 km². Although data are limited, the population size of <em>L. spelaeotes</em> is potentially small. The characteristic low levels of oxygen within these caves is another significant limiting factor. Data on the life history of <em>L. spelaeotes</em> are limited. Spawning may occur infrequently with a relatively low fecundity and long gestation period. It has been inferred that <em>Lucifuga</em> species have a long generation length.<br/><br/>Threats to cave-dwelling species in the Caribbean include habitat degradation through rock removal or siltation, hydrological manipulations caused by water removal, environmental pollution, and the introduction of alien species. Typically, a cave that is near high densities of human populations is more threatened.

Due to the already harsh nature of this environment, even slight changes in cave water quality can negatively affect troglobitic organisms, which have already adapted with very low metabolic rates and small size so as to efficiently use energy when oxygen and food supply are lacking (Hutchinson 1999, Bishop&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Gonzalez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;<br/><p>Food availability is a significant limiting factor for these cave fishes. Gonzalez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2011) reported that food webs in these caves may be dependent on indigenous bacterial primary production.&#160;Populations of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. seem to remain stable throughout the year, but the populations of the invertebrates that constitute their diet fluctuate significantly (Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012).&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. are opportunistic, passive foragers that primarily prey on troglobitic amphipods and mysids, but will also eat crustaceans and shrimp&#160;(Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999, Trajano 2001, Moller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;The highest densities of<em>&#160;L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;are&#160;usually observed hiding under ledges and in dark alcoves near the entrance where prey items such as&#160;the hypogean shrimp,&#160;<em>Barbouria cubensis</em>&#160;tend to congregate (Trajano 2001, Moller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). It&#160;has also been reported together with the grapsid crab,&#160;<em>Sesarma angustipes,</em>&#160;in Uncle Charlie's Blue Hole on Andros Island (Proudlove 2006).&#160;Vegetable matter was found in the digestive tract of the holotype of&#160;<em>Lucifuga simile, </em>a closely related species endemic to Cuba. Populations of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. are significantly more abundant in caves that bats also inhabit because their guano fertilizes the water and promotes growth of food sources for the fish (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999). &#160;</p><p>Data on the reproductive strategy of&#160;<em>L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;are limited, however, two other species of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;that are endemic to freshwater caves in Cuba have a breeding peak in March, with females carrying 2-15 embryos that are approximately 2.5 cm SL at birth (Eigenmann 1909).&#160;The ovaries in female fishes of the&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Ogilbia</em>&#160;genera are very similar, however, sexual structures of the male, though both intromittent,<span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5""><span class=""sheader5"">&#160;are different.&#160;Male fishes are characterized by the presence of an external reproductive organ anterior to the anal fin, which it uses to facilitate internal fertilization of females (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999).

spelaeotes</em>&#160;may be experiencing direct threats from habitat degradation and introduced alien species. Repeated efforts to contact the Bahamas National Trust to determine an update on the status of these cave systems in which&#160;<em>L.&#160;</em><em>spelaeotes</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Lucifuga&#160;</em><em>lucayana </em>have occurred has not yet been answered, though it could be inferred that the Lucayan Caverns have a low level of impact due to their protected status. Proudlove (2001) described five main threats to cave-dwelling species: habitat degradation through rock removal or siltation, hydrological manipulations caused by water removal, environmental pollution, overexploitation, and the introduction of alien species. On multiple occasions, people have reported evidence of trash, sewage, industrial pollution, and competition from introduced species in caves throughout the range of all Caribbean&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. (Hutchinson 1999,&#160;Proudlove 2001, Proudlove 2006,&#160;Moller <em>et al.</em> 2006, Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011). The level of impact and rate of occurrence of these disturbances directly correlates to the location of the cave/hole in relation to human population density. A hole/cave that is distantly located and difficult to access will remain more pristine and unaltered (Proudlove 2001). In contrast, increasing human population density around a subterranean habitat is a threat. There is concern that caves that are proximal to dense human populations could be exposed to insecticide spraying&#160;(Hutchinson 1999).&#160;In 2005, an expedition to Alphonso Dean's Blue Hole on Southern Long Island, where&#160;<em>L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;was collected in 1985, did not find fish, but did report the presence of shrimp and a large amount of trash such as tires and rusted metal, which may have negatively impacted the water quality (Moller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;This species has not been observed at its type locality (Mermaid's Pool on New Providence Island) following reports of an illegal sewage dump into the hole and encroaching housing developments. It was found in the R.M. Bailey School Cave on the same island coexisting with mosquitofish and various rubbish such as two sunken automobiles, of which there was a subsequent cleanup (Proudlove 2001, Moller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/>Scuba divers can be detrimental to these caves when they disturb the stratification of bacterial mats that lie near the halocline, enrich the levels of oxygen in the water, and perhaps introduce flora and fauna to the system. Though some opinions are that any information gained from further exploration of these environments may overcome the possible negative effects especially because a small proportion of these holes are likely to be affected by such activity (Hutchinson 1999,&#160;Proudlove 2001).","Cave-diving expeditions can be logistically challenging and dangerous to undertake,&#160;therefore population data for&#160;<em>Lucifuga spelaeotes</em>&#160;are limited.&#160;The <em>Lucifuga</em> genus continues to evolve due to the discovery of new species in previously unexplored caves throughout the Caribbean. It will be difficult to grasp a complete understanding of the populations of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. until a more detailed picture of their diversity and distribution is realized (Moller&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Garcia-Machado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;Garcia-Machado and Hernandez (2012) reported that populations of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp. tend to remain stable throughout the year.&#160;It&#160;was originally described from two specimens collected&#160;from a brackish sinkhole in 1970.&#160;The species description was updated&#160;in 2006 from a collection of 44 specimens.&#160;The population size was&#160;calculated&#160;as less than 1,000&#160;individuals (Moller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).",Unknown,"The distributions of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. are highly patchy, as they are only found in inland karst caves located near coastal margins (Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Lucifuga spelaeotes</em> has been collected or reported from 12 marine blue holes, inland caves, and deep fracture oriented chasms on eight different islands throughout the Little and Great Bahama Bank Islands from 0-28 m depth (Smith 1997, Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006, Proudlove 2006). Moller <em>et al</em>. (2006) breaks down the known localities as such: Grand Bahama Island: Lucayan Caverns and Zodiac Caverns, Abaco Island: Inland sink hole, Berry Islands, Andros Island: ocean blue holes and Uncle Charlie’s Blue Hole, New Providence Island: Mermaid’s Pool and R.M. Bailey School Cave, Eleuthera Island: Nixon’s Blue Hole and Sink Hole, Great Exuma Island: Angelfish Blue Hole, and Long Island. The range of <em>L. spelaeotes</em> is separated from that of <em>L. lucayana</em> by the deep waters of the Providence Channels. The EOO is estimated at 323 km². When <em>L. spelaeotes</em> was listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List in 1996 (World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1996), the AOO was calculated as less than 100 km² with the number of recorded locations as less than five (Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006).",<em>Lucifuga spelaeotes</em> is not utilized.,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;species play an important ecological role in the balance of caves that they inhabit (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999). The threats of ongoing habitat degradation by human activities within the&#160;extremely limited distribution&#160;and&#160;the more recent widespread introduction of alien species that deplete the limited food supply of&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;spp.&#160;require the attention of conservationists.&#160;Since species diversity for the&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;genus is likely&#160;underestimated due to the incomplete exploration of their highly fragmented distribution, implementing conservation&#160;could&#160;be difficult without a more complete list of specific holes/caves that currently harbor populations&#160;(Garcia-Machado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/>The Lucayan Caves are contained within the Lucayan National Park, which is managed by the Bahamas National Trust, an organization tasked with the conservation of the country's natural resources.&#160;Diving in the Lucayan Caves is regulated to certain areas and is allowed only by special permission from the&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Underwater Explorers Society to experienced and trained divers</span>. Details on diving in the Zodiac Caverns and holes on Abaco Island are not available at this time.&#160;The Bahamas Caves Research Foundation, drafted a proposal&#160;in the year 2010&#160;that would protect 17 blue holes&#160;on Great Abaco Island&#160;and create awareness about cave conservation (Kakuk and Patterson 2010). Efforts to contact both the BNT and BCRF via email to request further information on conservation measures specific to these cave environments were largely unanswered.&#160;Proudlove (2001) reported that most&#160;<em>Lucifuga</em>&#160;species listed as threatened or more are not receiving necessary conservation attention.&#160;Habitat management, monitoring, education, and economic activities surrounding subterranean cave systems should be considered during the planning process (Garcia-Machado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012).<br/>Exploring captive breeding of this species would be useful if populations became depleted enough to require restocking&#160;(Proudlove 2001). It is important to note that&#160;<em>Lucifuga simile</em>&#160;has been raised successfully on a diet of&#160;<em>Troglocubanus</em>&#160;sp. (cave shrimp) (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999).&#160;Further research on rearing&#160;<em>L</em><em>.</em><em>&#160;spelaeotes</em>&#160;should be explored.<br/>In 1996 and 2000,&#160;<em>L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;was listed by the IUCN as VU (A1ce, B1 + 2bc, D2) based on decline in area, habitat quality, and pollution. The population was estimated as less than 1,000, the AOO as less than 100 km<sup>2</sup>, and the number of locations as less than 5.&#160;Proudlove (2001, 2006) concluded that the population and number of locations were underestimated because other populations known from&#160;Grand Bahama, Abaco, Andros, Long, and Berry Islands&#160;were not included. He also maintains that there are threats to the populations on New Providence due to pollution and introductions of alien species, but that those on other islands are under less pressure due to their seclusion from human activities. If these criteria were to be accepted, Proudlove states that&#160;<em>L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;would be down-listed to Least Concern. Moller <em>et al. </em>(2006) replied with the argument that&#160;<em>L. spelaeotes</em>&#160;is now known from only 5 confirmed islands after a revision of the species description where&#160;<em>Lucifuga lucayana,&#160;</em>a new Bahamian species, was also included. Therefore, he strongly recommends maintaining the current D2 status&#160;until the diversity and distribution of these two species are further explored.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species is threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries and/or by being targeted for use in the aquarium trade, and by ongoing habitat degradation and loss. It is traded for traditional medicines, curios, and aquarium use. It is suspected through fisher interviews in the late 1990s and early 2000s that the species had undergone a decline of at least 30% over the previous 10 years. <span><span>It is suspected that these threats are&#160;likely contributing to further declines, and thus that the previous estimate is still applicable. No further studies on population size or trends or on threats to the species have been undertaken since the previous assessment. Therefore this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd.</span>","<em>Hippocampus erectus</em> occurs in water up to 100 m (Freret-Meurer and Andreata 2011), and is associated with aquatic vegetation such as mangroves (mostly <em>Rhizophora mangle</em>&#160;and<em> Avicennia sp.</em>), <em>Caulerpa spp</em>.,&#160;<em>Carijoa sp.</em>, seagrass (<em>Thalassia&#160;testudinum, Halophila sp.</em>),&#160;as well as coral, rocky and oyster reef habitats,&#160;floating <em>Sargassum</em>, and sponges (Fish and Mowbray 1970,&#160;Lieske and Myers 1994,&#160;&#160;McAllister 1990 in Lourie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999,&#160;Dias&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, Hare <em>et al.</em> 2006).  <em>Hippocampus erectus</em> can be found at the surface and bottom of both shallow water and deeper areas of channels in bays, along beaches, in or near salt marshes, anchialine lakes, and over oyster beds and weed-covered banks (Hardy 1978, Rose&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). In Brazil it has been found in water with a salinity of 45% (Dias <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em>&#160; </em>&#160;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9e6-51ba-9a6c-1e15d07c08c4"">Little is known about their feeding, but they likely have diets similar to those exhibited by other seahorses which include mysids, amphipods, copepods, and gammarid shrimps (Woods 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Felicio <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kitsos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Yip <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;<span><br/><em>Hippocampus erectus </em>is&#160;ovoviviparous, and males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). The maximum size for the species&#160;is 18.5cm; the maximum reported height at onset of sexual maturity is 5.6 cm (Baum <em>et al.</em> 2003). Both males and females are fully mature at 12 cm, and the average brood size for this species is 250 to 300 eggs (although larger males can produce over 1200)(Fritzsche 2002, Baum<em> et al. </em>2003, Dunham 2010). <em>Hippocampus erectus&#160;</em>matures during the ﬁrst reproductive season after birth at six to twelve months of age, and has a gestation period of 20–21 days, varying with water temperature&#160;(Lourie <em>et al.</em> 1999). The egg diameter is 0.15 cm and the young approximately 0.49cm long at birth (Dunham 2010). The reproductive period for this species is apparently from May to October. The number of eggs/embryos inside the brood pouch of males with a total length ranging from 8cm to 12.6cm, from 97 to 1,552; number of prehydrated oocytes in females with a total length ranging from 6cm to 12.3cm, from 90 to 1,313. Newborns are released by ejection from the brood pouch by body contortions and pumping action of the pouch (Teixeira and Musick 2001).&#160;<span><br/><br/><span>This species is known to develop elaborate skin fronds and males have proportionally longer tails than do females (Baum <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/><em><br/></em>This species may be particularly susceptible to decline.&#160;&#160; All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Vincent&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). <br/></span></span>","<em>Hippocampus erectus</em> is threatened by being caught as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries and by being targeted for the aquarium trade. The species is traded dried as traditional medicine, curios, and live for aquariums (Vincent <em>et al.</em> 2011).  This is a popular aquarium fish in North America.  In Florida alone, thousands of <em>H. erectus</em> are collected each year for the aquarium trade (P. LaFrance unpublished data 2003).  <em>Hippocampus erectus</em> is Brazil’s 6th most important marine ornamental export (Monteiro-Neto <em>et al</em>. 2000).  In addition to being sold as traditional medicines, <em>H. erectus</em> are sold as curios in Mexico along the Caribbean coast (J. Baum unpublished data).  <em>Hippocampus erectus</em> are often brought up as bycatch by shrimp trawling operations in Florida (Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003), and in Mexico seahorse population declines are attributed to indirect harvesting by the shrimp trawl fishery (J. Baum unpublished data).  In Central America <em>H. erectus</em> are brought up in the shrimp trawls in Belize, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and are exported as TCM, or sold on both coasts as curios (Baum and Vincent 2005).  Similarly in South America <em>H. erectus</em> are among the bycatch of shrimp trawls in Mar del Plata, Argentina (L. Magnasco in litt. to A. Vincent 23 May 1999), and in Brazil (I. Rosa and J. Baum unpublished data).   <br/> <br/>The preferred habitats of <em>H. erectus</em>&#160;(seagrasses, corals and mangroves) is also declining due to coastal development, pollution, destructive fishing practices such as trawling, and increased sedimentation (Carpenter <em>et al. </em>2008, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010, Short <em>et al.</em> 2011, Jackson <em>et al. </em>2014).  For example, in NE Brazil the development of shrimp farms has destroyed much of the coastal mangrove habitats where seahorses live (J. Gomezjuardo in litt. to A. Vincent Sept. 1999).","To date there have been no dedicated <em>in situ </em>surveys or population estimates for <em>Hippocampus erectus.&#160;</em><br/><br/>Project Seahorse trade surveys conducted between 2000–2001 indicated that seahorse numbers in the wild appear to have declined in the Western Atlantic (Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico), with fishers reporting decreases in catch of seahorses (proportion of declines that can be attributed to <em>H. erectus</em> is unknown).  On the coast of Mexico 21/29 fishers in five locations reported declines in seahorses due to the shrimp trawl fishery.  Of the 14 fishers who provided quantified catch estimates, eight estimated declines between 75–90% in the past 10–30 years (Baum <em>et al. </em>2003).  In Brazil 25/29 fishers surveyed reported declines in seahorse catches due to heavy fishing pressures (I. Rosa, unpublished data).  In Honduras 70% of interviewed fishers (n=9) believed there has been a decline in abundance (Baum and Vincent 2005).  In all cases other fishers indicated stability in the seahorse population. <br/><br/>While we recognise that these surveys and reported population declines are outdated and do not encompass the global range of <em>H. erectus</em>, more  comprehensive, recent studies of the population are not available. Given  that the major threats (exploitation and habitat degradation) have not  ceased, and may be accelerating, we suspect that  the previous global estimate&#160;of at least a 30% decline over 10 years  (three generation lengths)&#160;is still applicable.<br/><br/>This species has been listed as Vulnerable at the regional scale based on population declines&#160;in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p><span>",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus erectus</em>&#160;is distributed in the western Atlantic from the southern tip of Nova Scotia, Canada, south along the east coast of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea to Bahia, Brazil (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2014, Boehm <em>et al. </em>2015). It has also been collected from Banco Acores (Azores Archipelago)&#160;in the eastern Atlantic, although it's not clear whether there is an established population there (Woodall<em>&#160;et al. </em>2009).

Seahorses also provide more tractable study taxa than many other small fish species due to their limited movement and site fidelity (Foster and Vincent 2005).

Dried seahorses were usually sold unadorned or as key chains. Occasionally some of them were sold as jewellery, shell crafts with shells and sea stars, or as 'dragons' with wings and eyes attached. These dried seahorses were sometimes ground and consumed in a drink as folk medicine to treat asthma. Chinese populations in Panama and Peru sold seahorses commercially as medicine, for use as TCM. The live seahorses were traded as aquarium fishes. Also, in some countries, including Honduras and Costa Rica, they had&#160;<em>in situ&#160;</em>value because dive masters would take tourists to particular sites where these seahorses were located. It is believed that most live trades occur almost entirely on the black market, thus meaning that no records have been kept of the fishery or trade&#160;(Baum and Vincent 2005).&#160;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9e3-0cc7-c0c7-17bd98344e02"">A study conducted to see how icthyofauna are used in traditional medicine in Brazil reports several uses of this species.

This is a large eagle ray with a widespread distribution across the Indo-Pacific in tropical and warm-temperate waters. Recorded over the continental shelf from the surface to 60 m depth in coastal and open ocean environments. It sometimes enters lagoons and estuaries and is often associated with coral reef ecosystems. <br/><br/>The Ocellated Eagle Ray is recorded from landing sites across much of its range, particularly within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. It is susceptible to capture from a variety of fishing gear and its range overlaps with areas of intense and generally unregulated fisheries in coastal and offshore environments. Estuarine habitats in which it occurs are affected by development and pollution across parts of its range.<br/><br/>The Ocellated Eagle Ray has low population rebound potential with low fecundity (1-4 pups per litter); long gestation period (12 months) and possibly 2-3 years between pregnancies; late maturation (five years), and an approximate 12-year generation period. Molecular studies demonstrate considerable population structuring for this eagle ray within the Indo-Pacific region, suggesting limited recruitment to exploited populations. Based on inferred population declines of &gt;30% across much of its range, with ongoing threats due to largely unregulated fishing pressure and habitat degradation and destruction, the Ocellated Eagle Ray has a global assessment of Vulnerable. In Australian and Oceania waters (Pacific Island nations) where there is limited fishing pressure and some conservation measures in place through the use of marine reserves, this species is assessed as Least Concern.","The Ocellated Eagle Ray is found in tropical and warm-temperate waters in coastal regions and over the continental shelf from the surface to 60 m depth (Compagno and Last 1999). It sometimes enters lagoons and estuaries and is often associated with coral reef ecosystems (Michael 1993, Homma <em>et al</em>. 1994, Last and Stevens 2009). It is also encountered well offshore in open water (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). Around coral reef environments, the Ocellated Eagle Ray often enters coral lagoons to feed (for example, Pohnpei Island, Federated States of Micronesia; Homma <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Reproduction is viviparous with aplacental histotrophy (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). Little information is available on reproductive biology although it is known to have low fecundity, bearing up to four pups per litter (Last and Stevens 2009). Homma <em>et al</em>. (1994) observed three gravid females in the Caroline Islands, two individuals carrying a single embryo and one carrying two embryos. Schluessel <em>et al</em>. (2010) observed a single mature female in Australia with four embryos. Gestation has been reported at 12 months (Michael 1993) and reproductive periodicity may not be annual (Schluessel <em>et al</em>. 2010). Based on a few samples only, the left uterus appears to be functional (Schluessel <em>et al</em>. 2010). These factors combine for a limited reproductive output and generation length is approximately 12 years. This species is reported to reach sexual maturity after 4-6 years (Last and Stevens 2009). Maximum size of 330 cm disc width (DW) has been reported but the species is more commonly observed to about 160 cm DW (Compagno and Last 1999, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). Size at maturity is reported as &gt;150 cm DW (Schluessel <em>et al</em>. 2010) for females, and 100-110 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010) or 130 cm DW (Schluessel <em>et al</em>. 2010) for males. Size at birth is 33-36 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Catches taken in the protective shark nets off the beaches of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, occur throughout the year but peak in summer (January and February) (Young 2001). The overall sex ratio is unity but there is a significant association between sex and time of year, with more males than females caught in summer and more females than males in winter. Median DW for each sex is 100 cm (Young 2001). Catches are rare in the southern part of the netted region, an apparent consequence of lower water temperatures (Young 2001).","Details of catches of the Ocellated Eagle Ray throughout its range are scant. Nevertheless, its small litter size, schooling behaviour, inshore habitat and hence availability to a wide variety of inshore fishing gear (beach seine, gillnet, purse seine, benthic longline, trawl, etc.), its marketability, and the generally intense and unregulated nature of inshore fisheries across large parts of the species' range, pose significant risks to the global population of this ray. The species is probably widely utilized across its range (Compagno and Last 1999) due to its availability to fisheries.<br/><br/>There are a few parts of its range where this eagle ray faces lower levels of threat, including the Maldives (where the exportation of ray product is banned), Australia, and parts of Oceania where human populations are low.<br/><br/>The Ocellated Eagle Ray occurs in coastal inshore waters where fishing pressure is typically very heavy, especially in Southeast Asian waters. The strong swimming nature of this species makes it quite susceptible to a range of fisheries, especially inshore gill net fisheries, which are extremely intensive in some regions (for example, Kalimantan, Indonesia). The species also enters estuarine waters where fishing pressure is extremely high and where (in Southeast Asia at least) pollution is also a major factor for all marine life.<br/><br/>This ray is likely to contribute substantially to numerous inshore artisanal fisheries across its range and regular landing sites are known. In Southeast Asia, the Ocellated Eagle Ray is landed in most countries within its range including: Indonesia (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010), Thailand (Vidthayanon 2002, Krajangdara 2014), the Philippines (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005), Taiwan (Schluessel <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Malaysia (Manjaji 2002, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Indonesia this eagle ray is commonly taken by demersal tangle net, bottom trawl, inshore gillnet, and to a lesser extent, demersal longline (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). These are all countries where fishing pressure on the inshore environment is intense and generally unregulated.<br/><br/>Extensive trawling in the Arafura Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2005) and in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009) is likely to affect eagle rays in these regions. Documented large declines in shark and ray catches associated with corresponding increases in fishing effort in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009) are likely to have a large effect on eagle rays in Indonesian waters and may be representative of fishing effects across the region.<br/><br/>In Australian waters eagle rays contribute to bycatch and byproduct in the East Coast Inshore Fin Fish fishery (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011), and bycatch in the Pilbara Trawl fishery (Western Australian Department of Fisheries 2010). Eagle rays contribute to the minor catch in the ‘Other Sharks and Rays’ category by purse seine and longline in the Tuna Fisheries of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (Oceanic Fisheries Program 2010).<br/><br/>A prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea; the fishery is managed under national laws and regulations, and there are some seasonal closures in place. While bycatch reduction devices are not currently in place, there are plans to implement these in the near future (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm. 2015). Detailed species composition data for the bycatch is currently being investigated (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm. 2015), however the Ocellated Eagle Ray is caught in low numbers.<br/><br/>Pressure on the inshore environment through artisanal fishing activities in the Bay of Bengal is likely affecting this species. Landings are recorded from India (Theivasigamani and Subbiah 2014), Bangladesh (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014), and the Thailand Andaman Sea (Krajangdara 2014).<br/><br/>The Ocellated Eagle Ray is a popular public aquarium species and is collected for the marine aquarium trade. In some localities it is likely to be persecuted when considered a pest of mollusc aquaculture farms, as has occurred with other myliobatid species, for example, the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) (Gray <em>et al</em>. 1997) and annual culls on the Longheaded Eagle Ray (<em>A. flagellum</em>) (Yamaguchi <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>While there is some taxonomic uncertainty for this species in the Western Indian Ocean with molecular analyses separating samples from Qatar from the rest of the Indo-Pacific region (White et al. 2010), the following information from that region may relate to the Ocellated Eagle Ray or a conspecific.<br/><br/>Off eastern Africa, it is commonly caught by artisanal fishermen, in bottom set gillnets, trawls, and longlines in Tanzania (Bianchi 1985), by artisanal gillnet fisheries off northern Madagascar (Doukakis and Jonahson 2003), and by hook and line and harpoon off Somalia (Sommer <em>et al</em>. 1996). Eagle rays are also reported from fish markets in the Red Sea (Saudi Arabia; Spaet and Berumen 2015), the Persian Gulf (Iran; Paighambari and Daliri 2012) and Oman (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>In South Africa, between 1981 and 2000 there was a non-significant increasing trend in catch of this eagle ray in the protective shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal (Young 2001). Of the mean annual catch of 16 animals, 82% were released alive. This species contributed 4.6% to the total batoid catch. It is also taken in small numbers as bycatch in a shallow water prawn trawl fishery that operates off central KwaZulu-Natal (Fennessy 1994).","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">There is limited information on the population demography and structure of the Ocellated Eagle Ray<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">.

It is likely caught for their dorsal skin as well (Roy 2010). The species is also collected for the marine aquarium trade.",Marine,"Fisheries taking the Ocellated Eagle Ray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species' range. Attempts to monitor and regulate fisheries in these regions would greatly improve conservation of this and other chondrichthyans. Monitoring (including species-specific catch details) of any directed elasmobranch landings and bycatch are necessary to provide valuable information on the population status of these rays. Fishery-independent surveys of this and other elasmobranchs are necessary to provide estimates of abundance and biomass.<br/><br/>Of highest priority is the resolution of taxonomic issues to better define the actual ranges of the various forms/species within the 'spotted eagle ray' species-complex.<br/><br/>The species is afforded protection on the east coast of Australia in the extensive Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (although only a third of the park is closed to commercial fishing) and the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in prawn trawl fisheries across northern Australia is mandatory. TEDs are likely to decrease the catch of at least large individuals, as was shown for numerous batoid species by Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. (2002). The spiritual significance of these rays to some indigenous communities has limited traditional catches in parts of northern Australia (Puruntatameri <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In the Maldives, the species is afforded protection in marine reserves created around diving sites in recognition of the high value of sharks and rays to tourism (Anderson and Waheed 2001). The Maldives also banned the export of rays in 1995 and the export of ray skins in 1996. Again, this was to protect the tourism resource (Anderson and Waheed 2001).<br/><br/>A recent reduction in the number of protective shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, will help to limit catches in that region. The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one/species/person/day for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes eagle rays.","",,false,false,Global

It is one of the slowest growing members of its genus (k = 0.062 per year) and estimated longevity ranges from 30 to 40 years and age at first maturity is about four years (Bustos <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;<span style="""">Based on a longevity of 30 to 40 years, age of first maturity of 4 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to range from 17 to 22 years.&#160;This species&#160;is a protogynous hermaphr</span>odite (Bustos <em>et al.</em> 2010).

These are thought to constitute spawning aggregations, but no direct evidence of spawning has been reported.<br/></p>","<p>Fishing, especially direct heavy targeting of aggregations on offshore reefs, is a potential major threat to this species, especially in the Canary Islands and the Azores. However, the lack of information on the impact from this threat is poorly known elsewhere in its range (Diogo and Pereira 2013, Salz 2015). In addition, released individuals frequently experience mortality due to barotrauma (Bustos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>The relative abundance of this species varies across the archipelagos over which its population is spread; it tends to be naturally rarer in the northern parts of its range (Afonso 2002).

Of the three grouper species that occur in the Azores (the northernmost island area), this is one of the less&#160;common ones, where it had an average 7.5% occurrence in underwater surveys and abundances around one order of magnitude below that in the Canary Islands (0.10 ± 0.40 ind./250 m², ~ 0.04 ind./100 m², N=520 transects) (M. Schmiing and P. Afonso pers. comm. 2014). Madeira (9.7%, N= 72 transects) and the Selvagens islands (15.5%, N=58 transects) appear to be in the middle range of these figures (E. Gonçalves and A. Friedlander pers. comm. 2016). This species was absent to frequently detected in occasional underwater and bottom longline surveys on offshore reefs and island shelves of the Cape Verde archipelago (Monteiro <em>et al</em>. 2008, G. Menezes and E. Giacomello pers. comm. 2016). The Canaries have a traditional targeted fishery for this species, while the Azores do not. Its small contribution to recent fisheries landings is consistent with other abundance information, suggesting that this is generally a rare species.<br/><br/>Fisheries catch and effort data for this species are limited or absent, especially for Madeira and the Cabo Verde [Cape Verde] Islands. The available&#160;commercial and artisanal catch data indicate that, in recent years, landings have been relatively small and currently are a very small component of the catch.&#160;Considering that spawning aggregations of this species are targeted, there is a high potential that it could be susceptible to overfishing. There are suspected localised extirpations of this species in intensively fished areas in the Canary Islands (Bas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). However, landings&#160;in the Canary Islands from 2006 to 2016 increased over time from about 4,000 kg in 2006 to 19,000 kg in 2016 (Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information).&#160;Underwater survey monitoring programs conducted in the Azores during the last two decades observed a reduction in abundance of this species in the southernmost island (Santa Maria) following an increase in commercial and recreational fishing, whereas abundance in the middle (Faial) and northernmost (Corvo) islands increased slightly inside marine protected areas. An overall decline in the numbers and individual size was observed at multiple aggregation sites, including Baixa do Norte (few individuals), Baixa dos badejos (multiple small individuals) and Baixa do Pinheiro (previously large, now multiple small individuals) around Santa Maria island; and also, Ilhéus dos Mosteiros (S. Miguel, adults now very rare); Ilhéu da Mina (Terceira, adults now very rare); Baixa de Castelo Branco (former larger aggregation know in the archipelago now extirpated) and Baixa do Norte (a few individuals including some adults) in Faial (J.P. Barreiros and P. Afonso pers. comm. 2016). In addition, total landings of 'mero' in the Azores have declined by 66% over 15 years from 70,240 kg in 1999 to 23,843 kg in 2014.</p><strong></strong>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the eastern Atlantic from the four offshore island archipelagos of Macaronesia: the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Cabo Verde Islands [Cape Verde Islands] (Heemstra and Anderson 2016). Its depth range is one to 100 metres, but mostly it occurs between 10 to 50 metres. Due to its preferred depth range and the surrounding volcanic island bathymetry, its habitat is typically confined to a narrow band within hundreds of meters from shore and a few offshore shallow reefs. The area within the generalized distribution polygon clipped to the zero to 50 metre isobath sourced from <a href=""https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/"">ETOPO1</a> is 6,191 km². According to data provided by P. Afonso (unpub. data 2016), the area within the 0-50 metre isobath across the Azores is about 686 km², but the ETOPO1 estimate in the same area is about 40% higher at 1,134 km². The data provided by P. Afonso is considered to be of a finer-scale resolution that were collected via multibeam echosounder surveys, and therefore is considered to be a better estimate than the ETOPO1 data. Similar fine resolution data are not available for the remaining three archipelagos (i.e., Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands), but are considered to be somewhat similar in geology to the Azores (i.e., all are volcanic in origin; F. Tuya pers. comm. 2016); therefore, we assume that the ETOPO1 data overestimates the 0-50 m isobath area, which reduces 6,191 to 3,714 km². In addition, P. Afonso estimates the area of rocky reef (the species' preferred habitat) within the 50 m isobath in the Azores to represent about 50% of the total area, which is 343 km². Applying the same assumption, 3,714 is reduced by 50% to 1,857 km²,&#160;which is the best estimate of area of occupancy (AOO) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The area within the minimum convex polygon drawn around the boundaries of its AOO, which is the best estimate of extent of occurrence (EOO), is about 2,512,729 km² (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information).&#160;Considering dispersal distance as the main barrier, each island group is one location, given that the distance between them (&gt;200 km) constitutes an ecological barrier for population connectivity.&#160;Therefore, the species is considered to be known from no more than nine locations: three locations in the Azores that correspond to the three island groups (1-3), Madeira (4), the Selvagens (5), two locations in the Canary Islands that correspond to the two island groups (6-7) and two locations in the Cape Verde Islands corresponding to the two island groups (8-9).</p>","<p>This species is commercially and recreationally fished throughout its range, and is a highly regarded food fish. It is commercially important in the Canary Islands, with smaller artisanal or subsistence/spearfishing fisheries in the remainder of its range. It is typically caught using lines, traps, and trammel nets, and is common in local fish markets.&#160;It is relatively easily captured by spearfishing and linefishing with live bait and by jigging.</p>",Marine,"<p>The only fishing regulations in place is a minimum catch size of 35 cm in the Canary Islands, but this is likely of little benefit. Several&#160;protected areas overlap the range and preferred habitat of this species: Monte da Guia, Ilhéu da Vila, Baixa da Pedrinha and Formigas bank in the Azores; Garajau and the south shore of Porto Santo in Madeira; Selvagen Islands; El Hierro, La Restinga or El Cabrón in the Canary Islands. These marine protected areas also include numerous EU Natura 2000 marine sites which are of priority for conservation within the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, most of these sites do not have management plans in place, and fishing is still permitted. Long-lining, gillnetting and spear-fishing are not allowed, but this species is frequently poached (Tuya&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Schmiing&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Its abundance inside marine protected areas in the Azores is higher than in fished areas (M. Schmiing and P. Afonso pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>The following actions are recommended: 1) MPAs include properly enforced and managed no-take areas in exposed reef habitats, 2) that such MPAs include spawning aggregation sites, or that these sites be protected by temporal closures, 3) targeted fishing of this species should either cease or be greatly reduced, and 4) further research be conducted on the population sizes and demographic trends of the species.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is listed as Vulnerable under A2bd. This species should be prioritized for fisheries management.","<em>Pentaneum quinquarius</em> is found on muddy bottoms in shallow coastal waters at depths of 10-70 m, and is also found in estuaries and lagoons. It is considered a marine species accessory in estuaries (Simier<em> et al</em>. 2006). It feeds on crustaceans and small fishes. The sex composition of this species is 45% male, less than 0.01% hermaphrodite, and 55% female. Spawning occurs in all months, peaking in the dry season and almost ceasing during the rainy season in Nigerian waters. The species reaches sexual maturity at less than six months of age, at about 150 mm TL. At three months, the species averages 100 mm TL, 175 mm at six months, and about 250 mm at one year (Motomura in pree).

The primary food items of this species included palaemonid shrimps and fishes, but, unlike other Polynemids which co-occurred&#160;with this species in Warri River, Nigeria, it did not include intertidal crabs. The absence of intertidal crabs may imply that <em>P. quinquarius</em> does not feed in the intertidal zone at high tide (Edema and Osagiede 2011).

Juveniles are found in seagrass beds or tidepools. As major predators of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, most polynemids feed on a variety of fishes and crustaceans. The pectoral fins of polynemids are divided into an upper part, with rays joined by membrane, and a lower part with four to 11 separate rays, which are thought to act as a sense organ to be used for searching for food in turbid waters. Most polynemids are protandrous. Information on &#160;the larval&#160;development&#160;of polynemids is minimal. Eggs are spherical and pelagic. Polynemids are commercially important in the eastern central Atlantic. The annual catch of polynemids from the area averaged about 39,000 tonnes in the period from 2000 to 2006.

In the North Atlantic, the western&#160;stock is experiencing fishing pressure above the target Fmsy, SSB is qualitatively evaluated as declining, and fishing mortality on younger ages has reached record high levels. The Saharo-Mauritanian stock (and landings) is estimated to have declined by more than 90% over the past 30 years (three generation lengths), due to fishing pressure and weak recruitment. In this portion of its range, catches have declined from an average of 15,000-20,000 metric tonnes per year in the mid 1980s to just 20 metric tonnes in the past three years (2009-2011).&#160;In 2010, this species was considered&#160;257% overexploited based on fishing mortality (F current/F 0.1) in the northern CECAF area. In the southern portion of this species range, from Guinea Bissau to Angola, the&#160;CECAF working group evaluates aggregated T<em>rachurus </em>species<em>, </em>the&#160;majority of which is comprised of&#160;<em>T. trecae</em>. Assuming no declines in the European portion of its range and greater than 90% declines in the Eastern Central Atlantic portion of its range, this species is estimated to have experienced at least a 35-40% decline over the past three generation lengths (30-35 years), and is listed as Vulnerable under A2bd.","This is a pelagic, oceanodromous species. It forms large schools in coastal areas with sandy substrate.  It feeds on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods. In the Adriatic Sea <em>T. trachurus</em> feeds mainly on crustaceans, cephalopods and fishes (Jardas <em>et al.</em> 2004). Juveniles of this species were caught in very shallow waters (&lt; 10 m depth) in the Ligurian Sea during November by means of purse seines (Tunesi <em>et al.</em> 2005). This species is divided into two stocks:  the West stock and North Sea stock.  The West stock spawns in a belt from the Biscay to Ireland in early spring, migrates north and eastwards to southern Norway and northern North Sea.  The North Sea stock spawns in the southern North Sea in summer, migrates to central North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat.  Females lays 140,000 eggs which hatch into 5 mm long larvae (Muus and Nielsen 1999).<br/><br/>This schooling species is found frequently over sandy bottom localities at 100 to 200 m depth, but may occur in deeper water (to about 500 m). It is also pelagic and near surface at times. The young sometimes seek shelter under jellyfishes and often occur with shoals of juvenile herrings. Juveniles and adults feed on a wide variety of pelagic and even benthic fishes, crustaceans and squids. It occurs mainly on the continental shelf (Smith-Vaniz in press). It has a maximum abundance of eggs off Mauritania from November to January, and <em>T. trecae</em> off Mauritania is from June to August (Arkaipov 2009).<br/><br/>This species has a maximum age of 24 years in South Africa (Hecht 1990) and 40 years in the Northeast Atlantic (Abaunza <em>et al.</em> 2003). The age at first breeding is two to four years for females. Current longevity under exploitation in the CECAF region is estimated to be eight years (CECAF 2011). For example, in Senegal, Mauritania and Gambia individuals are caught and aged only up to seven years (Camara pers. comm. 2013) in depths at around 100 m. In Mauritania, juveniles are taken at 200-300 m and larger individuals caught in shallower depths by commercial pelagic trawls (&lt; 100 m) (Camara pers. comm. 2013). In Ghana, smaller individuals were observed at Elmina Fish Market (Smith-Vaniz pers. comm. 2013). It is important to note&#160;that age and growth variation are present in this species' wide distribution and varying exploitation levels will likely have an effect on age and growth rates (Smith-Vaniz pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>Based on a historical longevity of 24-40 years, and age of first maturity of two to four years, generation length is conservatively estimated to be between 11 and 18 years. However, given the geographical variation of age estimates (greater longevity in colder waters in the northern parts of its range), the lower age estimate of approximately 11-12 years is recommended, with three generations estimated to be between 30-35 years.","This is a species with high commercial importance. It is caught with trawls and seines. FAO (2003) reported that in the southern part of the Alboran Sea the stock status of <em>T. trachurus</em> was fully exploited.  In the Mediterranean Sea it is caught mostly by purse seine and bottom trawl but also by hand line. This species is also targeted by the recreational fishery.&#160;According to an assessment review by FAO (2005) this species is fully exploited in the Mediterranean and is also heavily exploited in the Black Sea. This species is imported and is considered a highly-prized species in many West African countries. Due to high demand, it is imported from Mauritania. Beach seine captures smaller-sized species (Nunoo and Quartey pers. comm. 2013). In Senegal, this species is caught in very small quantities and there are no data available. It represents not even one percent of the total catch in scientific surveys (Sylla pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>Stocks of&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>, and of fishes of the genus&#160;<em>Trachurus</em>, are particularly difficult to assess. Ageing is difficult (Abaunza <em>et al. </em>2003). Additionally, several stocks, such as the western horse mackerel stock, are characterized by spasmodic recruitment, that is, good recruitment only once in a generation. Additionally, <em>T. trachurus</em>, like other members of the genus, is likely an indeterminate spawner and therefore total fecundity is unknown. The strength of a year class cannot be confirmed before it is fully recruited to the fishery and has reached the age of five years. The only fishery-independent data available are based on triennial egg surveys. For these reasons, recommended Total Allowable Catches (TAC) are advised to remain conservative (Roel and De Oliveira 2007). It has been suggested that management of small pelagics by effort control alone may not control the exploitation rate. This species is not subject to TAC restrictions in the Mediterranean (STECF advice 2013).","Globally reported catches of this species have remained relatively stable or increasing over the past 30-35 years, with an average of over 55,000,000 metric tonnes in the early 1980s (1981-1983) to an average of 68,000,000 tonnes (2011-2013). Drastic reductions in catch were seen in the late 1980s, from 8,000,000 tonnes to about 160,000 tonnes, which were likely due to changes in regulations, as well as better disaggregated reporting for this species (FAO FishStat 2015). &#160;<br/><br/><strong>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic,&#160;<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;is divided into three stocks, in order of decreasing biomass: the northwestern horse mackerel in the Norwegian sea, northern North Sea, west and south of the British Isles, western English Channel, and west of France; the southern horse mackerel around the Iberian peninsula; and the North Sea horse mackerel, restricted to the central and southern parts of the North Sea and eastern English Channel (Abaunza&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003). The status of the&#160;<em>T. trachurus&#160;</em>stock in the North Sea is unknown. Landings have been decreasing in the North Sea, however this is likely due to reductions in fishing effort. In division IXa this species is caught in mixed fisheries, and fishing pressure has on average been below Fmsy. However, Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) has decreased gradually since 2007 and is at around 30% below the long term average.&#160;There is no stock assessment information available from Madeira or the Canary Islands. For the Western Stock, which is the largest stock in the North Atlantic, SSB has varied between 0.65 and 1.7 million tonnes between 1995 and 2012 and was estimated to be at 0.84 million tonnes in 2013 (ICES Advice 2013). The western&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;stock (ICES divisions IIa, Iva, Vb, Via, VIIa-c, e-k, and VIIIa-e)&#160;is experiencing fishing pressure which is above the target Fmsy, and SSB is qualitatively evaluated as declining. Fishing mortality on younger ages has reached record high levels (Casey <em>et. al. </em>2014). In the Mediterranean, FAO statistics for this species are incomplete as they are most probably mixed with <em>T. mediterraneus</em>. In the Mediterranean, the bulk of the catches come from Turkey, the Sea of Marmara and western Black Sea.  The landings appear to be stable in the Mediterranean Sea. In Turkey, however, it is overfished as evidenced by only younger age classes appearing in the catch (zero to one year age class; C. Bizsel pers. comm. 2007).&#160;<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;in the southern Alboran Sea has no available SSB estimates, and no reference points, however landing restrictions as a more effective management tool for small pelagics in the Mediterranean have been proposed (Casey <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><strong><br/>Eastern Central Atlantic</strong><br/>Overall reported captures for this species in the Eastern Central Atlantic reached a high of 550,000 tonnes in 1995, and have since declined to approximately 200,000 tonnes in 2010 (FAO Fishfinder, Species Datasheet). However, <em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;is considered overexploited (CECAF 2011) from Senegal and northwards, and&#160;Mauritania stock assessments indicate overexploitation. From 1958 to 1990, overall catches in the Eastern Central Atlantic are&#160;fluctuating with two recorded peaks: in 1981 (22,790 metric tonnes) and 1987 (20,964 metric tonnes). However, catch records from 1991-2011 show very low reports (some reporting zero catches). and average catches in the Eastern Central Atlantic over the last nine years have been very low, dropping from averages of 700 metric tonnes/year in 1999-2001 to only 20 metric tonnes in 2007-2011. It is assumed that effort for this species has not decreased over this time period. Overall, in this portion of its range, catches have declined by more than 90%, from an average of 15,000-20,000 metric tonnes per year in the mid 1980s to just 20 metric tonnes in the past three years (2009-2011) over the past three generation lengths (or 30 years).&#160;In 2010, it was considered&#160;257% overexploited based on fishing mortality (F current/F 0.1; CECAF northern working group 2011).&#160;In this region, the Saharo-Mauritanian stock size has substantially decreased &#160;due to fishing pressure and weak recruitment (Abaunza&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>In the ECA, there is no confusion in terms of taxonomic identification between <em>T. trachurus </em>and <em>T. trecae</em>, however, in the region, catch of the two species are often lumped in mixed catches. However, in general,&#160;<em>T. trecae</em>&#160;is more abundant from Mauritania south and&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;is considered a more European species and is more abundant in the northern part of its range. In the southern portion of this species range, from Guinea Bissau to Angola, the&#160;CECAF working group evaluates T<em>rachurus </em>species and it is estimated that the majority of the catch is comprised of&#160;<em>T. trecae</em>.<br/><br/>Karaiskou<em>&#160;et al. </em>(2004) examined the population structure of&#160;<em>T. picturatus, T. mediterraneus</em> and&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;using mitochondrial control region. They found no sign of Atlantic-Mediterranean division in any of species, which was attributed to the ability of&#160;<em>Trachurus&#160;</em>species to migrate long distances, and to flexibility to oceanographical constraints. Allozyme analysis showed that of all&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em> subpopulations studied from across this species' known range were genetically homogeneous, connected by high levels of gene flow. There was only slight differentiation between eastern and western Mediterranean samples versus the western Mediterranean and Atlantic samples. Additionally, genetic variability in this species was found to be very high, among the highest recorded in the literature for many pelagic and demersal species, and the genetic structure was found to be stable over time. It is worth noting that the lowest levels of genetic variability were found in the heavily-exploited northwestern stock, corroborating information seen ICES analytical assessments of the stock (Cimmaruta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).",Decreasing,"<em>Trachurus trachurus</em> is found in the north and eastern Atlantic (Smith-Vaniz 1986), including the Mediterranean and Marmara Seas (Smith-Vaniz 1986) and the Black Sea. It occurs from Norway to South Africa, around the coast to Maputo (Mozambique; Smith-Vaniz in press).&#160;This species is known in Cape Verde but is likely a vagrant (Monteiro pers. comm. 2013). In the Mediterranean Sea the catches of&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;are much smaller than in Atlantic waters, particularly in north African Atlantic waters where an important horse mackerel fishery appears to take place (FAO 1995).&#160;In Senegal, there is a confusion in change of colouration at different depths, and&#160;<em>Trachurus trecae</em>&#160;is more common than&#160;<em>T. trachurus</em>&#160;(Sagna pers. comm. 2013) and is more important commercially in Senegal (Sagna pers. comm. 2013). It is found from zero to 1,050 m depth.","This is a species with high commercial importance. It is utilized fresh, smoked, canned and frozen, and can  be fried, broiled and baked (Frimodt 1995). This species is also targeted by the recreational fishery.",Marine,"<em>Trachurus trachurus</em>&#160;is a commercially important species which is managed to varying degrees throughout its range. Management efforts in the Mediterranean are perceived as being somewhat less effective overall. It has been suggested that the management of this species through effort control alone may not be effective in the Mediterranean, and that catch limits are a more effective means of managing this species. The EU minimum size 15 cm TL. Turkey has a closed season from the end of April to the beginning of September and also minimum size limit of 13 cm TL (STECF 2014). This species is overexploited in Mauritania with a recommendation to cut the effort (Camara pers. comm. 2013).","",,false,false,Global

Considering this species' susceptibility to overfishing, it has likely experienced similar declines elsewhere in areas with heavy grouper fishing effort (e.g., Central America). Therefore, global-level declines of at least 30% or more are suspected to have occurred over the past two generation lengths (40 years), and due to insufficient conservation measures in most of its range, this decline is expected to continue over the next generation length. It is listed as Vulnerable A2bd+4bd with a strong recommendation to improve fisheries monitoring and management, continue rebuilding efforts in the U.S. Atlantic and reduce fishing effort in Brazil.","Adults of this species inhabit&#160;offshore rocky bottoms from 30 to 525 m depth, but are most abundant between 100 and 200 m. Juveniles may be found inshore in shallow waters (Heemstra and Randall 1993).&#160;This species lives and spawns in very restricted areas on hard structures, particularly on the shelf-edge (Sedberry <em>et al.</em> 2006). Adults primarily consume fish, gastropods, cephalopods, and brachyuran crustaceans (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Its maximum total length is 122 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It has been aged to 29 years in the U.S. South Atlantic (Wyanski <em>et al.</em> 1999) and to 46.4 and 54 years in Brazil&#160;(Ximenes-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 1999, Costa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). This species is a&#160;protogynous hermaphrodite (SEDAR36 2013) that may form aggregations during spawning season (Moore and Labisky 1984, Wyanski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Females reach sexual maturity by age 3–5 between 45.1-57.5 cm total length and sexual transition occurs within 3–4 years after the females reach sexual maturity (Moore and Labisky 1984, Wyanski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). According to data presented in the most recent U.S. Atlantic stock assessment, natural mortality was 0.12, age at 50% female maturity was estimated to be 5.6 years, age at 50% transition was estimated to be 17 years and the oldest individual was 35 years (SEDAR36 2013). Based on a longevity of 35 years, age of first maturity of 5 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood&#160;(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 20 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species, and rapid declines have been documented after heavy exploitation (Wyanski <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Arena&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Trawls operating at 25-45 m depth poses a threat to juvenile survival (Moore and Labisky 1984).","This deep-water grouper is more abundant in continental areas, and is therefore, naturally uncommon in the insular Caribbean region. According to landings and catch per unit effort data and stock assessment biomass models, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% over the past two generation lengths, a period of 40 years. This decline is expected to continue over the next generation length (20 years) due to insufficient conservation measures in most of its range.<br/><br/><strong>U.S. South Atlantic: </strong>A fishery-independent trap and bottom longline&#160;survey conducted on the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf and edge from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to St. Lucie, Florida from 1996-2011 reported the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species as variable; increasing between 1996‐2002, decreasing from 2002-2008, and then slightly increasing since 2008. A similar survey conducted in the same area, but using bottom longline, reported a variable CPUE over the time period, with a general increase from 1996 through 2009, and a possible decrease in more recent years (Ballenger and Smart 2013). From June 1985 to April 1986, 21 trips by two vessels fishing at depths of 137-194 m off Onslow Bay, North Carolina captured 1,094 fish, 92% of which were individuals of this species. By early August 1985, it was estimated that over 60% of the exploitable biomass has been removed, and within the year, over 80% had been removed (Epperly and Dodrill 1995). Wyanski <em>et al.</em> (1999) suggested that the population of this species was overfished in North and South Carolina due to the relatively high proportion (56%) of immature females&#160;in the catch in 1993-1994,&#160;the proportion of males declined from 7-23% in the 1970s and 1980s to 1% in the 1990s, and the&#160;mean length of fish landed in the longline fishery had steadily declined from 65 to 80 cm total length in the early 1980s to 50 to 60 cm in the mid-1990s.<em>&#160;</em>Commercial landings in the Atlantic states appeared in official statistics in 1981, peaked in 1990 at 255 metric tonnes and declined thereafter to 61 mt in 2016, which represents a 76% decline over the past 26 years (NMFS database <a href=""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). The first stock assessment for the U.S. Atlantic was conducted in 2004, and concluded that overfishing began in the mid-1970s and continued through at least 2002 (SEDAR4 2004). The next stock assessment, which was published in 2013, concluded that spawning stock had declined until the mid-1990s and then increased gradually over the last decade, but that the stock remains overfished. However, fishing mortality declined to a level where overfishing is no longer occurring, and at the current fishing mortality, the stock is projected to recover within the rebuilding time frame (SEDAR36 2013). Overall, total biomass in the U.S. Atlantic declined by 59% from 1976-2013 (37 years) and spawning stock biomass declined by 75% from 1974-2012 (38 years; SEDAR36 2013).<br/><strong><br/>Gulf of Mexico:</strong>&#160;This species is more common within the Madison-Swanson Marine Reserve than in other shelf-edge habitats of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Koenig and Coleman 2013). According to NMFS, the annual recreational harvest in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico estimates of both number (N) and weight of&#160;<em>H. niveatus</em>&#160;averaged 7,619 fish and 15,641 kg in 1996 to 2005. Landings peaked at 87,298 fish and 280,263 kg in 1981. [Note: there are very large proportional standard errors (PSE) associated with the annual estimates of landings, which suggest these are rare-event landings in the recreational fisheries of the Gulf of Mexico] (T. Sminskey pers. comm. 2006). Commercial landings in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico states appeared in official statistics in 1985, and have fluctuated between about 65-110 mt since 1986 with no overall trend (NMFS database <a href=""https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index"">https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/commercial-fisheries/commercial-landings/annual-landings/index</a> accessed March 2018). No formal stock assessment is available for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.&#160;In the southern Gulf of Mexico, off the northern coast of the Mexican Yucatan Peninsula, there is not any official record of the species. It is possible that this species is pooled with catches of <em>Epinephelus itajara</em> due to the relative similarity between them (A. Aguilar-Perera pers. obs). In Mexico, landings for this species are estimated to be less than 1% of the mixed-grouper and snapper catch. In Cuba, this species is rare in the fishery because it is found in deeper waters.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil:&#160;</strong>From 1986 to 1995, <em>H. niveatus</em> comprised 9.9% of the total catch by bottom line fisheries (201-650 m) in southeast Brazil (Paiva and Garcez 1998). Among the species observed in the industrial landings in south Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul), from 1989-1999, <em>H. niveatus</em> (cherne-verdadeiro) was captured frequently during the 1990s, but was never abundant (1 to 30 individuals per boat; M. Brick pers. comm). In São Paulo (southeast Brazil) catch was 8.45 t in 1999, 5.38 t in 2000, 0.37 t in 2001, 0.51 t in 2003, 0.34 t in 2004 and 0.32 t in 2005, which represents a 96% decline over 6 years (Instituto de Pesca 2006). In Santa Catarina in southeast Brazil, total catch abruptly declined from 14 mt in 2002 to 0.5 mt in 2004, increased to 7.7 mt in 2006 and declined thereafter to 1.1 mt in 2012, and overall, from 2002-2012 there was a 91% decline in landings and 64% decline in catch per unit effort (UNIVALI/CTTMar 2013).&#160;In areas where it has been fished beyond economic viability, recovery has been slow.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is distributed in the western Atlantic from Virginia south along the U.S. Atlantic, Bermuda, throughout the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea from Haiti, Puerto Rico to Saba Atoll, and along Central and South America from Mexico to Puerto Piramides, Nuevo Gulf, Argentina (Heemstra and Randall 1993,&#160;Trobbiani <em>et al</em>. 2013, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). In Brazil, it occurs off Rio Grande do Norte (Júnior <em>et al.</em> 2015), São Paolo State (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2014) and on rocky reef&#160;off Santa Catarina (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Its depth range is 10-525 metres.","This species is taken by commercial fisheries in the U.S., on the Honduras/Nicaraguan shelf, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela with hook-and-line, bottom longlines, traps and trawls (Heemstra and Randall 1993).",Marine,"In the U.S., this species has been monitored and fishery management measures have been in place since the early 1990s that include commercial quotas and trip limits and recreational daily bag limits (SAFMC 2005). Recommendations for population recovery include increasing protection for males and reduce capture of juvenile/immature individuals (Moore and Labisky 1984, Wyanski <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). There is strong evidence from the Madison-Swanson Marine Reserve that no-take zones in shelf-edge habitats protect deep-water species such as this (Koenig and Coleman 2013). Further research on its protogynous life history as well as fishery independent population studies are needed (SEDAR36 2013).","",,false,false,Global
46910927,14050,Mycteroperca microlepis,Vulnerable,A4bd,2018,2016-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has a widely disjunct distribution, with two main subpopulations: one in the U.S. South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, and a second in southern Brazil. Adults inhabit hard-bottom substrates, mainly along continental shelf areas, and juveniles inhabit inshore areas, especially seagrass beds. It is relatively long-lived and a protogynous hermaphrodite that forms seasonal spawning aggregations.<br/><br/>The species is heavily exploited by recreational and commercial fisheries throughout its range, including direct targeting of spawning aggregations. As a result of overfishing, spawning aggregations have been greatly reduced or no longer form in some areas and adult sex ratios have become highly female-biased in most areas. U.S. fisheries stock assessments for the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic present models of biomass and catch per unit effort (CPUE); however, given that catches of this species were lumped with other groupers prior to the mid-1980s, and possibly more recently, there is substantial uncertainty in interpreting population trends from these data previous to 2005. However, it is recognized that significant declines have occurred in U.S. waters over at least the past two generation lengths. For the purposes of this Red List assessment, we choose to utilize U.S. commercial landings, which declined despite constant effort by about 72% from 2005-2015 in the Gulf of Mexico&#160;and&#160;by 39% from 2009 to 2015 in the South Atlantic.&#160;Long-term species-specific fisheries data are not available from Mexico, but CPUE in the large-scale Campeche Bank grouper fishery declined by 51% from 1984-2012, or 28 years. Fisheries data are also limited in Brazil; however, catches since 2011 and anecdotal fisher reports from 1980-2008 indicate declines of up to 70% have also occurred there.<br/><br/>In U.S. waters, several conservation measures, including stock assessments, fishing regulation and protection of several spawning sites, have allowed for some reduction in fishing mortality; however, a continued low level of males in the population and suspected continued declines in spawning biomass has prevented recovery. Fishing regulations in Mexico and Brazil are not known to be effective enough to prevent further declines in this species.<span style="""">&#160;Therefore, the global population of this species is estimated to have declined by 30-60% over the past two generation lengths (34 years), and&#160;this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (17 years) due to no anticipated changes in exploitation rates or management efforts. Considering the uncertainty in the data, it is conservatively listed as Vulnerable A4bd.&#160;Additional speci</span>es-specific&#160;information is needed for Mexican and Brazilian grouper fisheries, as well as improvements in fisheries management and monitoring. Further establishment and effective enforcement of protected areas on spawning aggregation sites is recommended.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This reef-associated species is usually found offshore on rocky bottoms and occasionally inshore on rocky or grassy bottoms. Overall, the species prefers habitats characterized by maximum structural complexity, such as living&#160;<em>Oculina</em>&#160;coral reefs, at depths between 70-100 m (McGovern<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1998,&#160;Koenig&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). Adults are either solitary or in groups of 5 to 50 individuals.&#160;Juveniles primarily inhabit seagrass beds (Ross and Moser 1995, Koenig and Coleman 1996, Switzer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). In areas where seagrass is virtually absent, such as South Carolina, high-salinity oyster reefs and other shallow estuarine structure&#160;provide juvenile habitat (Mullaney and Gale 1996, Mullaney pers. comm). In the southern Gulf of Mexico, juvenile females are caught inshore at depths of 1-10 m, and adult females and males and transitionals are caught offshore at depths of 33 to 167 m (Koenig<em> et al.</em> 1993, Brule <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/>The species primarily consumes fish, some crabs, shrimps and cephalopods (Naughton and Saloman 1985, Mullaney 1993, Stallings <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brulé <em>et al. </em>2011). According to tagging studies, this species is capable of conducting movements of hundreds of kilometres (e.g., from South Carolina to the northeast Gulf of Mexico; Van Sant <em>et al.</em> 1994, Collins <em>et al.</em> 1996, Heinisch and Fable 1999, McGovern <em>et al.</em> 2005, Lindberg<em> et al.</em> 2006). This species spawns exclusively on shelf-edge reefs, preferably on rocky ridges next to drop-offs (Koenig <em>et al.</em> 1996, Koenig and Coleman 2011). Previously unexploited spawning aggregations of <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em> and <em>M. phenax </em>comprised of hundreds of individuals&#160;were observed in 1980 by Gilmore and Jones (1992) during manned submersible dives in the Oculina Banks off Ft. Pierce, Florida. Males remain near spawning sites in deep water year-round (Collins <em>et al</em>. 1987, McGovern <em>et al</em>. 1998, Koenig and Coleman 2011).&#160;In December and January, females form pre-spawning aggregations in shallower areas prior to migrating to the spawning aggregation sites in deeper water (Koenig and Coleman 2011). It forms multiple small spawning aggregations (20-50 individuals) in February through mid-April on the shelf edge (50-120 m) in the southeastern U.S. (McGovern <em>et al</em>. 1998, Koenig and Coleman 2011). On the Campeche Bank off Mexico, it primarily spawns between January and March (Brule&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Jue&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite and a multiple (batch) spawner with indeterminate fecundity (McErlean and Smith 1964, Collins <em>et al.</em> 1997, Trejo-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Females reach maturity between 3-6 years of age around fork lengths of 70.5-72.1 cm (Hood and Schlieder 1992, Heemstra and Randall 1993, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2003). Sex transition occurs between 75-111&#160;cm total length at 5-9 years of age (Collins<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1997, Brulé <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;Maximum ages have been reported as 17 years by Hood and Schlieder (1992), 20 years by Collins <em>et al</em>. (1987), 26 years by Harris and Collins (2000) and 31 years by Lombardi <em>et al.</em> (2013). Its maximum total length is 145 cm. Natural mortality is estimated as 0.14 (SEDAR10 2014). Based on a longevity of 31 years, age at first maturity of 3 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 17 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species. It is particularly susceptible to overfishing due to certain intrinsic life history characteristics that include protogyny, slow growth, late age at maturity and&#160;aggregating behaviour (Ault <em>et al</em>. 1998, Huntsman <em>et al</em>. 1999). Due to their predictability in space and time, spawning aggregations are easily accessed and repeatedly fished (McGovern <em>et al</em>. 1998). It is easily captured year-round due to advanced GPS positioning of fishing gear over reef aggregations. It also suffers high rates of mortality from the effects of barotrauma. The dramatic decline in the proportion of males in spawning aggregations is of concern regarding sperm limitation, disruption of sex change processes and inbreeding (Coleman<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1996,&#160;Chapman<em>&#160;et al</em>. 1999,&#160;Koenig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Koenig and Coleman 2011). Other threats include juvenile seagrass/estuarine habitat degradation due to pollution, coastal development and extreme red tide events (Renán <em>et al</em>. 2004, Koenig and Coleman 2012, Nelson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Extensive <em>Oculina </em>habitat destruction in the Oculina Banks, primarily due to illegal shrimp trawling, drastically reduced the quality of this area for reef fish habitat and spawning (Koenig <em>et al.</em> 2005, Reed <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although the <em>Oculina</em> coral habitat has been destroyed in over 90% of the reserve (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2007), this species may still spawn there.","<p>This species is, or was, a naturally fairly common species on hard-bottom and rocky ledges throughout its range. Its global population is comprised of two widely-separated subpopulations: one in the U.S. South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico and the other in southern Brazil. Tagging studies have shown extensive migrations of adults from South Carolina reefs to shelf-edge reefs of northwest Florida in the Gulf of Mexico (McGovern <em>et al.</em> 2005). Molecular studies also indicate that U.S. South Atlantic and eastern Gulf of Mexico stocks are connected (Cushman<em> et al</em>. 2009). Larval dispersal occurs across the entire West Florida Shelf and genetic evidence indicate there is some level of connectivity between populations on the Campeche Bank and the West Florida Shelf (Jue 2010, Jue<em> et al</em>. 2015). Genetics substructure in the Campeche Bank stock may act as a source for a mixed population on the West Florida Shelf (Renán<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>According to various types of fisheries data, including landings, catch per unit effort (CPUE), modelled total and spawning stock biomass, and anecdotal reports from fishers, this species is estimated to have declined on a global-level by an average of 30-60% since the 1980s, or over the past two generation lengths (about 34 years). Due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure, this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next generation length (17 years). Other evidence that supports the occurrence of serious declines includes the reduction and/or extirpation of spawning aggregations, highly female-skewed sex ratios, frequent take of juveniles (e.g., Mexico) and declines in body size and age at first maturity (see following discussion).</p><strong>U.S. Gulf of Mexico: </strong>This species is most abundant in the northeast Gulf of Mexico off Florida and is the second most common grouper taken in commercial fisheries in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico besides <em>Epinephelus morio</em> (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Abundance of this species on shallow artificial reefs off Cedar Key, Florida in the Gulf of Mexico declined significantly between 2001-2008, regardless of habitat quality (Lindberg<em> et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Data collected from commercial fisheries on the Madison Ridge in the Gulf of Mexico, which is a historically important area for spawning aggregations of this species, reported severe declines in catch, extirpations of most aggregations and severely truncated age distributions prior to closure of Madison Swanson Reserve to fishing in 2000. After closure of the reserve, size and age of this and other species increased and spawning aggregations have been repopulated (Koenig and Coleman 2006 and 2011, SEDAR33 2014). The proportion of males was 1-2% higher inside the Madison Swanson Reserve after fishing was restricted in that area (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Although the commercial fishery catches larger fish (on average) than the recreational fishery, the recreational fishery once accounted for about 78% of the total number of individuals caught (Schirripa and Goodyear 1994). In 2002, the recreational fishery represented about 65% of the total catch of this species (Dayton <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;Commercial landings declined markedly after 2002-2003 with current landings continuing to be far below historic levels today. That decline is attributed to a combination of reduced management measures as well as mortality from a severe red tide event in 2005. According to a fisheries model that accounted for substantial declines in fishing mortality due to increasingly restrictive management regulations active since the 1990s, this species was expected to undergo a strong recovery after 2012 (SEDAR33 2014).&#160;However, the status of this species in the Gulf of Mexico is uncertain according to various updated model predictions. The most recent update of the SEDAR33 (2014) stock assessment published in 2016, applied two different models to estimate spawning stock biomass in the Gulf of Mexico, and the results from these contradicted each other. One model, referred therein as the Continuity model, concluded that the stock is not overfished and not undergoing overfishing. The second model, referred therein as the Alternative model, concluded that the stock is overfished with overfishing occurring. Both models have certain technical uncertainties associated with the data, but reports from recreational and commercial fishers that landings have not increased as of 2013, 2014 and 2015 despite continuous effort and management measures is a strong indication that the increase in abundance predicted by fisheries models in SEDAR33 (2014) has not been realized. In addition, the commercial CPUE index declined by 80-83% from about 2004-2009, and no data are presented for years following 2009, but catch has reportedly remained low (SEDAR33 2016 update). A commercial individual fishing quota (IFQ) system was initiated in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, which is where most of the landings for this species occur, but regardless of the increases in quota, the commercial fishery caught about the same mass of fish from 2010 to 2015. Commercial landings have declined by about 72%, from a high of about 800 mt in 2005 to a low of about 225 mt in 2010 and remained thereafter around 250 mt through 2015, and the fishery was not able to meet the quota for at least 6 years running now (SEDAR33 2016). A similar pattern of decline also occurred in all sectors of the Gulf of Mexico recreational fishery in recent years; the recreational fishery (numbers of fish) and the commercial fishery (gutted weight) both show the same decline in recent years (SEDAR33 2016). <br/><br/>The current official status of the species in the U.S. is considered not overfished with overfishing not occurring since fishing mortality in 2012 (the terminal year of the SEDAR33 2014 assessment) was below the threshold, and the projected fishing mortality in 2013 (based on landings for that year which were below the quota) was also below the overfishing threshold. However, authors of the SEDAR33 2016 update reported consistent overestimations of spawning stock biomass in previous assessments, and that the stock status may not have been as robust as previously concluded. Furthermore, this species was previously considered overfished for the majority of the time-series (1966-1999, 2002-2003, and 2006-2011) until it was no longer considered to be undergoing overfishing by about 2010 (SEDAR33 2016). The Alternative model, indicates that<span style=""""> spawning stock biomass declined by 58% from 1963-2015 (a period of 52 years); however,&#160;</span><span style="""">catch statistics for groupers were lumped prior to 1986 and fishers and fish house owners misidentified them as Black Grouper, when in fact, only a tiny fraction of the catch in the Gulf was Black Grouper</span>, which introduces significant uncertainty when identifying species-specific trends for that time period<span style="""">. Furthermore, the fishery for <em>Mycteroperca microlepis </em>was minor<em>&#160;</em>until increasing in the 1970s. The fishery statistics for the Gulf were improved by the 2000s, and the catch was increasing until 2005, but then started to decline particularly due to the low proportion of males and the continued commercial targeting of spawning aggregations&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">(C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018)</span><span style="""">.</span><span style="""">&#160;</span><span style="""">A likely contributing factor to the lack of recovery is the continued low numbers of males in the population due to effects from fishing selectivity for males during spawning season&#160;primarily by the commercial fishery (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Throughout its U.S. range, the proportion of males in this protogynous species has declined dramatically from 15-25% males in the 1970s to 1-5% in the 1990s and that the proportion remains low to the present (Koenig<em> et al</em>. 1993, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 1996, Coleman <em>et al</em>. 1996, McGovern <em>et al.</em> 1998, Burns and Robbins 2003, Ward and Brooks 2010). Another study suggested that size at first maturity had also declined (McGovern&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998).&#160;The effect of this extreme change in sex ratio and reduction of spawning aggregations undoubtedly decreases reproductive output, but the extent of the decrease or its overall effect on recruitment is not clear. According to a study on genetic diversity of this species on the West Florida Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, the estimated effective population size remains large (with some uncertainty) and that genetic drift should not be adversely affecting adaptive potential; however, the effective population size is in decline due to fishing pressure and the trend is predicted to continue (Jue<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;</span><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>U.S. South Atlantic:</strong>&#160;Landings of this species in the U.S. South Atlantic were first recorded in the 1960s, and in 1973, individuals landed from offshore waters in areas where spawning aggregations occur off North and South Carolina were almost always greater than 80 cm total length, but after 15 years of intensive fishing, almost no individuals larger than 80 cm were taken in the recreational fishery (Huntsman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Previously unexploited spawning aggregations of&#160;<em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. phenax</em>&#160;comprised of hundreds of individuals were observed in 1980 by Gilmore and Jones (1992) during manned submersible dives in the Oculina Banks off Ft. Pierce, Florida. Observations from subsequent manned submersible dives at this site by Koenig, Gilmore and Grimes during the spawning season in 1995 found no individuals of this species and only one small aggregation (eight individuals) of small&#160;<em>M. phenax</em>&#160;and the percentage composition of this species relative to all reef fishes on Jeff’s Reef declined from 4.8% in 1980 (n=4,375) to 0.07% in 1995 (n=1,399) (Koenig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000).<br/>The U.S. South Atlantic stock was first assessed in 2006 (SEDAR10), and at that time, the stock was not overfished but was undergoing overfishing. The most recent stock assessment update, SEDAR10 (2014), concluded the stock was not overfished but was undergoing overfishing (fishing mortality is too high). Spawning stock biomass declined until the mid-1980s and has since been relatively stable, with some increases in recent years; however, this biomass was projected to decline in the years immediately after 2012 due to poor recruitment events in 2010 and 2011. Over the entire time series (1962-2013), spawning stock biomass declined from about 4,500 mt in the early 1960s to 1,683 mt in 2013, which represents a 63% decline over 51 years. During that same time period, total biomass declined by 66% from about 8,200 mt in the early 1960s to 2,744 mt in 2013 (SEDAR10 2014).<span style="""">&#160;</span><span style="""">In addition, commercial CPUE declined by 30% from 2005-2011; however, similar to the Gulf of Mexico, catches of this species were also lumped with other groupers prior to the mid-1980s, and possibly even more recently, which introduces significant uncertainty to interpreting population trends from these biomass and CPUE models (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). The quota in the South Atlantic has limited commercial landings to around 300,000 lbs, but fishers have not been able to reach it in recent years even though the quota is set low relative to historical catches, also similar to the Gulf. For example, in 2017, landings in the South Atlantic were 57% of the quota, and overall, commercial landings declined by 39% from 442,760 lbs in 2009 to 268,191 lbs in 2015 (see <a href=""http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/acl_monitoring/commercial_sa/index.html"">http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/acl_monitoring/commercial_sa/index.html</a>).</span><span style=""""></span><span style=""""><br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>A survey conducted in northern Yucatan, Mexico from 2000-2001, captured 928 immature specimens of this species (Renán <em>et al</em>. 2004). At least 18 grouper species are exploited commercially in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets. The Mexican inshore artisanal or small-scale fishery targets juveniles, while the Mexican and Cuban offshore fishery mainly targets adults. The commercial fishery occurs mainly on the Campeche Bank off Yucatan (76%) with a smaller proportion off Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche and Tampico (SAGARPA 2012). The most important species by catch and weight for the inshore fishery is <em>Epinephelus morio</em>, followed by <em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em>. <em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em> is apparently a minor component of the Mexican grouper fishery, where it represents about 1-2% of the total finfish catch by the Mexican offshore Campeche Bank fishery (Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, F. Arreguin-Sanchez pers. comm. to C. Koenig). The Mexican grouper fishery is considered to be in an overall state of decline, and over the past 28 years (1984 to 2012), the average CPUE (kg per fishing trip) in the offshore fishery declined by 51% (SAGARPA 2012). The stock characteristics of <em>M. microlepis</em> remain largely unknown and landings, CPUE, catch composition and size trends from Mexican waters are scarce or not available (Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Yucatan, this species is recorded under the local name “abadejo” (Monroy <em>et al</em>. 2014, A. Aguilar pers. comm. 2016), but other Mexican states include other grouper species under the local name “abadejo”. Landings of “abadejo” in Yucatan, increased from 2 mt in 2006 to 36 mt in 2012 and then declined to 26 mt in 2014 (CONAPESCA <a href=""http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad"">http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad</a> accessed September 2016); however, confusion between <em>M. microlepis</em> and <em>M. bonaci</em> (and maybe other groupers) in “abadejo” landings render the validity of these data untenable. On the Campeche Bank from February 2007 to January 2008, immature females were frequently caught by both the Mexican inshore (96% of total catch) and offshore (21% of total catch) fleets (Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>This species is targeted by commercial hook and line, traps and longline fisheries that operate from Espirito Santo to Santa Catarina in Brazil. Data from official (unpublished) landings in Rio de Janeiro (FIPERJ), show a decline in catch per unit effort from 2011 a total of 3,432 kg captured in 26 landings, 648 kg in 11 landings in 2012, only a single landing with a total of 550 kg in 2013) and a single landing of 35 kg in 2014. Interviews with spearfishermen in Rio de Janeiro reported a 70% decline in catch of this species from 1980 to 2008 (28 year time period; B. Ferreira and Machado pers. comm).<strong><br/></strong></span>",Decreasing,"This species has a disjunct distribution in the&#160;western Atlantic from North Carolina south along the U.S., Bermuda, throughout the Gulf of Mexico except Cuba, and in southern Brazil from the State of Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina (Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It is rare in Bermuda and otherwise is not known from the Caribbean or northeastern Brazil. Juveniles have been recorded as far north as Massachusetts in the U.S. and one record from Cuba is likely a waif (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Its depth range is 0-167 metres.","This species is taken in commercial and recreational fisheries by handline, bottom longline and speargun. Spawning aggregations are targeted by fishers. Juveniles are often taken as bycatch in the bait-shrimp fishery that operates in seagrass beds (Schirripa and Goodyear 1994). Most of the Mexican commercial offshore grouper catch is exported to United States (SAGARPA 2012).",Marine,"<strong>Mexico: </strong>A seasonal closure of the grouper fishery from February 15 to March 15 has been in place since 2003 off Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure was extended from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Other regulations for the Mexican grouper fishery include limited number of commercial permits, use of circle hook types and minimum size limits (SAGARPA 2009, 2014a). It has been recommended to reduce fishing effort to levels in the 1980s (estimated at 320 vessels carrying an average of six trips a year for each fishing unit and with a duration of 15 days per trip) and reduce grouper fishing mortality by 20% within five years and conduct further species-specific research (SAGARPA 2012, 2014b). The level of effective enforcement of these regulations is not known.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>United States:&#160;</strong>In 1990, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council adopted a 20-inch minimum size, five-fish grouper bag limit for recreational fishers, and a commercial shallow-water quota of 9.8 million pounds (Schirripa and Goodyear 1994). In 2000, commercial and recreational minimum size limits were increased to 24 and 22 inches, sales of this species were prohibited from 15 February to 15 March and two marine reserves (Madison-Swanson and Steamboat Lumps)&#160;were established where fishing for reef fishes was prohibited year-round (Turner <em>et al.</em> 2001; http://www.gulfcouncil.org/oldstories/2002-03-26-Gag%20Status%20Change%20Requested.htm accessed February 2006). Further measures have been implemented in both reserves since then. The Madison Swanson Fishery Reserve, which is on the shelf edge of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, includes about 20 spawning aggregation sites of this species (Koenig and Coleman 2011).&#160;In Florida, the fishing season is restricted to 1 June to 31 December in Gulf waters and from 1 May to 31 December for Atlantic waters, and certain areas are closed to bottom fishing year-round (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2016). According to Boyan (2000), less than 2% of reported commercial catches occurred in the closed area, enforcement was insufficient to prevent illegal fishing, one-month closures failed to significantly reduce commercial landings since spawning aggregations continue for three months and the 24 inch size limit only reduced recreational and commercial take by 30-36% and 16%, respectively. Current regulations include a limited entry fishery where a limited number of commercial fishing permits is available, a seasonal closure during March and April to reduce the commercial catch and minimum size limits, quota with size limits for both commercial and recreational fisheries, bag limits for recreational fisheries, and limited gear restrictions (including elimination of traps, restricted areas for use of long-line gear required use of circle hooks for the hook and line fishery) (Koenig and Coleman 2012).&#160;The spawning site in the Oculina Banks is now part of a marine reserve established by the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council where fishing is prohibited year-round.&#160;Shelf-edge fishery reserves are necessary to manage the fishery for this species and ensure optimum reproductive capacity (Koenig <em>et al. </em>2000).<strong>&#160;</strong>Specimens collected inside the Madison-Swanson Reserve are older and larger with a lower female-biased sex ratio over those captured outside. Commercial fishing effort is relatively high in the areas surrounding the reserve, and there are direct indications that a spillover effect is occurring (Koenig and Coleman 2011).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Brazil: </strong>There is a minimum harvest size for this species in Brazilian waters (IBAMA 2003).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Research needed: </strong>Further research is needed on the behaviour, genetics and physiology of sex reversal, maturation and migration, timing and control of sex reversal, formation and nature of shallow pre-spawning aggregations, and movement of fish to and from spawning sites (Koenig and Coleman 2012). In addition, the geographic coverage of juvenile abundance indices should be expanded to evaluate recruitment success and predict trends in adult population size and to increase the accuracy of maps of juvenile habitat. More large (greater than 100 miles<sup>2</sup>) year-round closures of shelf-edge areas that encompass spawning sites of this species are needed to protect the male component of the population (Koenig and Coleman 2011). Considering fishers have generally not been able to meet the U.S. quota recently, may suggest that the quota is too high to be of conservation use.","",,false,false,Global

However, overfishing is occurring in approximately 40% of this species' global range, with estimated declines of at least 20% in the Western and Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific, and up to 40% in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean stocks over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Based stock declines estimated from trends in spawning biomass ratio, spawning stock biomass or B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and weighted by stock-size (MSY), there has been an estimated 29–32% decline globally of Bigeye Tuna over the past three generation lengths (approximately 1996 to 2018). Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable under Criterion A2.","This pelagic and oceanodromous species occurs in waters with temperatures ranging from 13 °C to 29 °C, but the optimum is between 17 °C and 22 °C. Variation in occurrence is closely related to seasonal and climatic changes in surface temperature and thermocline. Unassociated Bigeye tuna schools are typically found above the mixed layer depth during the night, and during the day they spend most of their time undertaking dives to 250-500 m for prolonged periods targeting deep scattering prey organisms. Schools of Bigeye associated with FADs are commonly found in aggregations with Skipjack tuna and sometimes Yellowfin tuna dependent on the area. When associated with FADs, they remain most of the time above the mixed layer depth (Dagorn <em>et al</em>. 2000, Schaefer and Fuller 2002, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2008). Deep diving events in excess of 500 m are not uncommon, averaging close to 1,000 m, with a maximum recorded depth of 1,902 m at a temperature of about 3 °C (Schaefer and Fuller 2010, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>This species feeds on a wide variety of fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans during the day and at night. Food studies in the Atlantic were reviewed by Dragovich (1969). Large juveniles and adults exploit the deep scattering layer, consuming mesopelagic fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans at depths to 300–500 m during the day, and in surface waters at night (Dagorn <em>et al</em>. 2000, Schaefer and Fuller 2010, Vaske <em>et al</em>. 2012). Off northeastern Brazil, 83 prey items were found in stomachs of Bigeye Tuna, of which 46 were fishes, mostly epipelagic or mesopelagic species, 20 were cephalopods, and 13 were pelagic crustaceans (Vaske <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Caribbean Pomfret (<em>Brama caribbea</em>) was the most important food item followed by other mesopelagic fishes and a squid (<em>Ornithoteuthis antillarum</em>) was the most preyed-on cephalopod.&#160;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7f520416-7fff-87df-c7f0-baebcef46941"">In the western Indian Ocean, Bigeye Tuna switch from eating lanternfishes and crustaceans to fishes such as lancetfishes, Alepisauridae as they grow (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2020).<span><br/><br/>This species is a multiple spawner that may spawn every one or two days over several months (Nikaido <em>et al</em>. 1992).&#160;They spawn over periods of the full moon, and spawn throughout the year, at least in the western Pacific (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Although spawning apparently occurs widely across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, the greatest reproductive potential appears to be in the eastern Pacific, based on apparent maturation, size frequencies, and catch per unit of effort (Kikawa 1966).&#160;In the eastern and central Pacific, spawning has been recorded between 15°N&#160;and 15°S and between 105°&#160;and 175°W during most months when sea surface temperatures exceeded 24 °C with a peak from April through September in the northern hemisphere and between January and March in the southern hemisphere. Spawning is primarily at night between 1900 and 0400 hr. The average mature female spawned every 2.6 days. The estimated mean relative fecundity is 24 oocytes/g body weight. The number of eggs per spawning has been estimated at 2.9–6.3 million (Fritzsche 1978, Miyabe 1994, Schaefer 2001, Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2005, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Eggs and larvae are pelagic (Kailola <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><span><span><br/>The IGFA all-tackle game fish record for Bigeye Tuna is 236 cm FL, 197.3 kg caught in the Pacific Ocean off Cabo Blanco, Peru, in April 1957. The all-tackle record for the Atlantic is a 178 kg fish caught in the Canary Islands in July 1996 (IGFA 2020).&#160;<span><span>Longevity for this species may vary by region. Estimated maximum age for this species in the Western Pacific is 16 years (Farley <em>et al.</em> 2006), in the Indian Ocean it is 8 years (Tankevich 1982), in the Atlantic Ocean it is 9 to 17 years (Hallier <em>et al</em>. 2005, Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2020), and in the Eastern Pacific is 15 years (K. Schaefer, pers. comm., February 2021). There appears to be geographic variation in length&#160;at 50% maturity based on estimates of 102–135 cm (approximately 3.5 years of age) from different regions of the Pacific Ocean (Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2005, Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sun <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Males tend to dominate the catches over the entire size range (Collette 2010).<br/><br/>Previously, the generation length for this species was estimated to be between 4.4 and 5 years based on age structure data across different stocks (Collette <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Bait boats and other gear types also account for minor landings (Collette and Graves, 2019).<br/><br/>The 2017 stock assessment conclusion in WCPFC (2019) (based on spawning biomass relative to the biomass limit reference point rather than SSB<sub>recent</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub>) was that Bigeye Tuna in the Central and Western Pacific appeared not to be experiencing overfishing or to be in an overfished condition. However, the inclusion of new information on Bigeye Tuna growth and regional structures indicates that the amount of uncertainty in the stock status results is higher than for the previous assessment. Fishery impact is highest in the tropical region, with particularly high fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye tuna (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, Bigeye Tuna is currently overfished and is undergoing overfishing. The current MSY may be less than the MSY achieved in past decades due to overall selectivity shifting to smaller fish. There has been a long-term increase in SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and a general long term decrease in MSY (ICCAT 2018a).<br/><br/>The bigeye stock in the Eastern Pacific is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, SSB is likely around SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and F around F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020). In the Indian Ocean, the stock is not overfished but overfishing is occurring and spawning stock biomass in 2018 was 31% of the unfished levels (IOTC 2019a).","Samples of Bigeye Tuna from the Atlantic Ocean are genetically distinct from those found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (Alvarado Bremer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Chow <em>et al</em>. 2000). Two highly divergent mitochondrial haplotype clades coexist in the Atlantic Ocean (Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2006). One is almost exclusively confined to the Atlantic Ocean while the other is also found in the Indo-Pacific. Genetic studies have shown no population structuring within the Indian Ocean (Appleyard <em>et al</em>. 2002, Chiang <em>et al</em>. 2008). For management purposes, four stocks of Bigeye Tuna are recognized: Atlantic Ocean, eastern Pacific Ocean, western and central Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean. Results from tagging studies demonstrate that a small fraction (~5%) of individuals undertake large (&gt;1,500 km) displacements (which could facilitate some gene flow), but most individuals remained within the general area in which they were tagged. Based on tagging data, as many as nine ecological stocks have been proposed for the Pacific Ocean (Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Global catches of Bigeye Tuna were less than 100,000 mt through the 1960s, increased to about 200,000 mt by 1980, and then quickly rose, peaking at over 500,000 mt in 1998. Current catches have been close to 400,000 mt. Bigeye Tuna are caught primarily by pelagic longlines in targeted catch as well as purse seines, with minor landings from bait boats and other gear types. Pelagic longlines accounted for most of the catches until the 1990s, at which time purse seine catches began to steadily increase (Collette and Graves 2019). Purse seines now account for than half of the catch (Pew 2020). Pelagic longlines typically catch medium to large Bigeye Tuna, while the purse seine fishery typically catches small to medium size fish, that often form mixed schools with Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna associated with FADs. With increases in purse seine fishing effort, there has been a change in the overall selectivity of the fishery, resulting in lower MSYs (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Two methods were used to estimate decline. In the first method (""method 1""), the linear percent change in population size over the last 21 years (three generation lengths) was calculated using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method (""method 2"") that better accounts for non-linear trends, the average annual percent change in population size over the time period for which data are available is calculated, and used to estimate the change in population size over the last 3 generation lengths, assuming an exponential decline. Data for the Eastern Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans were extracted via digitization. To ensure annual data, prior to estimating changes in population size, where more than 1 data point existed for any given year, the average of those data points was taken. If conversely no data point corresponded to a year, we estimated that data point as the average of the preceding and following years.<br/><br/>In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, SBR, or SSB across this species' global range, there has been an estimated 29–32% decline over the past three generation lengths. To account for differences in stock size, declines for individual stocks were weighted by their MSY (ISSF 2020). In at least 40% of its range, in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, this species is considered overfished and/or overfishing is occurring (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean</strong> <br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna by pelagic longline vessels in the eastern Pacific increased in the 1950s, reaching more than 60,000 mt by the early 1960s, and peaked at close to 148,000 mt in 2000. While there were some modest catches by purse seine vessels from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s, catches by this gear type increased dramatically through the 1990s, peaking at about 100,000 mt in 2000. Currently, purse seines account for about 74% of the landings, and pelagic longlines take the other 26%. The change in selectivity of the fishery to smaller fish has resulted in a decrease to the MSY of almost 50%.&#160; In 2019 the total catch was 95,100 mt, close to the five year average of about 98,000 mt. In 2019, it was 95,192 mt (Collette and Graves 2019, IATTC 2020).<br/><br/>Since 1993, there has been, on average, a substantial increase in the fishing mortality of bigeye 2 year-olds and younger. This increase was due to the expansion of the purse-seine fisheries that catch tuna in association with fish aggregating devices (FADs). According to the 2020 assessment, which used a risk analysis approach and 44 reference models, there is a 50% chance that the recent fishing mortality rates are above the level corresponding to MSY and a 53% chance that the recent spawning biomasses are lower than the level corresponding to the dynamic MSY (S<sub>MSY_d</sub>). <br/><br/>Based on both the pessimistic and optimistic estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) (IATTC 2020) and using method 1, the estimated decline in the Eastern Pacific stock population between 2000 and 2019 is between 14 and 31%. Using method 2, the estimated decline is between 18 and 20% over the past 21 years (three generation lengths). Based on MSY, the Eastern Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 22 % of this species global population. In terms of overfishing, spawning biomass has likely been fluctuating around the MSY level and F has probably fluctuated around F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific steadily increased from the 1950s through a peak in the early 2000s, and have averaged about 149,000 mt over the past five years. Pelagic longlines accounted for the majority of the catch through the mid-2000s, but since that time longline catches have dropped by about 25,000 mt. The purse seine fishery increased dramatically through the 1980s and 1990s, and now has catches comparable to those of the pelagic longline fleet. Each accounts for about 44% of the total catch. Due to a change in selectivity of the fishery resulting from increased catches of small fish by the purse seine fleet, the current MSY is less than half of that prior to the 1970s (Collette and Graves 2019). Total catch in 2018 was 145,402 mt (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>Compared to the previous (2014) assessment, the best available information on the 2017 WCPO Bigeye Tuna stock status indicates that the stock status condition is more positive with a central tendency for SB<sub>recent</sub>/SB<sub>F</sub>=0 that is now higher and a Frecent/F<sub>MSY</sub> that is lower. However, the status of the stock in 2017 is also much more uncertain due to more comprehensive technical treatment of structural uncertainty through the use of the model uncertainty grid. The positive changes are mainly caused by three factors: the inclusion of new growth curve information, the inclusion of a new regional assessment structure, and estimated increases in recruitment in recent years. In regards to the latter, it is not clear whether the improvement is caused by positive oceanographic conditions, effective management measures to conserve spawning biomass, some of combination of both, or other factors. The median SSB<sub>recent</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> under the selected new and old growth curve model weightings is 1.23 while the median F<sub>recent</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub> is 0.83. The assessment results also show that, irrespective of the uncertainty grid used, except for the small recent increase, the Western and Central Pacific stock has been decreasing continuously for the past 60 years. In agreement with previous assessments, there has been a long-term increase in fishing mortality for both juvenile and adult Bigeye Tuna and a long-term decrease in spawning biomass from the 1950s to the present (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>Based on the median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the 2018 WCPFC assessment update and using method 1, there has been a 28% decrease in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean population between 1994 and 2015. Using method 2, the estimated decline is 22% over the past 21 years, or three generation lengths. Based on MSY, the Western and Central Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 38% of this species global population. Based on the SPC's 2020 stock assessment, SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> = 1.83, indicating that the western and central Pacific ocean stock is not overfished, and F/F<sub>MSY</sub> = 0.72 indicating that overfishing is likely not occurring (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean </strong><br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna in the Indian Ocean increased steadily from the 1950s, reaching a maximum of more than 150,000 mt in the late 1990s. Pelagic longline has been the dominant gear type throughout, although the overall share has decreased since the early 2000s. Pelagic longlines now account for about 54% of the catches, purse seines 28% and other gear types 18%. Longline catches decreased significantly after the early 2000s, largely due to a shift in the location of the fishery to avoid piracy (Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>The 2018 catch reported in the most recent (2019) stock assessment was 93,515 mt. However, due to concerns on the reported catch data for 2018, the stock status was based on SS3 model formulations using the best catch estimate by the Scientific Committee. Relative to the unfished levels in 2018 and the level that can support MSY, spawning stock biomass in 2018 was estimated to be 31% and 122% respectively. The 2019 assessment outcome is qualitatively different to the 2016 stock assessment due to increased small size catch, changes in modelling assumptions about longline selectivity, and the abundance index developed in 2019. It is estimated that SSB<sub>2018</sub> is above SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub>, both with high probability (IOTC 2019a).<br/><br/>Based on the median of the spawning biomass predicted by the 18 models of the final grid used to produce management advice per IOTC (2019b), and using method 1,&#160; there has been an estimated 46% decrease in the Indian Ocean population between 1996 and 2017. Using the method 2, the population is estimated to have declined by 42% over the past 21 years or three generation lengths. Based on MSY, the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 20% of this species global population. According to ISSF (2020) and IOTC (2020), the Indian Ocean stock is not overfished, but overfishing is currently occurring.<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong>&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/>Bigeye Tuna catches in the Atlantic Ocean increased steadily from the 1960s, reaching a maximum of almost 135,000 mt in 1994. Catches over the past five years have been about 76,000 mt. The pelagic longline has been the dominant gear type, and even though longline catches decreased by more than half since they peaked at just over 80,000 mt in the mid 1990s, this gear type still accounts for 47% of the landings. Purse seine effort increased dramatically in the 1990s and currently accounts for 37% of the landings, while traditional bait boat fisheries produce 13% of the catch (Collette and Graves 2019). Historical estimates show large declines in biomass and increases in fishing mortality, especially in the mid 1990s when fishing mortality exceeded F<sub>MSY</sub> for several years.<br/><br/>The results of the most recent (2018) stock assessment are less uncertain than previous assessment results and this is attributed to the use of an improved joint longline (LL) index, the confirmation that catches continue to exceed TACs, and the use of just one model platform to provide management advice. Based on the combined result of SS318 uncertainty grid in the 2018 stock assessment, relative fishing mortality (F<sub>2017</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub>) in the Atlantic is 1.63. The relative spawning biomass (SSB<sub>2017</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub>) is 0.59.<br/><br/>Based on median of SS3-uncertainty grid SSB estimates (across all 18 runs) (ICCAT 2018b), and using method 1, there has been an estimated 43% decrease in the Atlantic population between 1996 and 2017. Using method 2, the population is estimated to have decreased by 41% over the past 21 years (three generation lengths). Based on MSY, the Atlantic Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 20% of this species global population. According to ISSF (2020), the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring.",Decreasing,"Bigeye Tuna are circumglobal in tropical and temperate seas, but have never been reported from the Mediterranean Sea. They occur as far north as 55–60° in the northern summer and as far south as 45–50° in the austral summer, but young fish and reproductively active fish primarily occur in tropical waters. There are three British records, all in relatively warm waters in the southwest, the most northerly in Wales at 51°40’N, 4°15’W from August 2006 (Powell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Collette and Graves 2019).","This species is an extremely valuable fishery resource, especially for sashimi markets and canneries to a lesser extent. It had an end value of $4.3 billion in 2018. The fish taken in the purse seine fishery are typically destined for canneries, while the larger fish from the pelagic longline fishery mainly enter the sashimi market (Collette and Graves 2019, Pew 2020).",Marine,"This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994). Increased catches of small Bigeye Tuna by purse seines fishing on FADs has resulted in a large change in the size selectivity of the fishery and decreased yields per recruit in all areas.&#160; In some ocean basins, the estimated MSY has dropped by 50% due to the change in selectivity of the fishery, and longline catches of larger fish have declined. Management of the catches of small fish is complicated by that fact that small Bigeye Tuna co-school with small Yellowfin Tuna and Skipjack under FADs. To date, the tuna RFMOs have had difficulty effectively managing the purse seine fishery, and achieving an acceptable balance between the purse seine and longline fisheries (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>In the most recent stock assessment, the Bigeye Tuna stock was estimated to be overfished and that overfishing was occurring in 2017 (ICCAT 2018a). The 2015 assessment also indicated that the stock was overfished (SSB = 0.67 SSB<sub>MSY</sub>), and that over fishing was occurring (F = 1.28 F<sub>MSY</sub>), in contrast to the relatively optimistic assessments prior to and including the 2010 assessment. MSY has decreased over time due to a changing selectivity of the fishery resulting from increased catches of small fish by purse seines fishing on FADs (Collette and Graves 2019). Following ICCAT Recommendation 19-01, there are now catch limits for all parties. TAC is 62.5 for 2020 and 61.5 for 2021. An Atlantic-wide closure on FAD fishing was established for January and February 2020, and January to March 2021. There are also limits on the number of FADs per vessel and many control measures (J. Graves, pers. comm. July 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean<br/></strong>The IATTC has adopted a harvest control rule for tropical tunas. Current conservation measures for Bigeye Tuna include a 72-day closure for large purse seine vessels (&gt;182 mt capacity), a time area closure west of the Galápagos Islands, and limits on the number of active FADs a vessel can monitor (Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/> Based on the 2017 stock assessment, fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye tuna in the tropical region is particularly high. The management advice is therefore that WCPFC14 could continue to consider measures to reduce fishing mortality from fisheries that take juveniles in order to increase bigeye fishery yields and reduce any further impacts on the spawning potential for this stock in the region. It is also recommended as a precautionary approach that the fishing mortality on the Bigeye Tuna stock not be increased from the current level to maintain current or increased spawning biomass until an appropriate target reference point has been agreed upon by the Commission (WCPFC 2019). Existing measures include a three-month closure on FAD fishing in tropical waters, limits on the total number of vessel days, a FAD management plan and a prohibition on discards of tropical tunas (Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>In 2019, the stock status was deemed to not be overfished but subject to overfishing. If catches remain at current levels,&#160;there is a 58.9% and 60.8% probability that MSY reference points will be breached in 2021 and 2028 respectively. With reduced catches of at least 10% from current levels, the probability of breaching the reference levels in 2028 is likely to go down to 49.1%. Continued monitoring and improvement in data collection, reporting and analyses is needed to decrease the uncertainty in assessments (IOTC 2019a). While no specific management measures have been put into place by the IOTC for Bigeye Tuna, some exist for tropical tunas in general, including a FAD management plan and a ban on the discards of tropical tunas by purse seine vessels (Collette and Graves 2019).","",,false,false,Global

Larger juveniles are commonly found in crevices and under ledges on rocky reef from five to 25 metres depth, and smaller juveniles can occasionally occur on shallow seagrass beds and inshore reefs (Colin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996, Renán&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Renán-Galindo 2005, Coleman<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010, Coleman and Koenig 2010). It is unknown if this species aggregates to spawn, but it can be caught in large numbers during the spawning season (Moe 1969, Arreguin-Sanchez and Pitcher 1999, Schirripa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Brulé&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). It is a protogynous hermaphrodite with a size and age of sexual transition of 30 to 68 cm standard length and three to 13 years.&#160;Spawning occurs on the shelf and shelf edge in the Gulf of Mexico in April and May (Coleman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). Off North and South Carolina in the U.S. Atlantic, spawning occurs between mid-February and mid-June (Burgos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). On the Campeche Bank in Mexico, it has a single, annual peak spawning in late winter and early spring (January-March) (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, males and females co-occur year round and do not aggregate for spawning (Coleman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996). Its maximum total length is 125 cm, maximum age is 26 to 29 years and females reach maturity at 4-6 years of age (SEDAR19 2010, SEDAR42 2015).&#160;The oldest individual caught by the offshore Mexican fishery from 1996-1999 was 14 years old (Renán <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Female age at first sexual maturity occurs from 4-6 years and a total length of 45–53 cm (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Ingram&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;Based on a longevity of 29 years, age of first maturity of 5 years, and applying the formula for a hermaphroditic fish in Depczynski<em> et al</em>. (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 17 years.&#160;</p>","<p>Overfishing is a major threat. Secondary threats, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, might include hypoxia and red tides, seismic pulses from air guns used in the oil and gas industry, deployment of pipelines on the seabed and warming waters due to climate change (Coleman and Koenig 2010, Arreguín-Sánchez <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). &#160;</p>","<p>This species is more common on continental coasts rather than insular areas due to habitat preference; for example, it is rarely caught in the West Indies including Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, St. Martin, St. Eustatius, Saba (Nagelkerken 1981), the U.S. Virgin Islands (Randall 1961) and Puerto Rico (G. Garcia-Moliner pers. comm. 2016). It supports fisheries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Moe 1969), Campeche Bank (Solis 1970), Isla Margarita (Cervigon 1966) and Brazil (Stevenson 1981). Gene flow between populations in the Florida Keys and Mexico in the Gulf of Mexico likely occurs (Zatcoff&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). In a comparison of fishery-independent longline surveys conducted over the West Florida Shelf and the Campeche Bank in 2001-2002, Red Grouper were significantly smaller in size and had a higher relative abundance on the Campeche Bank than those on the West Florida Shelf, which may be driven by historical fishing pressure, management regulations or available area carrying capacity (Lombardi-Carlson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008a). According to various types of fisheries data, including landings, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and modelled spawning stock and total biomass, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% over the past three generation lengths, which is a period of about 51 years.<strong><br/><br/>Mexico:&#160;</strong>&#160;This species represents the most important species by catch and weight in&#160;the Mexican grouper fishery, of which&#160;83% occurs in the Gulf of Mexico on the Campeche Bank<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;off the Yucatan Peninsula (Colás-Marrufo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Brulé&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, SAGARPA 2012). From 1998 to 2008, average annual mixed grouper landings in the southern Gulf of Mexico were 828 mt for Veracruz, 810 mt for Quintana Roo (Caribbean), 657 mt for Tabasco, 152 mt for Campeche and 129 mt for Tamaulipas (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;<em>Epinephelus morio</em> comprised about 95% of the total finfish catch in the Mexican offshore fleet during the 1970s, 50-60% from 2004 to 2011 and about 82% in 2014/2015 (SAGARPA 2012, Monroy-García&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Therefore, even though grouper species-specific landings are not collected, it is inferred that declines in the mixed grouper fishery represent declines of <em>Epinephelus morio</em> (E. Sosa&#160;pers. comm. 2017). The population of this species in the Campeche Bank contains the largest natural proportion of its southern Gulf of Mexico population, and <span style="""">from 1986 to 2000, overall biomass is estimated to have declined there by 88% and spawning stock biomass by 25%&#160;(</span>Giménez-Hurtado&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

A fishery-independent study reported that catch per unit effort (CPUE) of <em>E. morio </em>declined by 43% from 1986 to 2002 (3.5 kg/100 hooks to 1.5 kg/100 hooks) (Giménez-Hurtado <em>et al</em>. 2005). The offshore <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Cuban fleet also reported&#160;a 66% decline in average CPUE on the Campeche Bank,&#160;from 6 kg/100 hooks between 1984-1990 to 2 kg/100 hooks between 1999-2002 (SAGARPA 2012). In addition, the offshore Mexican fleet recorded a 50% decline from 1984 to 2008 in average CPUE,&#160;from 2,800 kg/fishing trip between 1984-1990 to 1,788 kg/fishing trip between 1991-1995 and to 1,400 kg/fishing trip between 1996-2008 (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">An average of 31% of Mexican landings from 1970 and 2012 comprised juvenile groupers (Monroy-García&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Immature individuals are also captured by the Mexican inshore fishery, which operates in shallower parts of the Campeche Bank (Brulé&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Giménez-Hurtado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Salas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). Size for both females and males, and size at first sexual maturity and at sex reversal, all decreased between 1989-1992 and 2003-2004, likely due to overfishing (Caballero-Arango&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). This species is still highly valued and effort appears to be increasing (H. Espinosa-Perez pers. comm. 2014).</span><strong><br/><br/>United States:&#160;</strong>This species and the Gag Grouper (<em>Mycteroperca microlepis</em>) are the most frequently captured species in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico commercial grouper fishery, which is concentrated on the West Florida Shelf, especially the Florida Middle Grounds&#160;(Smith&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1975, Bullock and Smith 1991, Koenig and Coleman 2013). In U.S. waters, there are two separately managed populations/stocks: the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Regular stock assessments are conducted by Southeast Data, Assessment, and Review scientists, with SEDAR42 (2015) being the most recent assessment of the Gulf stock and SEDAR53 (2017) the most recent assessment of the South Atlantic stock. Estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) indicate that the Gulf of Mexico stock was overfished between 1986 and 1995, but improved from 1996 to 2013, except for 2000 and 2005. Overall, total biomass increased between 1986 and 2005, which corresponded to declines in fishing mortality. The 2006 Gulf of Mexico stock assessment did not consider this population to be overfished nor to be experiencing overfishing and that the stock had fully recovered (SEDAR12 2006, Cass-Calay and Brown 2007). Overall, total biomass and spawning stock biomass have been increasing in the Gulf of Mexico stock since 2006 (SEDAR42 2015). The predicted biomass in 2006 was at a record low due to the red tide event in 2005, but has increased since.&#160;The Gulf of Mexico stock was considered rebuilt in 2007, and abundance has generally been increasing since 1986, which is a time period of about 30 years. Fishing regulations, at least in part, caused a 70% reduction in recreational harvest by number and a 41% reduction by weight as well as a 21% reduction in commercial harvest in 1990 (Schirripa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). SEDAR19 (2010) was the first formal stock assessment of the South Atlantic stock, which reported that it was overfished with overfishing occurring.&#160;The South Atlantic stock is not yet considered rebuilt since low abundances were documented in the 1980s and early 1990s, but a rebuilding plan has been in place since 2012. According to SEDAR53 (2017), the total biomass and spawning stock biomass declined until the late 1980s, increased until 2006 and declined thereafter by 70% (past 10 years). The stock assessment concluded that the south Atlantic stock is currently overfished with overfishing occurring.<strong><br/><br/>Brazil</strong>: In Brazil, species-specific grouper fisheries data are not available (IBAMA 2006). Until the 1980s, the commercial fishery operating in Abrolhos primarily targeted large groupers, including 'badejo' (<em>Mycteroperca bonaci</em>) and 'garoupa' (<em>Epinephelus morio</em>). With the decline of this fishery, a new market developed for smaller grouper and snapper species, and only 11% of the fleet were targeting large grouper by the year 2000 (Martins <em>et al. </em>2005). The CPUE estimated in the depleted phase (1.4 kg/fisher/day) by Costa <em>et al</em>. (2003) is considerably lower than that in the late 1970s (12 kg/day/fisher). More recently, in the Abrolhos Bank, the CPUE for <em>E. morio</em> declined by 70% from 2005-2007 (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2007). A regional Red List initiative in Brazil listed <em>E. morio</em>&#160;as Vulnerable and the FAO landings reported by Brazil showed a&#160;decline along decades: from 1970 to 1980 (61%), from 1980 to 1990 (30%), from 1990 to 2000 (56%), and from 2000 to 2010 (16%), representing an overall decline from 1970 to 2015 (45 years) of 77.3%.&#160;</span></span></span></p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from North Carolina, south along the U.S. Atlantic, Bermuda, the Bahamas, in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys north to Alabama, the Flower Garden Banks, and from Veracruz, Mexico to northwestern Cuba, throughout the Caribbean Sea and along South America to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It is absent off the river mouths in northwestern Brazil and strays have been recorded north to Massachusetts (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Its depth range is five to 300 metres.</p>","This species is targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries throughout its range. Fishing pressure, by both the Mexican and Cuban commercial fleets is high on the Campeche Bank in the Gulf of Mexico. In Quintana Roo (Mexico), it represents over 30% of the total catch landed (SAGARPA 2012). Most of the Mexican offshore catch is exported to the United States (SAGARPA 2012), with exports peaking at 3,000 to 4,000 mt/year between 1995 to 2000 and 2007 to 2011&#160;(SAGARPA 2014a). In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,&#160;<em>E. morio</em>&#160;is targeted by commercial handline, longline, and trap fisheries as well as recreational charter and private boats. It is the most productive grouper fishery in the southeastern U.S., where it is concentrated on the West Florida Shelf and mainly captured by bottom longline (Koenig and Coleman 2013).",Marine,"In U.S. waters, this species is managed under federal government regulations and regular science-based stock assessments. In the Gulf of Mexico recreational sector, there is a size limit, daily bag limit and annual catch limit for this and other grouper species. In the Gulf of Mexico commercial sector, there is a size limit, a total catch quota, closed season in certain areas, a daily bag limit (SEDAR42 2015). In the South Atlantic, there are also size limits, trip limits and harvest of shallow-water groupers (includes gag, black grouper, red grouper, scamp, red hind, rock hind, coney, graysby, yellowfin grouper, yellowmouth grouper, and tiger grouper) is prohibited from January 1 to April 30 in Atlantic and Monroe County (Florida) waters for the commercial sector. In the recreational sector, there is a size limit, a daily bag limit for all grouper species (SEDAR 53 2017). Management measures implemented in 2004, as part of the Gulf of Mexico red grouper rebuilding plan, include a reduced aggregate commercial shallow-water grouper quota, a red grouper quota within the aggregate quota, and a recreational bag limit of two red grouper within the five fish aggregate grouper bag limit (GMFMC 2008). The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council established 16 marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Gulf of Mexico, such as the Flower Garden Banks, the Florida Middle Grounds, the Madison-Swanson and the Steamboat Lumps Marine Reserves and the Tortugas Ecological reserve (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2004). Conservation of older individuals within some of these areas has been documented (Coleman et al. 2011, Koenig and Coleman 2013).<br/><br/>In Mexico, the grouper fishery is seasonally closed from February 15 to March 15 each year (since 2003) in Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo (SAGARPA 2003). In 2017, the seasonal closure was extended two months from February 1 to March 31 (SAGARPA 2016). Other regulations include limiting commercial fishing permits, gear requirements (hook size), and a minimum size limit (SAGARPA 2009, 2014b). Cuban vessels fishing in Mexican waters operate under a set quota (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monroy-García <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAGARPA 2014a). Species-specific grouper landings data would improve estimates of its population status and further reductions in fishing effort to levels prevailing in the 1980s (SAGARPA 2012, 2014a). Fishing by commercial fleets in the Campeche Bank during spawning season should be reduced as well as the capture of juveniles (Caballero-Arango 2013, Albáñez-Lucero and Arreguín-Sánchez 2014, Brulé <em>et al</em>. 2014, Tuz-Sulub and Brulé 2015). It is unclear whether the seasonal fishery closures have provided an opportunity to recover or not. Brulé et al. (2015) concluded that the hook size regulation in the Yucatan artisanal fishery provides little, if any, improvement. Furthermore, the current minimum size limit 36.3 cm total length is not enough and enforcement of this protective measure is currently unknown. Giménez-Hurtado (2005) proposed prohibiting fishing from zero to 20 metres depth to reduce juvenile mortality, extending the annual fishery closure to February-April to include east of the continental shelf to protect spawners, and prohibiting fishing deeper than 70 m to protect large adults and designate protected areas in critical habitats. These recommendations are supported by studies on catchability (López-Rocha and Arreguín-Sánchez 2008, López-Rocha <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Brazil, marine protected areas (MPAs) are the main conservation tool for populations of this species, including the Abrolhos National Marine Park. Freitas et al. (2017) identified potential additional sites for protection on the Abrolhos Bank that are located outside the current MPA network. Recently, two large MPAs were established within a mosaic of MPAs around the oceanic archipelagos of St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks and Trindade and Martim Vaz. This area covers approximately 900,000 square kilometres, which increased coverage from 1.5% to about 21% of Brazilian waters. A fishing moratorium that included this species was established in 2014 by the Ministry of Environment (MMA 2014), although this has never been effectively implemented.","",,false,false,Global

This species is especially long-lived, with a documented longevity of up to 85 years; this characteristic, combined with a reproductive strategy of protogynous hermaphroditism, can cause it to be particularly susceptible to rapid population decline from fishing pressure.&#160;Fishing caused total and spawning stock biomass declines in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico of 61 and 68% from 1975 to 2009 (end of data time series), and it is inferred that it remains at this low level to the current day. Landings in Brazil have declined due to overfishing since at least 1996 to 2006 by about 84 to 96%. Significant, but unquantified declines are also suspected in Venezuela and possibly Mexico.&#160;Conservation measures are in place in a few areas, but overall, protection from fishing remains insufficient.&#160;Therefore, it is suspected that at least a 30% global decline has occurred over the past 41 years (1975-2016), which is nearly one past generation length (46.5 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next two generation lengths (93 years) due to no anticipated changes in exploitation rates or management efforts.&#160;It is listed as Vulnerable A1bd+4bd. Improvements in fishery management and monitoring are needed.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>This demersal, solitary species inhabits rocky areas and sand-mud bottoms often in or near trenches or burrow-like excavations. It&#160;inhabits moderately deep waters on the continental shelf near the edge and on the upper slope (Smith 1971, Jones&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1989, Heemstra and Randall 1993, Harris and Sedberry 2011). It is often associated with tilefish species due to their similar ecological preferences (Roe 1976, Jones <em>et al.</em> 1989). Juveniles are found shallower and inshore of adults, and have been observed as shallow as 30 metres depth (Smith 1971, Cook&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, NMFS SEAMAP surveys). Its maximum total length is 125 cm (Haimovici <em>et al.</em> 2004). It consumes a wide variety of invertebrates (mainly brachyuran crabs) and fishes (Heemstra and Randall 1993). This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite and females transition to male at 81 cm total length or 22 years. An individual from Trinidad and Tobago was aged to 35 years (Manickchand-Heileman and Phillip 2000). It has been aged up to 85 years in the Gulf of Mexico (Cook <em>et al</em>. 2009) and a female size and age at 50% maturity of 54.7 cm total length and eight years (SEDAR 2011).

It is a long-lived, protogynous hermaphrodite, which increases its susceptibility to rapid declines due to fishing pressure. A recent regulatory shift of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico Red Grouper longline fishery to deeper (470 m) water could lead to increased fishing pressure on tilefish and other deep-water species such as&#160;<em>H. flavolimbatus</em>&#160;(GMFMC 2009, Coleman and Koenig 2010). Its habitat may be negatively impacted by roller-rigged bottom trawl fishing in parts of its range.","This species has declined in many areas due to fishing. Abundance data are limited in many areas and catch is often not species-specific (i.e., lumped with other grouper species). According to stock assessment biomass data, catch and catch per unit effort data, this species is suspected to have undergone at least a 30% global decline or more over the past 41 years (1975-2016), which is nearly one past generation length (46.5 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next two generation lengths (93 years) due to no anticipated changes in exploitation rates or management efforts.<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong> In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, this species has been targeted by the commercial deepwater longline fishery since 1975 (SEDAR22 2011). The most recent stock assessment classified this species as not overfished with overfishing not occurring as of 2009, but model runs indicate it is on the boundaries of these definitions (SEDAR22 2011). Total biomass steeply declined beginning in the early 1980s due to overfishing, levelled off by 1993 at 12,912 metric tonnes, and has been stable at this lower level ever since. Total biomass in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico declined by 61% over 34 years from 33,667 in 1975 to 13,004 metric tonnes in 2009. In addition, spawning biomass declined by 68% over the same time period (30,319 to 9,593 metric tonnes) (SEDAR22 2011). An earlier stock assessment by Cass-Calay and Bahnick (2002) suggested that a decline in longline catch per unit effort (CPUE) had occurred for this species since commercial fishing commenced. A fishery independent survey conducted in the northern Gulf of Mexico since 1972, reported that relative abundance indices of this species significantly declined after 1985 (Pollack and Ingram 2010). This species has also been targeted by both recreational and commercial fisheries in the southeast U.S. Atlantic since at least 1962; commercial landings have been highly variable, and do not have an overall trend from 1962 to 2002; catch per unit effort in the recreational headboat fishery has generally been minimal, but declined by over 90% over 22 years from 0.008 in 1980 to 0.0001 in 2002 (Williams and Dixon 2003; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Mexico: </strong>In Mexico, this species comprises 1% of the mixed-grouper and snapper fishery catch. The grouper fishery, which is typically dominated by catch of<em> Epinephelus morio</em>, has experienced a 50% decline in landings and catch per unit effort over the past 30 years (Instituto de la Pesca 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Cuba: </strong>This species is naturally uncommon in Cuba, and is rare in fisheries catch.<br/><br/><strong>Venezuela: </strong>Snappers and groupers (including this species) have traditionally been exploited on the continental shelf and slope of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago by artisanal fishers, and catch has significantly declined due to overfishing (Mendoza and Larez 2004). The main species exploited by the handline and longline fisheries include the southern red snapper (<em>Lutjanus purpureus</em>) and <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> (Mendoza and Larez 1996). Catch and effort of <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> generally increased from 1981 to 1991 when catch peaked at about 2,400 tons. Since then, catch and effort have been declining and historic lows were registered in the last years of the series (Mendoza and Larez 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>In 1997/1998, a fishery independent survey conducted along the southern Brazilian upper shelf and slope (São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul) considered this species to be 'rare' (0.5 kg per 1,000 hooks per hour and 1.4% of total catch by weight). It was also considered patchily distributed with the highest concentrations recorded at Santa Catarina around Florianópolis from 120 to 135 metres depth specifically on flat mud bottoms near deep trenches (Revizee-Score 1999, Haimovici <em>et al</em>. 2004, Haimovici pers. comm. 2007). There is no targeted fishery in Brazil, but it is retained as bycatch in longline and gill net fisheries that target Snowy Grouper (<em>H. niveatus</em>) and tilefish (<em>Lopholatilus villarii</em>) (A. Olinto pers. comm. 2007). It also occasionally occurs in bottom trawl fisheries that target angel sharks from 80 to 150 metres depth (M. Peres pers. comm. 2006). In southern Brazil, bottom longline and gill net fisheries targeting mainly wreckfish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>), snowy grouper and tilefish have dramatically increased over the past decade. It has been recorded in commercial landings in the states of São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, but statistics are generally lumped with other grouper (cherne) species. Santa Catarina State records commercial landings for <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> under ""chene-galha-amarela"", because it is a particularly important component of the catch in that area, but it may also be registered under the ""cherne"" category. In Santa Catarina, annual grouper landings declined by about 96% from 262,500 kg in 2002 to less than 10,000 kg in 2006 (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, where this species is apparently less naturally abundant, annual grouper landings declined by 84% from 1998 to 2005 (from about 98,000 to 16,000 kg; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information) and by 90% from 1996 to 2005 (from about 400,000 to 40,000 kg; Figure 4 in the Supplementary Information), respectively. It is inferred that population trends of <em>H. flavolimbatus</em> mirror the documented overexploitation of the target species within this fishery (Haimovici <em>et al</em>. 2004, BRASIL 2004, Avila-da-Silva and Haimovici 2005). In addition, due the decline in target species, some longline fishers have redirected effort to other grouper species, which likely includes <em>H. flavolimbatus </em>(Peres pers. obs. 2007).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from North Carolina south along the U.S. Atlantic, throughout the Gulf of Mexico except Cuba, in the Caribbean Sea from Puerto Rico to Tobago and from Mexico to French Guiana, and off Brazil from 12°S to Rio Grande do Sul (Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It may occur in areas between French Guiana and central Brazil. Its depth range is 30 to 370 metres.","This species is exploited by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. It is captured using longline, handline and gill net (Heemstra and Randall 1993).",Marine,"<p>Fishery regulations implemented in U.S. waters apply to the entire snapper-grouper complex, which includes this species.

It is overexploited in Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela and northern Brazil. The population in Guyana is inferred to be in decline based on reduced catch rates and continued fishing effort. Catch per unit effort has significantly declined over the past decade in Suriname and some level of decline is also suspected for French Guiana. Landings in northern Brazil declined by about 30% over the past two generation lengths. In French Guiana, an overseas department of France located between Suriname and Brazil, there are strict limits on fishing licenses, gillnet length, and mesh sizes. However, due to high levels of continuously increasing Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing by boats originating from Brazil, Suriname and Guyana, overfishing is occurring in French Guiana.&#160;<br/><br/>Regulatory measures are not in place or are insufficient in most of its range, and illegal fishing continues to be a major problem that negates efforts to reduce fishing (e.g. Suriname and French Guiana). In addition, mangrove and estuarine habitats, which are important spawning and nursery grounds, are undergoing degradation due to anthropogenic activities. This includes oil extraction activities that occur on and off the continental shelf of the region which have the potential to pollute and degrade these habitats. Based on fisheries dependent data, it is suspected that at least a 30% global decline has occurred over the past 20 years, which is nearly three generation lengths (25 years). Due in part to the lack of anticipated changes in management to discourage illegal fishing, reduce fishing effort or to promote sustainable fishing practices at the regional scale, this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next generation length (8.5 years). It is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd+4bcd.

It is commonly found over mud or sandy mud bottoms near mouths of rivers, estuaries and coastal lagoons. Juveniles and larvae shelter in mangrove swamps as nursery grounds (Carvalho-Filho 1999, Szpilman 2000,&#160;Barletta-Bergan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Barletta and Saint-Paul 2010, Rousseau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). It forms spawning aggregations&#160;in estuaries in the spring and summer in Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela (Carvalho-Filho 1999, Montaño and Morales 2013). In São Marcos Bay, Brazil, spawning peaks twice per year, in November/December and March/April and estimated fecundity ranges between 9,832,960 and 14,340,373 oocytes&#160;(Almeida <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;The maximum length is 120 cm (Chao 2002). Total length at maturity is about 40 cm for males and females. Natural mortality from Maracaibo Lake&#160;(Venezuela) is 0.53, but there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with this estimate (Montaño and Morales 2013). Based on FishLife, the natural mortality for French Guiana was estimated to be 0.37 (Thorson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, M. Tagliarolo pers. comm. 2020).

Targeting of spawning aggregations by fishers contributes to large-scale declines. It is also impacted by degradation of estuarine and&#160;mangrove habitats from anthropogenic activities including intense fishing pressure in Guyana and Suriname with the widespread use of static trawls in rivermouths called 'Chinese seines' that capture a large amount of juveniles (Guyana Fisheries Department 2019). IUU fishing has been identified as a major threat by the Western Atlantic Fisheries Commission (WECAFC/FAO) (FAO 2015).","Within its range, this species is most common in northeastern South America, and it is locally abundant in some areas there (N.L. Chao pers. comm. 2009). Landings reported in the FAO fisheries statistics database are only available for Brazil beginning in 2002. Venezuela only recently began reporting catch of this species to FAO, beginning in the year 2016 at 2,310 t.&#160;Brazil&#160;landings declined by 28% over the past two generation lengths from 27,559 t in 2002 to 19,800 t in 2016 (FAO 2019). Reconstructed catch data are available through the Sea Around Us project with a start year of 1950 for the countries of Guyana, Suriname and Brazil. Landings steadily increased from 1950 to the 1980s, steeply increased in the 1990s, peaked at 30,148 t in 2002 and declined thereafter by 29% to 21,281 t in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Venezuela</strong>:<strong>&#160;</strong>In Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela, commercial fishing intensity is high for this species, fish size in landings has declined, immature individuals frequently occur in the landings and the size of spawning aggregations are sharply reduced. Quantitative fisheries data have not been consistently collected in this area, but based on some stock assessment modeling, it is considered growth and recruitment overfished and at high risk of stock collapse (Montaño and Morales 2013).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Guyana</strong>: This is one of the most important species targeted by artisanal and trawl fleet fisheries in Guyana. The estimated catch of artisanal fisheries was 891 t in 2016 (Guyana Fisheries Department 2019). Catch and effort data are limited, but the largest and most important stocks are inferred to be declining. Many fishing vessels are unregistered and unlicensed.&#160;Catch rates have declined and fisher incomes have declined, particularly as fuel and ice costs increase. Data is currently being compiled&#160;to conduct a stock assessment (Guyana Fisheries Department 2019).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Suriname</strong>:<strong>&#160;</strong>In Suriname, this species is a primary target of a coastal fishing fleet that uses drift gillnets on open or decked wooden vessels. As in other countries, the high value of the gasbladder of this species constitutes an important incentive for the fishery. Landings statistics for this species are not available. However, there has been a significant decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over the last decade, and fishers have increased effort by remaining longer at sea and fishing longer nets. The introduction of the hydraulic winch on many gillnet boats allows for efficient retrieval of the nets, in many cases causing an effective increase in fishing when net length limitations are not enforced (T. Willems pers. comm. 2020). A data-limited method for length-based stock assessment reported a low spawning potential ratio of 15% for the species based on length data for 2017-2018 for Suriname and Guyana combined (T. Willems in prep). Conservation International Suriname is expecting to publish an assessment of catch profiles, CPUE, bycatch and discards in the coastal gillnet fishery in May 2020.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>French Guiana:&#160;</strong>In 2018, this species represented 33% of captures of small scale artisanal fisheries in French Guiana with around 748 t landed (Weiss&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019b). Though roughly estimated in 2012, total catch is not known due to the high level of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated&#160;(IUU)&#160;fishing. About 2/3 of the coastal fishing effort in French Guiana was conducted by IUU fishing fleets from Brazil, Guiana and Suriname (Levrel 2012). IUU Brazilian boats fishing in French Guianese waters fish with nets&#160;12 km in length, which is five times the length of a single net on a French Guianese vessel. This level of IUU fishing effort offsets any beneficial management efforts attempted locally. Boats that participate in IUU fisheries are often illegal in their own countries and often operate outside of their own national framework (i.e. boats with no identification number or fishing licenses) (M. Nalovic pers. comm. 2020). The migration of Brazilian fishers to Amapá State has implications for French Guiana as its coast is illegally exploited by Brazilian fisheries (Jimenez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in press).&#160;Due to this high fishing pressure, this species is overexploited in French Guiana (Levrel 2012). Landings have not declined in French Guiana at the rate they have in neighboring countries. Due to the better condition of the stock in French Guiana,&#160;foreign fleets continue to fish illegally in French Guiana despite risking prison time and loss of their boats if caught by local enforcement agencies (F. Blanchard pers. comm. 2020). The planning process to conduct a data-limited stock assessment is underway for French Guiana (M. Tagliarolo pers. comm. 2020).<br/><strong><br/>Brazil:</strong>&#160;In Brazil, this species has a higher abundance along the northern coast in the states of Amapá, Pará and Maranhão (IBAMA 2007), but can be frequently observed in fish markets of Rio de Janeiro (N.L. Chao pers. comm. 2020). According to a genetics study, the Amazonian coast extending from Amapá to Pará is considered to represent one stock. Despite improvements in technology, catches have continued to decline along the Amazon coast and illegal fishing is increasing. Low genetic variability may be an additional signal that this population has undergone a bottleneck due to overexploitation (Rodrigues&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). There is some suspicion that there is a separate subpopulation in the southern part of its range in Brazil, but this requires further genetic study (N.L. Chao pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/>In Brazil, annual landings of this species were about 22,000 t in the 1990s, with landings from the&#160;Caeté estuary in eastern Amazon at about 122 t (Barletta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998).&#160;Landings in northern Brazil declined from 22,028 t in 2000 to 14,888 t in 2007<span style="""">&#160;(Souza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, IBAMA 2007),&#160;</span>which represents a 32% decline over a 7-year time period, or nearly one generation length.&#160;In Pará State, fishermen reported that the size of individuals in catches has declined over time and that they have had to travel farther to find productive fishing grounds than in previous years. The number of vessel participating in the fishery increased over time and fishing efficiency increased with the introduction of GPS and other technologies (Mourão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;In northern Brazil, this species has been considered to be fully exploited for over a decade. It is one of the five most significant fishery resources in the State of Amapá by frequency of capture and by volume.&#160;The variability in net mesh sizes used by fishing fleets operating in Amapá, Pará&#160;and Maranhão may lead to both growth and recruitment overfishing. Over the last 10-15 years, fishers from Pará&#160;and Maranhão have been increasingly fishing in Amapá&#160;waters and many fishers have migrated to Amapá&#160;over the past decade. This provides a challenge for both the management of fisheries and environmental conservation&#160;(Jimenez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). Fishing effort in the artisanal fisheries that target this species in&#160;Pará increased overall and catch&#160;declined on average from 1996 to 2007. Where catches did increase, it is presumably due to the increase in effort and the stock has likely declined due to overfishing (Seabra 2019).&#160;It is overexploited in Maranhão and immature individuals are frequently landed, which is causing growth overfishing&#160;(de Oliveira 2018).&#160;Landings from Santos, São Paulo, Brazil declined by about 20% from 2010 to 2019 (~one generation length), landing frequency declined by about 40% over the same time period and catch per unit effort increased from 14.5 to 19.6 (kg/frequency) (Instituto de Pesca 2019).",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is distributed in the western Atlantic from the estuarine area of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela to southern Brazil (~30ºS) (Cervigón <em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Aguilera <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998).&#160;Records from the Gulf of Venezuela, Caribbean coast of Colombia and Panama require verification (N.L. Chao pers. comm. 2020).&#160;The depth range is 0-45 metres.","This species is targeted by commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its range&#160;(Barletta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Chao 2003, Mourão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The flesh is valued in fish markets of French Guiana and Guyana. The gasbladder is highly-valued in the international maw trade (with highest demand from China)&#160;and is marketed for supposed nutritional value and medicinal properties and is also used to produce isinglass (Tuuli <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Jimenez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). The high market value of the gasbladder has driven increases in illegal fishing. Reliable data for gasbladder exports from Brazil are not available because much of the trade is illegal and unreported. The Brazil Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC) recorded a total export of fish by-products of approximately 500 t to Asian markets in 2015, the majority of which was composed of gasbladders with an average price of 38.76 USD/kg (Barone <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Fishers interviewed in northern Brazil reported receiving 98.75 USD/kg for gasbladders (Jimenez <em>et al. </em>in press).",Marine,"Due to the large size and commercial importance of this species, monitoring of its harvest levels and population numbers is needed. Regulatory measures are not in place or are insufficient throughout its range.&#160;This species was assessed as Near Threatened on the Brazilian National Red List. There are no known net length or mesh size or license limitations for Brazil or Guyana's gillnet fishery.&#160;The fishery in Lake Maracaibo is open access with no fishing regulation. Net mesh size limitations and a minimum landing size are recommended to improve management (Montaño and Morales 2013). The maximum number of boats in the Suriname fleet is defined by the annual Ministerial Fisheries Decree and was set at 468 licenses in 2020 (T. Willems pers. comm. 2020). The number of licenses in Suriname is higher than the national recommendations, though they are working to align the actual number of licenses with the recommendation. There is a mesh size limit and maximum length limitation of 2,000 m per boat (Department of Fisheries 2003), but this is not strongly enforced. The Suriname Fisheries Management Plan (LVV 2013) recommends the introduction of various measures to combat IUU fishing.&#160;In French Guiana, strict fishing regulations, including limits on the number of licenses and restrictions on the&#160;length and mesh sizes of fishing nets, are in place to control fishing effort. The French Guiana Regional Fisheries Committee (CRPMEM Guyane) is currently conducting a study to characterize the gasbladder market and its economic importance in French Guiana's fishing sector to recommend paths towards a sustainable market (M. Nalovic pers. comm. 2020). Since 2018, regulations have been in place and enforced to manage the gasbladder trade in French Guiana (M. Nalovic pers. comm. 2020). Conservation actions are urgently needed to combat IUU fishing.","",,false,false,Global

It is also found near large coral columns and heads at the edges and slopes of patch reefs (depths of eight to 52 m) and feeds on plankton. It hovers above bottom in caves and shaded areas in reefs (Smith 1997). It is a benthic spawner.

Proxy life history data based on a study of&#160;<em>Coryphopterus kuna</em>: Larvae settle around 7-9 mm SL, adults mature at 10–11 mm SL and then only attain about 17 mm SL. It has a 60-day pelagic larval life and matures rapidly. They are sexually active in as few as three weeks and live for about two months after settlement. This is the first reported fish in which the pelagic larval duration is generally longer than the post-settlement lifespan, which indicates that&#160;<em>C. kuna</em>&#160;may represent the extreme of a bipartite life-history strategy: a relatively slow-growing pelagic larval stage, often with delayed metamorphosis, in combination with a rapidly maturing, high-mortality adult stage (Victor&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).

In the Northeast Atlantic this skate is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl and longline fisheries throughout much of its range. Reported French landings were more than 370 tonnes in 1983, but since 1984 annual landings have been more stable and averaged about 75–150 tonnes. Recent captures of this species in Scottish surveys have been made in waters &gt; 200 m deep, suggesting that its range has been constricted to deeper waters. However, accurate trends in abundance are hard to determine due to changes in survey techniques, as well as some uncertainty in the taxonomic identification in earlier surveys. It is suspected that there have been continuing population declines of 30-50% over three generations for the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation.&#160;</p>    <p></p><p>    </p><p>Few data are available on this skate in the Mediterranean Sea, where it was recorded in only seven of 6,336 tows between 1994 and 1999 at depths ranging from 10–800 m during the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean. More recent records from 2008–2009 identified ten specimens in the southern Adriatic Sea, an area that this species was previously suspected to be absent from, although these records could be misidentifications. This species is rare in Mediterranean trawl surveys. However, this skate likely has a low intrinsic rate of increase suggested by its large body size and large size at maturity. Therefore, further analyses of survey data and close monitoring are needed to elucidate the long-term distribution and relative abundance of this species.</p><p>It is assumed that the rate of decline in the Mediterranean Sea is at least the same or worse than the NEA due to near absence of effective fisheries management there. Therefore it is inferred that this species meets the threshold for Vulnerable, given an estimated 30-50% overall decline in a three generation span from the NEA (from ICES 2012) and suspected 30-50% decline throughout European waters overall in a three generation span. This species potentially meets the threshold for Endangered and thus should be monitored, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p><p></p>","<p>This benthic skate is found in offshore shelf and upper slope waters on sandy and coarse bottoms, predominantly found around 200 m depth but ranging from 30–800 m (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the Mediterranean Sea, it occurs in relatively cold coastal waters and on upper parts of continental slopes in about 30–550 m, but has also been captured in deeper water down to 800 m (Stehmann and Bürkel 1987, Bertrand <em>et al</em>. 2000, Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). </p>  <p>Little is known about the biology and reproductive cycle of this relatively large-bodied skate. It is an egg laying species, producing egg cases that measure about 8 by 5 cm (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984). Specimens caught in the Celtic Seas and North Sea between 1992 and 2011 ranged from 21 to 96 cm and 24 to 70 cm total length (TL) in males and females, respectively (McCully <em>et al</em>. 2012). All female specimens were immature, while only two males at 75 and 96 cm TL were mature. The largest immature male caught was 82 cm TL. This species reaches a maximum size of 100–110 cm (Bauchot 1987). Based on the information available for its congener, <em>L. naevus, </em>the species has an estimated generation length of 9.7 years.</p>","<p>The relatively large body size of this skate suggests that it is sensitive to exploitation. It is taken as bycatch in mixed demersal fisheries through much of its range, including mixed trawl fisheries operating in the outer parts and edge of the continental shelf in both the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. In the Mediterranean Sea it is also caught as bycatch by both bottom trawl and longline fisheries (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Serena 2005). In the Northeast Atlantic it may also be taken as a bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting anglerfish and longline fisheries targeting hake, though information on the catches in these fisheries are poor.&#160;</p>","<p>It is likely that there is poor connection between the two deepwater subpopulations of the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. The overall population trend of this species is of a decrease.</p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>Accurate determination of abundance trends in the Northeast Atlantic is not possible, in the absence of long-term, standardised surveys sampling off the edge of the continental shelf. Historically, this species may have been more widely distributed in shelf areas in the Northeast Atlantic. Reported French landings for this species were more than 370 tonnes (t) in 1983, but since 1984 annual landings have been more stable and averaged about 75–150 t. English surveys in the North Sea have not recorded this species since 1998, though occasional specimens are taken in the Celtic Sea. It is now encountered only infrequently in surveys on the inner continental shelf, though is still present in deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf, suggesting that the main part of the range has contracted to deeper water. Indeed, most recent catches in Scottish surveys have been made in waters deeper than 200 m.</p>  <p>Catches of this skate around Iceland and eastern Greenland has been relatively stable overall, ranging from two tonnes in 1993 to 17 t in 2011, with the highest catch of 37 t recorded in 2001 (ICES 2012). While these catch volumes are low, confusion with Sailray (<em>Rajella lintea</em>) is believed to still occur, suggesting that true catch volumes may be even lower. The French Evaluation Halieutique Ouest Européen (EVHOE) Groundfish survey suggested an overall declining trend in abundance and biomass in waters west of Scotland and Ireland between 1997 and 2011, although this decline appeared to be stabilizing in 2010–2011 (ICES 2012). French landings from the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters have increased from three tonnes in 2000 to 32 t in 2011 (ICES 2012). Spanish landings from this region have been consistently low and stable, ranging from four tonnes in 2000 to eight tonnes in 2008. Purported Scottish landings of White Skate (<em>Rostroraja alba</em>) from these waters<em> </em>may also refer to Shagreen Skate (<em>Leucoraja fullonica</em>) because White Skate is considered depleted in this area (ICES 2013). Although levels of exploitation are unknown for this subpopulation, it is inferred to be declining due to a decrease in survey catch rates and landings.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This species was captured at depths ranging from 200–800 m in only seven of 6,336 tows during the International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) performed throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea from 1994–1999 in depths ranging from 10–800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). It was absent from multiple trawl survey time series data that ran from 1957–1995 and consisted of eight separate surveys conducted by four different survey vessels in the Gulf of Lions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Aldebert 1997). Additionally, it was was absent from both recent and historical surveys in the Adriatic Sea (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al.</em> 2001). While further MEDITS surveys from 2008–2009 found ten specimens of the species<em> </em>in the southern Adriatic Sea (Zupa <em>et al</em>. 2010), an area it was previously thought to be absent from, it is possible that these specimens may have been incorrectly identified Sandy Skate (<em>Leucoraja circularis</em>). Trawl surveys in the south Ligurian Sea and north Tyrrhenian Sea suggest that the species is rare there, with few specimens captured between 1985 and 2004 at depths of 366–549 m (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2005). The trajectory of the Mediterranean Sea subpopulation is currently unknown.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>In the Northeast Atlantic this skate occurs in the offshore waters of the continental shelf from Madeira and northern Morocco. Northwards it is present but sparse in the Norwegian Sea including the Skagerrak, Icelandic waters, the Faroe Islands and east of Greenland (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, ICES 2012). It occurs in low numbers west of Scotland at Rockall Bank, in the Bay of Biscay region, in Iberian waters and around the Azores and mid-Atlantic ridge (ICES 2012). In the Mediterranean Sea it is known from the western and eastern central areas to Tunisia and western coasts of Greece, including the southern Adriatic Sea (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Bauchot 1987, Bertrand <em>et al. </em>2000, Relini <em>et al. </em>2000, Marano <em>et al.</em> 2003, Tinti <em>et al. </em>2003, Serena <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>",There is no information on the use and trade of this species.,Marine,"<p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 t for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa) and North Sea (ICES sub-area IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 metres was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999−2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore not effectively constraining catches. Additional management measures, including a 2006 permanent ban on all deepwater gillnet fisheries at depths of &gt; 600 m imposed by the European Commission (EC), may help to protect the deeper range of this species. The EC also imposed maximum limits on the length of nets deployed and the soak time in the remaining fisheries at depths of &lt; 600 m (EC Regulation No. 41/2006). </p>  <p>Skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters in 2009, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES sub-areas VI−IX). These TACs have also been gradually reduced since then. In 2013, the TAC for all skate and ray species grouped was 21,800 t (regulations are available online at <a href=""http://faolex.fao.org/"">http://faolex.fao.org</a>). Since 2008, the European Commission has obliged member states to provide species-specific landings data for the major North Sea species, including this species<em>,</em> in order to improve understanding of skate stocks in the area (CEC 2008). In 2009, this obligation was extended to other ICES divisions, including the Celtic Seas (CEC 2009), and has been ongoing since 2008 (CEC 2013). Additional management measures, including non-trawling areas in the Mediterranean Sea, could benefit this species as a fraction of the adult population and eggs are often found in trawl cod-ends (Ragonese <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Europe

It is likely to have an extent of occurrence (EOO) of &lt; 5,000 km² as the combined shelf area of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Madeira (333 km²) and the Azores (1,955 km²) is 2,288 km² (EEZ estimate from the See Around Us Project website). The species is currently known to exist in only two locations, and is subject to unregulated fishing mortality in both, albeit a non-target species. The combination of a small EOO (&lt; 5,000 km²) and presence in only two locations with largely unmonitored, unregulated fisheries in operation leads to suspicion of a decline in the number of mature individuals. While species with no commercial value can generally be considered less susceptible to fishing, and there are no catch or landings data available for this species, there is also no information to suggest its post-release survival rate. For this reason, it is necessary to assess the situation precautionarily under the assumption that it may not survive after being discarded.<br/><br/>This skate is considered very rare, or perhaps absent from waters southwest of the Azores (Bloomfield <em>et al</em>. 2011).

It is a large species, reaching a maximum total length of 145 cm, and is exposed to a wide variety of fishing gear and fisheries sectors as it occurs in relatively shallow water. The distribution of the species along the coast suggests about 60% of the population is in South African waters with the remaining 40% in Namibian waters. Stock assessments in the mid-1990s showed the three stocks/ subpopulations in South Africa were all heavily over-exploited, while the Namibian stock/subpopulation was also over-exploited. Despite enforced effort reduction in the South African commercial linefishing sector, trends in standardized catch-per-unit-effort from the linefishery from 1986 to 2017 projected forward to 2022 show an overall decline of the South African population of 41% over three generations (36 years). For the other putative 40% of the population in Namibia, declines in spawner biomass to between 14-47% (depending on method) of the pristine (unfished) level were estimated in the mid-1990s. It is not apparent when wide-scale fishing of the Namibian population commenced – although considerable catches were already being made in in the mid-1960s - so it is uncertain over what time period the decline of this population occurred. Furthermore, much of the Namibian coast is not accessible to recreational shore fishers who catch this species in considerable numbers, and the recreational fishing effort there apparently declined markedly in 2010. There has been no formal monitoring of catches since the late 1990s. Given the estimated 41% decline in the South African population and a decline in biomass to 47% (conservatively) of unfished levels in Namibia, over three generation lengths (36 years), it is estimated that there has been at least a 30% decline in the global population. Therefore this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2bd. Monitoring of the population in Namibia is recommended.","In South Africa, this species attains 50% sexual maturity at 31 cm total length (TL) (males) and 34 cm TL (females), with spawning activity observed throughout its distribution, from the Cape of Good Hope to the Kei River Mouth, during spring/summer. Nursery grounds consist of soft-bottom bay areas at depths less than 50 m depth. The maximum size recorded is 145 cm TL (36.3 kg) and it is common to 115 cm TL (15 kg) (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995).&#160;In Namibian waters, spawning adults start migrating southwards against the north-westerly surface currents at the beginning of the austral summer from the northern end of their distributional range to their spawning grounds, Sandwich and Meob Bays, at the southern end of their distributional range. In South Africa, spawning activity occurs throughout the year, but main spawning season is from August to December with a peak in spring, September to November (Griffiths 1997) and in Namibia spawning occurs from October to March (Kirchener&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;It is suggested that after spawning, larvae drift north with the current to their nursery areas, the West coast Recreational area. When juveniles reach the age of approximately 2 years they will gradually move north towards the adult feeding ground, the Skeleton Coast Park waters. At the end of the spawning season when the surf-zone water temperature decreases, adult individuals complete their spawning cycle by returning to the adult feeding ground, probably moving slightly offshore and with the current (Kirchner and Holtzhausen 2001).<br/><br/>Adults are primarily found offshore at depths between 10 -120 m and juveniles occur on soft bottoms at depths of less than 50 m, recruiting into shallow embayments (5-10 m depth) but moving offshore with growth. In cooler waters of the southern Cape and in Namibian waters the species is more common in the surf zone (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). Namibian<em> A. inodorus</em> are restricted to a narrow coastal band of 1-20 m, apparently as a result of an anoxic zone which extends beyond this depth (Griffiths 1997). Tagging data from South Africa show that the species has strong site fidelity but is capable of occasional long-distance movements (Griffiths 1997).&#160;It feeds on pelagic and demersal fish such as anchovy, round herring and hake, also on shrimp and squid (Drapeau <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>This species reaches a maximum age of 28 years in northern Namibia (Kirchner and Voges 1999) and 25 years in South Africa (Griffiths 1996, Donovan 2000). Natural mortality estimated for South Africa is 0.1 - 0.2 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Griffiths 1997); Namibia: 0.21 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Kirchener 2001). Generation length for this species is 12 years (C. Attwood and H. Winker, University of Cape Town, unpubl. data).","Line fishing is the major threat for this species, although there is also a considerable bycatch made by hake and sole trawlers in South Africa. In Namibia this species was overfished to such an extent that the spawner biomass-per-recruit was near the threshold level of 25% of the unexploited level (Kirchner 2001).","<em>Agyrosomus inodorus</em> is the most valuable linefish species in Namibia and one of the most important commercial linefish species on the eastern seaboard of South Africa (Griffiths 1997). It has been targeted for more than 150 years by both commercial and recreational fisheries (Pappe 1866, Griffiths 2000). Research based on otoliths, morphometry, growth rate and tagging indicated that four stocks/subpopulations occur throughout its range with one in Namibia (Kirchner and Holtzhausen 2001) and three in South Africa (Griffiths 1996, 1997). More recent genetic work has shown significant population differentiation between the Namibian and South African stocks (Henrique <em>et al.</em> 2014), but not among the three proposed South African stocks (Griffiths 1996). The cool-temperate Benguela region is a barrier for <em>A. inodorus</em> populations between the two countries (Mirimin <em>et al</em>. 2016). The lack of genetic structuring in South Africa indicates strong gene flow among the three South African stocks, albeit that they are characterized by distinct growth patterns. The Henrique <em>et al.</em> (2014) study comparing nuclear and mitochondrial data from Namibia and South Africa, respectively, suggested that the shallow, significant population structure found between these two regions is due to a limited number of migrants (geographic separation) and historically large populations.&#160;<br/><br/>Commercial catches in Namibia averaged around 500 t per year from 1964 (Kirchner 1998, Kirchner 2001), and were around 700 mt in the mid-1990s. Historic landings are not available for total catches made by recreational anglers. It was only from the mid- to late 1990s that a roving creel survey was implemented to estimate recreational catches, which proved to be of the same magnitude as that made by commercial fishermen (Kirchner 2001, Kirchner and Beyer 1999). Numbers in Namibia caught from 1995 - 1996 were estimated at 524,000 fish (230,000; 219,000; and 75,000 caught by recreational shore anglers, commercial line boats, and recreational skiboats, respectively) (Holtshauzen <em>et al.</em> 2001). In the 1990s this species contributed about 60-70% to all Namibian linefish catches (Kirchner<em> et al.</em> 2001) but this proportion has declined with the temperature-mediated southward movement of the congeneric <em>A. coronus</em> from Angola into Namibian waters (Potts <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The proportion of <em>A. coronus</em> in the central Namibian recreational linefishery for <em>Argyrosomus </em>spp increased from 8% to 57% by number in the period from 1993–1995 to 2009, and a consequence of this has been hybridization with <em>A. inodorus</em>, although the ecological implications of this are not clear (Potts<em> et al.</em> 2014). Stock assessments on the 1995-1998 catches showed that the Namibian biomass had declined to 14-35% or 30-47% of the unfished level, depending on assessment method and input parameters utilized (Kirchner 2001). There has been no monitoring of catches in the Namibian linefishery since the late 1990s (Margit Wilhelm, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, University of Namibia, pers. comm.), although Kirchner and Stage (2005), reported in Belhabib <em>et al </em>(2016) reported that catch rates subsequently declined. Differences between observed and expected levels of genetic diversity in Namibian and South African fish using bottleneck tests indicated that South African stocks have undergone a demographic decline, which agrees with the critically low spawner biomass-per-recruit stock estimates, the reduced biomass and declining catches and catch-per-unit-effort (Mirimin <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Following several earlier publications (Smale 1985, Hecht and Tilney 1989) indicating substantial declines since the 1960s, spawner biomass-per-recruit estimates of 2.9-12.5% of pre-exploitation levels in the three South African stocks showed that they had collapsed (using data from 1986-1994), with recruit overfishing severely affecting population growth potential (Griffiths 1997). Nonetheless the species remained an important target of commercial line, gill, and beach-seine fisheries (Griffiths 2000, Lamberth <em>et al</em>. 1997, Hutchings and Lamberth 2002), recreational fishers (Griffiths 2000) and bycatch in trawl fisheries (Attwood <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the 1990s, annual catches were around 835 mt by commercial linefishing and 217 mt for the hake-directed trawl fishery (Griffiths 1997), while declared catches in 2003-2006 by these fisheries were 339 mt and 294 mt (197 mt landed), respectively (Attwood<em> et al.</em> 2011). Modelling of standardized CPUE (Winker <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Winker <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014; see Supplementary Material) using South Africa’s commercial linefish data between 1986 and 2017 and projecting forward to 2022 shows an overall decline of 41.3 % over three generations (36 years) (Winker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), notwithstanding an apparent recovery from 2000-2008 following a substantial reduction in the number of commercial linefish licenses issued after 2003.",Decreasing,"<em>Argyrosomus inodorus</em> occurs from Namibia (Cape Frio ~18°S) southwards around the Cape of Good Hope and northwards on the east coast of South Africa at least as far as the Kei River. It has a depth range of 10 -120 m. The species is not known in Angola (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, Potts <em>et al.</em> 2014).","This species is the most significant linefish species of Namibia (Kirchner 2001) where it is exploited by three different fisheries namely, (a) commercial linefish boats, (b) commercial skiboats and (c) recreational shore fishermen. Every year an average of about 1000 tonnes is recorded from all three fisheries combined (Kirchner and Holtzhausen 2001). It is also reportedly caught as bycatch by the hake trawl fishery (Dr. Samuel Mafwila, University of Namibia, pers. comm.), but more recent monitoring data were not available for the assessment. The recreational shore fishery (with many tourist participants) contributes substantially to the economy (US$3.7 million in 2001; Holtzhausen <em>et al.</em> 2001). In Namibia, recreational anglers caught 361 mt of&#160;<em>A. inodorus&#160;</em>between 1995 and 1996 (Kirchner and Beyer 1999). Line-boat fishermen caught an average of 413 mt per annum from 1989-1993 (unpublished data, Namibian Ministry of Sea Fisheries), and shore anglers landed in excess of 40,000 fish (approx. 130 mt) a year (Lenssen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991). Current catch levels are unknown. Commercial linefishing effort was unrestricted at least until 2005 and doubled from 1995 to 2005 (Kirchner and Stage 2005). Numbers of recreational fishers reached a peak of around 62,000 in 2009.<br/><br/>This species is also targeted by the South African linefishery including commercial and recreational vessels in which the fish are caught manually using handlines or rod and reel. It is also landed as a bycatch of the sole- and hake-directed inshore (&lt; 120 m depth) trawl fishery between Cape Agulhas and Port Alfred. They are also caught by rock and surf anglers and commercial beach-seine fishermen between Cape Point and Cape Agulhas (Griffiths 1997). The South African commercial linefishery catches averaged 835 mt/year (1988-1992) and the recreational fishery was thought to catch about the same amount (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995). Trawlers average by-catch of 217 mt/year, while shore anglers catch between 4-26 mt/ year.&#160;In the area between the Kei River and Cape Agulhas,&#160;<em>A. inodorus&#160;</em>rarely enters estuaries or the surf zone, and is caught mostly by skiboat fishermen on hook and line (aka linefishing), and by trawlers at depths of 10-100 m. . The proportion of <em>A. inodorus</em> in shore catches declines in northern Namibia, where it is gradually replaced by <em>A. coronus</em> (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, Potts <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Marine,"Because of the similarity in appearance between four species in the <em>Argyrosomus</em> genus in the region, identification by fishers is difficult and thus it is very difficult to enforce restrictions.&#160;In 2001, the bag limit (all species combined) for recreational shore anglers in Namibia was reduced to 10 fish per day from 30 fish per day and a compulsory fishing license was instituted. However, these restrictions are not believed to be enough to halt the decline of the <em>A. inodorus</em> stock. Most shore anglers catch far less than the total daily catch limit in any case, and experiences from South Africa suggest that restricting total catches, rather than the catches of individual species, can be an ineffective method of protection. The Namibian linefish regulations state that shore anglers are required by law to release kob (<em>A. inodorus</em> and <em>A. coronus</em>) smaller than 40 cm and are only allowed to catch two kob larger than 70 cm per shore-angling day. Of the approximately 1,500 km Namibian coast, only the 325 km along central West Coast Recreational area is completely open to recreational shore fishing; the rest has restricted access, in part due to closed diamond mining areas. Fishing is prohibited in the Skeleton Coast National Park (Potts <em>et al</em>. 2014), and there is a linefish sanctuary which extends 6 nm offshore from Meob Bay to Sylvia Hill. Commercial linefishers are not subject to any other restrictions other than their permit requirements (Kirchner and Sale 2005). Demersal trawling is not allowed in depths &lt; 300 m, and yet <em>Argyrosomus </em>(either <em>A. inodorus</em> or<em> A. coronus</em>) are reported as bycatch in Namibian hake trawls (Samuel Mafwila, University of Namibia, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Commercial linefishing effort in South Africa has theoretically been reduced by about 50% because fewer licenses were issued as of ca. 2003, although it is not clear whether this only removed latent effort. A minimum size limit of 40 cm was in place since the 1940s, but this was increased to 50 cm in 2005. There is currently an <em>Argyrosomus</em> size limit of 50 cm (but only one fish &gt; 110 cm is allowed)&#160;and a daily recreational bag limit of five, west of Cape Agulhas. East of Cape Agulhas there is a size limit of 60 cm and a daily bag limit of one for <em>Argyrosomus</em> species caught from the shore or in estuaries. The species occurs in several MPAs in the Western Cape, but most catches are made beyond their boundaries. Trawlers must move at least 5 nm away if kob (<em>Argyrosomus </em>spp) catch in a drag exceeds 20% of sole-directed, or 5% of hake-directed catches.","",,false,false,Global

It is threatened by overexploitation through small-scale targeted fisheries and as bycatch in trawl fisheries, and as a result of habitat loss from destructive fishing practices, coastal development, and pollution. Levels of exploitation obtained through fisher interviews indicate localised&#160;declines of  <em>Hippocampus</em> spp. in the late 1990s and early 2000s, though few  quantified estimates of declines are available. As these declines were  reported from several parts of its range, it is suspected that the  species had undergone a decline of at least&#160;30%  or more within a 10 year window. The primary  threats to this species have not ceased, and some may be  accelerating.&#160;It is suspected that these threats are likely  contributing&#160;to further declines, and thus&#160;the  previous estimate of decline is still applicable.&#160;No further studies on population size or trends,&#160;or  on threats to the species have been undertaken since the previous assessment. Therefore <em>Hippocampus histrix </em>is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd+4cd.","<em>Hippocampus histrix</em>&#160;is found at depths between 10 and 40 m but may also be found deeper than this (Lourie 2016). This species is found on a variety of substrates including sponges, weedy rocky reefs, soft corals, and seagrass beds (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004, Kuiter 2000, Lourie 2016). <br/><br/>Little is known about feeding, but this species likely consumes small  benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans such as harpacticoid and cyclopoid  copepods, gammarid shrimps, and mysids (Woods<em> et al.</em> 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos <em>et al. </em>2008, Yip<em> et al. </em>2015, Valladares <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; <br/><br/>Seahorses including <em>H. histrix </em>are ovoviviparous and the males give birth to live young (Foster and Vincent 2004). The species reaches a maximum size of 17 cm, has a gestation period of 12-14 days, and matures at around 10 cm (Masuda<em> et al. </em>1984). <br/><br/>All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al.</em> 1999) - all traits which make seahorses vulnerable to exploitation. There are however some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity that may make seahorses more resilient to exploitation (Morgan 2007). However a specialised life-history coupled with a dependence on shallow habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation. The importance of life history parameters in determining response to exploitation has been demonstrated for a number of species, including seahorses (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 1998, Foster and Vincent 2004).","The major threat to <em>Hippocampus histrix</em> is over-exploitation. This species is caught in both targeted fisheries and as bycatch in other non-selective fisheries, particularly shrimp trawls&#160;(McPherson and Vincent 2004, Meeuwig <em>et al. </em>2006, Perry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).&#160;<em>H. histrix </em>has been reported in international trade since the mid 1990s and even at this stage, interviews with fishers and traders reported declines in the availability of seahorses (McPherson and Vincent 2004, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Although daily catch rates on individual vessels are quite low, the cumulative impact of the Indo-Pacific trawl fleet leaves little doubt that byactach is affecting populations of this species (Vincent<em> et al.</em> 2011, Lawson <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; <br/>This species' coastal seagrass and coral habitats are threatened throughout its range by eutrophication, sedimentation, coastal construction, dredging, destructive fishing practices such as trawling and dynamite use, and climate change (Carpenter<em> et al. </em>2008, Normile<em> et al.</em> 2016, Short <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Seahorses have a life history and ecological traits that may increase their susceptibility to these threats (see Habitats and Ecology).","To date there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for <em>Hippocampus histrix. </em>There is little information on population size or trends, but the species is inferred to be declining based on data from fisher interviews and from habitat loss and degradation.&#160; <br/><br/>In parts of its range fishers and traders have reported declines in the availability and/or size of seahorses. For example, in 1998 and 1999 in Malaysia and Thailand, surveys of both fishers and traders reported declines in the availability of seahorses including&#160;<em>H. histrix </em>of 68 +/-24% over 12 years, although a minority of fishers reported stability (Perry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010)<em>.&#160;</em>There are also reports of severe general seahorse declines since the 1970s in the Philippines (O'Donnell <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In East Africa, surveys of fishers and traders in 2000 documented declines over the previous 20 years in seahorse availability and size, which included&#160;<em>H. histrix</em>&#160;(McPherson and Vincent 2004). These declines based on fisher interviews are complicated to accurately quantify, but it can be surmised that they are occurring. <br/><br/>General seahorse population declines within the range of&#160;<em>H. histrix</em>&#160;are suspected as a result of habitat degradation and declines in seagrasses (Marcus <em>et al</em>. 2007, Short <em>et al</em>. 2011), and mortality from intense trawling bycatch (<em></em>Giles <em>et al</em>. 2006, Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010) - and indeed these threats are known to occur throughout this species' range (FAO 2001, Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Since declines are reported for several disparate parts of its range, it is suspected that these declines are&#160;occurring&#160;globally for&#160;<em>H. histrix. </em>It is conservatively suspected that the rate of decline has been at least 30% for the past 10 years and that this decline is expected to continue into the future. This decline rate is lower than that reported by most fishers.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus histrix </em>is widespread in the Indo-Pacific, occuring from southeastern Africa and Madagascar to Japan, Hawai'i, and French Polynesia (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2016).

This species is traded both live, for the aquarium trade as well as dry, for use in traditional medicine. <br/><br/>Trade in this species has been reported from countries throughout its range including from as early as 1996 in Malaysia and Thailand (Perry&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010), Kenya and Tanzania (McPherson and Vincent 2004) and Vietnam (Meeuwig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).&#160;Since the implementation of the listing of all seahorse species on CITES Appendix II in 2004, there have been reports of approximately 200 thousand individuals traded annually between 2004 and 2010 and (Evanson <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;UNEP-WCMC 2012a). Given that a large proportion of the trade reported to CITES is only reported to the genus level, it is possible this volume underestimates the true extent of trade in this species (Evanson <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;In the CITES Trade Database, international trade in this species has been reported from many countries throughout its range including, China, Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan (UNEP-WCMC 2012a). &#160;In 2010, this species was selected by the CITES Animals Committee for the Review of Significant Trade following COP15 due to large amounts of potentially unregulated international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2012b).&#160;<br/><br/>Although it was originally suspected that this species was only rarely traded live for the aquarium trade (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004),&#160;&#160;large volumes of trade in live specimens have subsequently been reported to CITES, primarily consisting of wild-caught specimens originating in Indonesia (Evanson <em>et al. </em>2011, UNEP-WCMC 2012a).<br/><br/>When looking at trade in&#160;<em>H. histrix</em>, it is important to note that this species name is often used as a label for any spiny seahorse from the Indo-Pacific and therefore may contain specimens of other species (Lourie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).",Marine,All&#160;<em>Hippocampus&#160;</em>species are listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

More recent population estimates are not available. However, declines are suspected to be continuing, as fishing pressure has not ceased and recent substantial illegal trade interceptions have indicated past levels of offtake for this species may have been underestimated. It is therefore conservatively suspected that population declines of at least 30% have taken place over the past 10 years (more than three generation lengths for this short-lived seahorse). <em>Hippocampus ingens</em> is therefore listed as Vulnerable under Criterion A2cd.</p>","<em>Hippocampus ingens </em>inhabits waters to 60 m depth.

Surveys of Latin America in the early 2000s have estimated that between 199,000 and 380,000 seahorses are incidentally caught on the Pacific coast each year (Baum and Vincent 2005). There was also anecdotal evidence from fishers and traders of declines in seahorse availability, which raises conservation concerns for this species (Baum and Vincent 2005). <br/><p>This species may be particularly susceptible to decline resulting from degradation of habitat from coastal development, tourism and fisheries because they inhabit relatively shallow areas&#160;(Lourie&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al</span>. 2004)&#160;where these threats are most pronounced.

Target <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. ingens</span> fisheries on the Pacific coasts of Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Peru have experienced declines of approximately 50% in a similar time period (Baum and Vincent 2005). It is therefore conservative to estimate a decline of just 30% over its entire range occurred over the preceding three generations. Although there is no more up-to-date information, pressures and declines are suspected to have continued and possibly even accelerated. This species has repeatedly been confiscated in Peruvian waters en route to China, the most recent seizure totalling 8 million animals (Actman 2016). Such a high level of exploitation, whether through bycatch or targeted fishing, is likely impacting the population.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus ingens</em> is endemic to the Eastern Pacific, and is found from Long Beach, California through the Gulf of California to Peru, including the Cocos, Malpelo and Galápagos Islands (Saarman <em>et al.</em> 2010, Lourie <em>et al.</em> 2016, Mathewson 2016).","This species is of commercial importance for the international aquarium trade (Sánchez 1997), the traditional medicinal trade, and as curios (Baum and Vincent 2005, Vincent <em>et al. </em>2011).

Recently, Peruvian authorities have purportedly made multiple seizures of large hauls of dried <em>Hippocampus ingens </em>that  were destined for China. In 2012 an illegal shipment of 16,000 animals  was confiscated (BBC 2012), and in June of 2016 a substantially larger  shipment of 8 million animals was intercepted (Actman 2016).

Trade documented through CITES has ranged from hundreds to several thousand over the past several years, but illegal trade is suspected to dwarf this number.

Therefore <em>Hippocampus spinosissimus</em> is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2d.","<em>Hippocampus spinosissimus </em>are found in reef systems, occupying silt/sand bottoms (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004). In the central Philippines this species is most commonly found on relatively barren soft or sandy bottoms, in shallow depressions associated with octocorals, sea stars, sea pens, sea urchins, sponges, submerged wood and macroalgae but is seldom found on reefs or in association with hard corals (Morgan and Panes 2008). Malaysian trawls containing <em>H. spinosissimus</em> also captured similar substrates (Choo and Liew 2003).

Evidence from fisher surveys indicated local declines in seahorse availability and catch, including <em>H. spinosissimus</em>,&#160;in the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand and that the majority of <em>H. spinosissimus</em> are landed as bycatch (Morgan and Panes 2008, Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010).

Targeted fishing in the central Philippines caused local declines of <em>H. spinosissimus </em>of&#160;over 80% over two months (Panes and Giles 2004). Fishers in the Philippines have reported high levels of decline in seahorse catches between 1970 and 2003 (O'Donnell&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). The fishers in the Philippines cited overfishing, the increasing population of fishers and indiscriminate catch of seahorses, including pregnant and immature seahorses, as causes of the observed decline in catch rates (O'Donnell <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>Most fishers interviewed in this species'  range states reported declines that were at times substantial between  1995 and 2000 (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).

There is currently a national ban on the capture and trade of seahorses in the Philippines as per The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998: Republic Act No. 8550. Other countries such as Cambodia, China and Sri Lanka have also reported bans on trade in seahorses (UNEP-WCMC 2012b).

54906903,40802,Hippocampus barbouri,Vulnerable,A2cd,2017,2017-01-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Hippocampus barbouri</em> is a coastal seahorse species that inhabits seagrasses in shallow waters off the coasts of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Details of population size and trends are sparse, but the existing indirect evidence suggests cause for concern, especially as&#160;<em>H. barbouri</em> is among the more commonly traded species internationally. Fisher-reported declines have been documented in the past. Due to this extensive and continuing trade, combined with mortality from ever-present bycatch and ongoing destruction of its seagrass habitats, it is suspected that this species has undergone declines of at least 30% in the past 10 years. Therefore <em>Hippocampus barbouri </em>is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd.<br/><em></em>","<em>Hippocampus barbouri</em> occupies shallow seagrass beds up to a maximum depth of 10 m (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004). The species feeds primarily on calanoid copepods and decapod larvae, but has also been known to ingest euphausid shrimps and the larvae of polychaetes and fish (Garcia <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>This species may be particularly susceptible to decline due to it&#160;occurring&#160;in this very vulnerable in-shore habitat (Short <em>et al. </em>2011) and having ecological and life-history traits that make the species susceptible to exploitation (Foster and Vincent 2004).&#160; As is the case with all seahorses, this species is ovoviviparous and the males give birth to live young (Foster and Vincent 2004). All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002, Foster and Vincent&#160;2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al.</em> 1999); these traits make seahorses vulnerable to harvest and bycatch. There are some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity that may make seahorses more resilient to exploitation (Morgan 2007).&#160;However a specialized life-history coupled with a dependence on shallow habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing and other anthropogenic pressures are cause for concern.","<em>Hippocampus barbouri </em>is threatened by exploitation, from targeted small-scale fisheries as well as bycatch in trawl fisheries (Vincent <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is targeted and retained as valuable bycatch for the global trade in traditional medicine and aquarium fishes (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>This species is also threatened due to a loss of seagrass habitat in the region, which results from destructive trawl fisheries, shrimp aquaculture, coastal development and sea-filling, and pollution (Short<em> et al.</em> 2011).","Population estimates for <em>Hippocampus barbouri</em> are currently unknown but trade surveys conducted by Project Seahorse have shown that this species is widely traded for traditional medicine, the aquarium trade and for curios (Vincent 1996, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010<em>, </em>Foster 2016). There is also evidence from fisher surveys that there have been local declines in seahorse numbers generally in Malaysia and the Philippines (O'Donnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010) and it can be suspected that similar reductions are&#160;occurring&#160;throughout this species' range where the same threats are found.<br/><br/>Respondents at various levels of trade (including fishers, buyers, wholesalers, retailers, exporters and officials) &#160;in 1998 and 1999 in Malaysia reported declines in seahorse numbers and availability and that&#160;<em>H. barbouri</em>&#160;was one of the most common species traded (Perry&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). If declines from this study are extrapolated to 2016, seahorse numbers declined by approximately 58% in Malaysia over the past ten years (Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Surveys in Thailand showed similar results, with the population declining by 56-88% over the past ten years (Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In the Philippines seahorse fishers also reported substantial declines between 1970 and 1994 (O'Donnell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Although this study did not focus on&#160;<em>H. barbouri</em>, these trends are indicative of seahorse populations in the area where this species occurs. The fishers in the Philippines cited overfishing, the increasing population of fishers, and indiscriminate catch of seahorses, including pregnant and immature seahorses, as causes of the observed decline in catch. If extrapolated to 2016, seahorses declined in the Philippines by about 66% (O'Donnell <em>et al. 2</em>010).<br/><br/>General seahorse population declines within <em>H. barbouri</em>'s<em> </em>range&#160;are suspected as a result of habitat degradation and declines in seagrasses (Marcus <em>et al. </em>2007,&#160;Short <em>et al. </em>2011, Lim <em>et al.</em> 2011), and mortality from intense trawling bycatch (<em></em>Giles <em>et al.</em> 2006, Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010) — and indeed these threats are known to occur throughout this species’ range (FAO 2001, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Declines in seagrasses are particularly concerning as this is <em>H. barbouri</em>'s<em> </em>primary habitat.&#160;In addition, <em>H. barbouri </em>is reported in&#160;international trade in large volumes (<em></em>UNEP–WCMC 2016). Trade in this species has been reported from as early as 1998 in Malaysia (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010), and since the implementation of the listing of all <em>Hippocampus </em>species in 2004 on Appendix II of CITES (UNEP-WCMC 2016). The large and potentially unregulated numbers of&#160;<em>H. barbouri</em>&#160;in international trade led this species to be selected by the CITES Animals Committee for the Review of Significant Trade following COP15 (UNEP–WCMC 2012). This RST determined that a large proportion of international trade in seahorses was made up of <em>H. barbouri</em> (Foster 2016)<em>. </em>This major threat has been acting on this species for more than ten years, and it is reasonable to suspect that trade will continue into the future.<br/><br/>Although not quantified, most fishers interviewed in this species' range states reported declines that were at times substantial between 1995 and 2000 (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017). Although these declines were prior to the current 10 year time frame over which the species is being assessed, fishing and especially trawling pressure has increased substantially across this species' range in the past decade.<br/><br/>Overall, due to previous declines reported by fishers, intensification of the fisheries in the region, and habitat degradation and loss, it is suspected that declines of at least 30% in Barbour's Seahorse have occurred over the past 10 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus barbouri</em> is recorded from the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia to a maximum depth of 10 m (Lourie <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Philippines, the species' range includes the southern portion of Luzon, the Visayas, Palawan, and Mindanao. In Malaysia the species occurs off the coast of northwestern Sabah. The species is present off Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and&#160; Kalimantan in Indonesia.","<em>Hippocampus barbouri</em>&#160;has been widely reported in international trade for use in traditional medicine, curios and for the aquarium trade (UNEP–WCMC 2012a, Hou <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Malaysia, the majority of seahorses, including <em>H. barbouri</em>, are caught as bycatch in other fisheries but some are&#160;caught in small-scale target fisheries where fishers catch them by hand or with nets (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>Declines in seahorse availability have been reported for several countries where <em>H. barbouri</em> is known to occur.&#160;Surveys in 1998 and 1999 in Malaysia and Thailand reported trade in this species and that both fishers and traders noted the availability of seahorses had been decreasing (Perry&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Surveys in the Philippines have also reported more recent and substantial declines in catch rates of seahorses generally (O'Donnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). There is, at present, a national ban on the capture and trade of seahorses in the Philippines (Philippine Department of Agriculture 1998), however field research in the area revealed that fishing continued in spite of the ban (O'Donnell <em>et al. </em>2010, UNEP–WCMC 2012b).<br/><br/>Since the implementation of the CITES Appendix II listing of seahorses in 2004 this species has been one of the most traded seahorses and large volumes of both live and dry trade in<em> H. barbouri</em>, approximately 200,000 individuals per annum, have been recorded (UNEP–WCMC 2012a). And given that a large proportion of the trade reported to CITES is only reported to the genus level, it is possible this volume underestimates the true extent of trade in this species (Vincent<em> et al.</em> 2013, Foster 2016). Taken together this information suggests continued exploitation of this species throughout its range.<br/><br/>Fishers in Sulawesi sell their catch to dealers in Makassar, and from there they are sent to Bali for international export (Lourie 2016).<br/><br/>In Pulau Badi, Sulawesi, there is a land-based aquaculture initiative that provides a source of this species for the aquarium trade.

The species is exploited both as a targeted species and as bycatch and subsequently traded for use as curios, aquarium pets, and in traditional medicines. In addition, seagrass and mangrove habitats are declining globally as a result of human impacts, especially in Southeast Asia. Fishers have reported substantial declines in seahorses in several places across this range. Given that previous declines were reported, more recent data are only  available for one locality but still show declines, and that pressures  on habitat have not ceased and may be accelerating, overall it is  suspected that declines of at least 30% have occurred for this species over the past 10 years and that these declines will continue into the future. Therefore this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd+A4cd.","<em>Hippocampus mohnikei</em> inhabits areas with seagrasses (including <em>Zostera </em>spp., <em>Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii,</em> and <em>Enhalus acoroides</em>), mangroves, oysterbeds and mussel farms (Aylesworth <em>et al</em>. 2016). One study has examined planktonic juveniles of the species that range in size from 6.0–65.3 mm (standard length) (Kanou and Kohno 2001). These juveniles were found in plankton tows from May–January. Young from 15–34 mm SL showed high gut fullness and had consumed small crustacean prey including <em>Oithona davisae</em> and <em>Penilia avirostris</em>. In contrast, large planktonic individuals ≥35 mm showed low gut fullness, preying on larger but less abundant prey items such as species of <em>Brachyura</em>. As in other seahorses, <em>H. mohnikei</em> is ovoviviparous, and males brood the embryos in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). &#160;Their breeding season appears to occur from May to September in the Japanese portion of their range (Otsuka <em>et al</em>. 2009).","<em>Hippocampus mohnikei</em> is threatened by overexploitation (through targeted catch and as bycatch) and seagrass and mangrove habitat loss as a result of coastal development and pollution, destructive fishing practices such as trawling and the use of dynamite, and the effects of climate change including increased sea surface temperatures and frequency of storms (Waycott <em>et al. </em>2009, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010, Short <em>et al.</em> 2011, Aylesworth <em>et al.</em> 2016).

It&#160;can be found in relatively deep waters, with a maximum recorded depth of 152m (Choo and Liew 2003, Lourie <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2016). Little is known about feeding, but this species likely consumes small   benthic and/or planktonic crustaceans such as harpacticoid and cyclopoid   copepods, gammarid shrimps, and mysids (Woods<em> et al.</em> 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos <em>et al. </em>2008, Yip<em> et al. </em>2015, Valladares <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Seahorses including <em>H. kelloggi </em>are ovoviviparous and the males give birth to live young (Foster and Vincent 2004). All seahorse species have vital parental care, and many species studied to date have high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002, Foster and Vincent 2004), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al.</em> 1999)- these traits make seahorses vulnerable to over-exploitation. They also have some traits, such as small body size, fast growth and high fecundity, that may confer resilience to high levels of exploitation (Morgan 2007). However, a specialised life-history coupled with a dependence on habitats that are subject to extremely high fishing pressure, and the fact that seahorses do not move very much and are thus easily captured, means they are very vulnerable to over-exploitation (Foster and Vincent 2004).","<em>Hipocampus kelloggi</em> is threatened from bycatch in multiple artisanal as well as commercial fisheries throughout its range and this is the major threat facing this species (McPherson and Vincent 2004, Meeuwig <em>et al. </em>2006, Murugan <em>et al. </em>2008, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Even though small numbers are caught per unit of effort, the number of individuals taken is substantial (Lawson <em>et al. </em>2017). The species may also be targeted for use in the aquarium trade (Vincent <em>et al</em>. 2011). Destructive fishing practices such as dynamite fishing and trawling also threaten the species' habitat (Vincent <em>et al.</em> 2011<em>). </em>Seahorses' life history and ecological traits may increase their susceptibility to these threats.","As <em>Hippocampus kelloggi</em> is relatively wide-spread (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2016), it is difficult to accurately assess the global population trend for this species. There is evidence from trade research across its range of declines in the availability of seahorses due to extensive exploitation (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2004, Meeuwig <em>et al. </em>2006, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Even though some countries within the range of <em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;restrict or ban the trade in wild specimens, illegal trade is reported to occur (UNEP-WCMC 2012b).<br/><br/>Historically, surveys in 2000 in East Africa reported trade in&#160;<em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;(among other species) and that fishers and traders noted that the availability and size of seahorses in the area were declining (McPherson and Vincent 2004). The fishers and traders attributed these declines to their capture in non-selective fishing gear and destructive fishing methods such as dynamite fishing (McPherson and Vincent 2004, UNEP-WCMC 2012b). In Thailand, fishers and traders reported trade in&#160;<em>H. kelloggi </em>in 1998 and 1999, that the majority of seahorses were landed as trawl bycatch and that the availability of seahorses was decreasing (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). If the reported declines are extrapolated to 2016, seahorses have  declined by approximately 58% in Malaysia, 56-88% in Thailand (Perry et  al. 2010), and 65% in the Philippines (O'Donnell <em>et al. 2</em>010).<br/><br/><em>Hippocampus kelloggi </em>is one of the five most reported species in international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2012a, Foster 2016). All <em>Hippocampus</em> species are listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This means that countries who are signatories to CITES are subject to regulations on the export of seahorses.&#160;<em>H. kelloggi&#160;</em>was selected for review of significant trade at the 24th CITES Animals Committee due to large and potentially unregulated numbers of&#160;in international trade (UNEP-WCMC 2012b). This review revealed that in China,&#160;<em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;was once the most commonly caught species but currently populations are considered to be depleted and the species is listed nationally as Endangered. Also, declines in&#160;<em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;were reported in India, the Philippines, United Republic of Tanzania and Vietnam&#160;(as cited in UNEP-WCMC 2012b).<br/><br/>Although not quantified, most fishers interviewed in this species' range  states reported declines that were at times substantial between 1995  and 2000 (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017). Although these declines were  prior to the current 10 year time frame over which the species is being  assessed, fishing and especially trawling pressure has increased  substantially across this species' range in the past decade.<br/><br/><em></em>Although it is difficult to estimate the rate of decline of this species, it is clear that throughout its range <em>H. kelloggi </em>is under severe pressure. This species has been observed in trade throughout its range since the mid to late 1990's with seahorses primarily landed as trawl bycatch (Vincent 1996, &#160;McPherson and Vincent 2004, Murugan <em>et al. </em>2008, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010). Legal and illegal trade in this species is ongoing (UNEP-WCMC 2012a,b).<br/><br/>Overall, due to previous declines of seahorses in general reported by fishers, intensification  of the fisheries across most of the species' range, and habitat degradation and loss, it is  suspected that declines of at least 30% in the Great Seahorse have  occurred over the past 10 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus kelloggi</em> has a relatively wide range throughout much of the Indo-Pacific. It has been recorded from Zanzibar in Tanzania, Pakistan, India, and southeast Asia, north to China and Japan and southwest to Queensland and Vanuatu in Australia (Lourie<em> et al.</em> 2016, Jeff Leis <em>in litt.</em> to Riley Pollom 26 January 2017). This species has a suspected distribution including the east coast of Africa (North of Zanzibar), the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman (Lourie <em>et al. </em>2004, 2016).","<em>Hippocampus kelloggi</em>&#160;is traded both live for the aquarium trade as well as dried, for use in traditional medicine <em></em>(Vincent <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;This species is large, pale and smooth which are all traits that have been shown to be sought after for traditional Chinese medicine (Vincent 1996).<em><br/><br/>Hippocampus kelloggi</em> is one of the top five species reported to CITES as being traded internationally, with reported trade volumes averaging over one million individuals per annum from 2004-2008 (Evanson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Given that a large proportion of the trade reported to CITES is only reported to the genus level, it is possible this volume underestimates the true extent of trade in this species (Foster 2016). Trade reported to CITES suggested that the majority of trade in <em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;originated in East Asian countries and from wild populations (UNEP-WCMC 2012a, Foster 2016). The majority of seahorses found in international trade have been landed as bycatch in non-target fisheries&#160;(Foster and Vincent 2004, Vincent&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, and this is true for <em>H. kelloggi </em>(McPherson and Vincent 2004, Meuuwig <em>et al. </em>2006, Perry <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>Legal and illegal trade in <em>H. kelloggi </em>is reported to occur elsewhere in its range, in addition to East Asia.&#160;Surveys in 2000 in East Africa reported trade in&#160;<em>H. kelloggi</em>&#160;(among other species), and found that the availability and size of seahorses in the area were declining (McPherson and Vincent 2004, UNEP-WCMC 2012b). Historically, India was one of the largest sources of seahorses for international trade, and this trade included&#160;<em>H. kelloggi&#160;</em>(Murugan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, Sreepada&#160;<em>et al.</em>2002). This trade is reported to continue illegally in spite of a ban on seahorse trade enacted in 2001 (Indian Ministry of Environments and Forests 2001, Murugan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Salin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, UNEP-WCMC 2012b). Trade in this species was also recorded in Thailand as early as 1998 and 1999, and this trade reportedly continues in large volumes (Perry <em>et al. </em>2010, UNEP-WCMC 2012a,b).<br/><br/>Australian populations have been protected under the Australian Wildlife Protection Act since 1998 and the species is also listed under wildlife protection laws in the People's Republic of China (Lourie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004), which is meant to prevents trade. Syngnathids have been listed on Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act as of 2001 and export of these species is therefore prohibited (Indian Ministry of Environments and Forests 2001). There is also a national ban on the capture and trade of seahorse in the Philippines as of 2004 (Philippine Department of Agriculture 1998), but illegal fishing has been reported (O'Donnel <em>et al. </em>2010).",Marine,"Along with all other seahorses, <em>Hippocampus kelloggi </em>is listed on Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade is regulated and that countries can be required to prove that their exports are sustainable through non-detriment findings (NDFs) if there is concern. The species is likely to occur in several protected areas given its large range.&#160; <br/><em><em><br/></em></em>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The major habitats occupied by the species include seagrasses, macroalgae, and sheltered areas with sessile invertabrates. The species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss from coastal development and destructive fishing practices, targeted exploitation, and by being caught extensively as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. Based on declining habitat quality, extent of occurrence, and declines reported by fishers, it is inferred that the population has undergone a decline of at least 30%.

58303674,39375,Carcharhinus melanopterus,Vulnerable,A2bcd,2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus melanopterus</em>) is a medium-sized (to at least 180 cm TL) coastal shark that occurs in coral reef and associated habitats in tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the surface down to a depth of at least 75 m. The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries through much of its range in gears including longline, gillnet, handline and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth, and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in the habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 51.2% over three generation lengths (44 years), but this is likely an over-estimate because of complex spatial and ecological factors that affect the abundance of this species. Therefore, the Blacktip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation  and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Blacktip Reef Shark is a coastal species that is common in shallow water on and near coral reefs, where it occurs from the surface to depths of at least 75 m. It is often associated with coral reefs, but in many locations the young  use mangrove systems early in life if they are available (Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm total length (TL) and maturity is reached between 90 and 134 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Stevens 1984, Last and Stevens 2009, Chin <em>et al.</em> 2013b).&#160;Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 2–4 pups (Compagno 1984, Lyle 1987, Last and Stevens 2009), a biennial reproductive cycle (Stevens 1984) and a size-at-birth of 30–50 cm TL (Mourier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Great Barrier Reef males mature at 4.2 years and females at 8.5 years. Longevity of field sampled individuals was estimated as 15 years, but this is known to be an underestimation due to limitations in age estimation methods, and captive animals have lived for over 25 years (Chin<em> et al</em>. 2013b); using these age data the generation length is estimated to be between 12–17 years (average of 14.5 years).","The Blacktip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small scale longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in continental shelf waters and those around oceanic islands and reefs, especially those around coral reefs. Most are taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. For example, in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef it makes up 1.1% of shark catch in inshore gillnets (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and 5% of sharks caught in the line fishery for reef teleosts (Heupel <em>et al. </em>2009). In Indonesia it makes up 0.3% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Blacktip Reef Shark makes up more than half of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. There is limited species-specific catch trend data available for most countries, however, throughout much of the species' range there are intensive coastal fisheries that are likely to exert significant pressure on the stocks. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and the effort continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2012), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.<br/><br/>This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","Genetic studies support the presence of multiple subpopulations throughout its range, with structure detected between and within island groups in the Pacific (Vingnaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). How many subpopulations exist is currently unknown because of limited sampling of most locations.<br/><br/>The Blacktip Reef Shark in common in tropical and subtropical waters but there is little data available on population status and trends. Severe localized depletions in reef sharks, that include the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been recorded from the Indian Ocean (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on diving survey data, Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks in the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 sharks per dive in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a population reduction of 94% over three generations (44 years). Species-specific data were available for the period between 1996 and 2006 and showed a decline in the Blacktip Reef Shark to a level where it was rarely encountered in 2006 (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Towed-diver surveys performed in the&#160;Western Central Pacific&#160;between 2004 and 2010&#160;showed that reef shark densities are higher at remote locations with very limited or no human presence&#160;(Nadon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Based on a modelling approach, they estimated that reef sharks (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) in this region&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">have declined to 3–10% of baseline levels, with baseline considered absence of humans (Nadon&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2012)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Approximately 6% of all the sharks recorded during towed surveys (4,620 sharks) were the Blacktip Reef Shark, which was not present at all sites.&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Based on this information it is suspected that reef shark populations, including the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been reduced in the Western Central Pacific, particularly in islands such as the Hawaiian Main Island, Mariana Islands, and Samoa that have high human population densities (Chin <em>et al.</em> 2011, <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Nadon <em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2012)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Given the high level of population structuring in this species, localised studies are unlikely to provide a good indication of overall population trend. In many parts of south and east Asia (e.g. Sri Lanka, Myanmar) this is the only reef shark species that remains, following the loss of species such as the Grey Reef Shark and Whitetip Reef Shark, suggesting that population declines are not as severe as reported for these other species.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">To account for differences in the trend of Blacktip Reef Shark between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed using data from the Global Finprint project (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020)&#160; that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to total global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Blacktip Reef Sharks was estimated as 51.2% (standard error 43.3–59.6%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (44 years) (see Supplementary Information). The error estimates include both the IUCN Red List Vulnerable and Endangered categories. However, the ability of the Global Finprint data to estimate depletion for this species is limited by complex ecological patterns not accounted for in the methodology. As a result it over-estimates the level of decline at some reefs where population levels are thought to be healthy. As such, it is estimated that the Blacktip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Blacktip Reef Shark&#160;is a common tropical Indo-West Pacific and central Pacific species occurring from Africa to Central Pacific, including most of the islands with coral reefs (Compagno 1984, Last and Stevens 2009).

There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2020). MPAs are common in coral reef areas of many range states throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire EEZs, provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;On the Queensland east coast (including the Great Barrier Reef), shark catch (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) is managed through a limited entry license fishery with a maximum annual total allowable catch of 600 tonnes (whole weight, for all shark species combined).

It ranges from the Persian/Arabian Gulf westwards through Southeast Asia and north to Japan. It is replaced by the recently described Blue-banded Eagle Ray (<em>A. caeruleofasciatus</em>) in northern Australia and southern New Guinea, and therefore its distribution is smaller than previously reported.<br/><br/>The species occurs on the continental shelf to a depth of 115 m. Its preference for inshore habitats and the fact that it is apparently uncommon, makes it particularly vulnerable to widespread and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution. Levels of exploitation are very high throughout its range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean, hence it is under a severe level of threat within most of this range. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of batoids are reported to be declining in areas of Southeast Asia for which information is available, with fishermen having to travel further and further to sustain catch levels. Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range where the species is caught&#160;in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays,&#160;the level of decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations) and exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, and the species is assessed as Vulnerable.","The Banded Eagle Ray is a demersal species on the continental shelf inshore to at least 115 m (Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of at least 72 cm disc width (DW); born at 17 cm disc width (DW); viviparous with litters of up to four young (Compagno and Last 1999, Last and Stevens 2009). Nothing else is known of this species' biology. Generation length estimated at 10 years based on the generation length of the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) (14.5 years)&#160;(Martin and Cailliet 1988). However, the Bat Ray is a considerably larger species (reaching 180 cm DW) than the Banded Eagle Ray.","This species is a major commercial eagle ray that is marketed throughout the region. Declines in this species are inferred based on high levels of exploitation in the coastal zone across its range. It is landed where taken, for example in intense and generally unregulated fisheries in Indonesia (White and Dharmadi 2007). It was previously more common in Thai fish markets; batoids have declined considerably in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979). See the <em>Population </em>section for more detail.","<p>The Banded Eagle Ray is believed to be a naturally rare species.&#160;</p><p>Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Banded Eagle Ray&#160;in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.</em> 2010).</span></p>",Decreasing,"The Banded Eagle Ray<em>&#160;</em>is an Indo-West Pacific species, ranging from the Persian/Arabian Gulf westwards to Indonesia and Southeast Asia and northwards to southern Japan.&#160;There are single records from the Maldives and from southern Mozambique, indicating that the species may have a wider distribution in the Indian Ocean than currently known.

The area adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone in Indonesian waters is entirely unmanaged, with fishing vessels operating out of eastern Indonesia and there appears to be more activity in this area than was previously thought. About 650 large Thai pair trawlers operate in the Arafura Sea from the port of Merauke in West Papua. This fishery is unregulated and batoids compose a substantial portion of the catch, all of which is retained and marketed. Batoids are heavily fished in Indonesia, with catches and effort increasing (see White and Dharmadi 2007).

Habitat degradation and loss due to urban development pressure (including large-scale port and airport reclamation projects) in Moreton Bay, the core part of the species' distribution, has affected inshore habitat.<br/><br/>Colclough's Shark is assessed as Vulnerable on account of a suspected continuing decline and a small population size (estimated to be &lt;10,000 mature individuals) that is subject to a number of threatening processes. Fully protected zones within Moreton Bay Marine Park (15% of Moreton Bay) are likely to be critical for the conservation of the species.","Colclough's Shark occurs in inshore waters of &lt;4 m depth out to 217 m (mostly &lt;100 m) (Compagno 2001, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2011).

This species reaches a maximum size of 85 cm total length (TL) with females mature from 54.5 cm TL and males from 61 cm TL; size at birth possibly ~17-19 cm TL (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2011). Lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 6-7 (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2011).

These include reclamation projects for the Brisbane Airport and the Port of Brisbane.","This is a rare species. Given its restricted distribution, it is assumed that all individuals belong to the one continuous population. Currently it is known from only 50 records in one location, despite its distribution being well surveyed and researched (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2011).

The biology and ecology of the species is poorly-known, but it is thought to have moderate productivity like other medium-sized carcharhinids. It is rarely targeted and mainly taken as bycatch and comprises only small proportions of catches in commercial and small-scale gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. Within Australian waters the fisheries that take the Graceful Shark are well managed, but through the rest of its range, management of shark populations is mostly lacking. We can infer that given its medium-size, and presence in coastal waters of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean where coastal fishing is intensive and extensive, it is likely threatened. Based on ongoing declines in species of similar life histories and catchability in fisheries, the Graceful Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Graceful Shark is demersal and pelagic and occurs inshore on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 50 m (Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 178 cm total length (TL), males mature at 140 cm TL and females mature at 167 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk sac placenta with litter sizes of 1–9 pups, an annual reproductive cycle (9–10 months gestation) and size-at-birth of 50–60 cm TL (Stevens and McLoughlin 1991). There is no age estimate for this species and the only data available are from the sister species, the Australian Blacktip Shark, which has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and maximum age estimated at 15 years (Harry <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013), resulting in a generation length of 11 years.","The Graceful Shark is rarely targeted and taken mainly as bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries throughout its range, and is retained for its meat and fins. Records of Graceful Shark catches in most countries are scant. Keong (1996) reported its occurrence in fish markets in Thailand. Catches are noted by commercial fisheries in India and Sri Lanka (Compagno 1984), Bangladesh (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2019), Myanmar (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015), Indonesia (White 2007), and Malaysia. Jabado <em>et al</em>. (2015) reported that the Graceful Shark makes up about 1% of shark catch in the Gulf. Moore <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported that this species is also taken in small numbers in fisheries in Qatar and Kuwait. While available data in other countries are limited, we can infer that because heavy, often unmanaged, fishing pressure persists in coastal Indo-West Pacific waters, and because other medium-bodied shallow-water shark species are threatened with extinction due to overfishing (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014), the same is likely true for the Graceful Shark.<br/><br/>In northern Australia, it is currently caught in coastal gillnet fisheries targeting Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>), Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polydactylus macrochir</em>), mackerel (Scombridae spp.), and sharks in northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019), but never in large quantities. Harry <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that off the Queensland east coast, it makes up about 0.3% of the catch in the inshore gillnet fishery. Previously, it was reported to make up 1.5% of the shark catch by number and 2.7% by weight in coastal gillnets and 0.2% of the shark catch by number and 0.6% by weight in longlines in the Northern Territory (Lyle and Timms 1984, Lyle and Griffin 1987). However, catch levels during the 1970s and 1980s were considerably higher when foreign gillnet vessels operated in northern Australian waters; the actual numbers of Graceful Shark captured were limited, but catches were higher as effort was also higher. Foreign vessels caught up to 17,000 t of sharks annually during this period (Bentley 1996), but ceased fishing in Australian waters in 1986 when the length of gillnets was restricted.<br/><br/>This species’ presence in mangroves habitats means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in parts of its range. For e.g., across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p></p>","This species is often confused with the Blacktip Shark (<em>Carcharhinus limbatus</em>) and the Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C. tilstoni</em>) with which it is both genetically and morphologically similar (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is also sometimes confused with the Pigeye Shark (<em>C. amboinensis</em>) (Tillett <em>et al</em>. 2012). These identification issues may mean that its importance in fisheries catches is underestimated. It may also explain why it is rarely reported in much of its range. <br/><br/>In northern Australia, it was caught in limited numbers in the Taiwanese gillnet fisheries that operated until the mid-1980s (Stevens and McLoughlin 1991). The closely related Blacktip Shark and Australian Blacktip Shark have both recovered from historic declines that resulted from the Taiwanese gillnet fishery (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018), providing evidence that the current Australian fishing pressure since the mid-1980s is low. Given the relatively small current catches of the Graceful Shark in Australian waters, it is suspected that the population decline of the Graceful Shark is low in Australia over the past three generation lengths (33 years).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, there is no species-specific population trend data, although trends can be inferred from other medium-sized carcharhinids and from reconstructed catches based on landings data. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The majority of the Graceful Shark’s range falls within a region where coastal fishing has been intensive over a long period of time. Its inshore, coastal distribution means that it has no refuge from this high intensity fishing pressure. Throughout its range, other medium-sized carcharhinid species that also inhabit the coastal zone have declined substantially (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, IUCN 2020).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, reconstructed catch data for the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shows carcharhinids increased throughout the mid- to late-1900s. In Eastern Indonesia, the carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before it rapidly decreased ~325% in the mid-1990s to 11,500 t; catch has remained relatively stable since (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s before reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000 t and 17,500 t until 2004. After which, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600 t and 14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian EEZ of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960s and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort.<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed catches of carcharhinids in the east increased at a relatively stable rate beginning in the 1950s to 2014 with catch of ~4,500 t. In the west, carcharhinid catch sharply increased in the early 1960s from under 1,000 t per year to ~6,500 t by the late 1970s. Catch has since decreased sharply and has been under 2,000 t per year since 2010 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Borneo, carcharhinid landings increased in Sarawak throughout the 1950s and sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t. They then decreased to 4–5,000 t throughout the 1980s before increasing to 7,400 t again in 1997 and then decreasing to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sabah, landings of carcharhinids slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1980s before steeply increasing to 14,800 t in 1995 and then decreasing to 9,400 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates for the EEZ from 1950 to 2014 showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (33 years) of the Graceful Shark they represent declines of 39%, 72%, 88%, 54%, and 98% in the Indonesian EEZ of the Indian Ocean, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, Sabah, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Graceful Shark. In Kuwait, it makes up less than 0.5% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore et al. 2012). In the United Arab Emirates, it makes up 0.7% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015) and 0.3% of sharks traded from Oman by number (Jabado et al. 2015). The species is not recorded from Bahrain (Moore and Peirce 2013), and in Iran it is uncommon but does occasionally occur in landings (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2016). In Oman, only one specimen of this species was recorded from extensive market surveys (Henderson and Reeve 2014). In Pakistan, this species was frequently caught prior to 1999, but since is suspected to have declined by 70% (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017). In India, it is captured in fisheries, but it is often aggregated with Blacktip Shark and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna</em>) making estimates of its importance difficult (K.V. Akhilesh unpubl. data 2017). However, Raje <em>et al</em>. (2007) report landings of 73 t from the northwest coast and 36 t from the southwest coast in 2003–2004. Furthermore, data from Maharashtra in 2003 and 2005 indicate that approximately 10 t were landed (Raje et al. 2015). It is caught in small numbers in Sri Lanka, but additional information is not available (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across nearly the entire spatial and depth range of the Graceful Shark. The Graceful Shark has refuge from intensive fishing in northern Australia where fisheries pressure is low and fisheries are well managed. Overall, it is difficult to determine levels of population reduction given the confusion with similar species, however where data is available, the Graceful Shark comprises only a small proportion of the commercial catches. It is likely to have moderate productivity like other medium-sized carcharhinids and based on declines in species of similar life histories and catchability in fisheries, it is suspected that the Graceful Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (33 years), due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Graceful Shark occurs in the tropical Indo-West Pacific, from Australia to Somalia (Compagno 1984, Parry-Jones 1996, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Distribution records are not continuous; however, given its relatively low abundance, and morphological similarity to other more abundant species of the genus <em>Carcharhinus</em>, its range is likely to be continuous through southern Asia, as far as Somalia, but not within the Red Sea (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).","The Graceful Shark is retained for its meat and fins. Fields <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported that this species, in combination with other blacktip shark species, accounts for 4.1% of the fins traded in Hong Kong. However, the proportional contribution of the Graceful Shark within this group was unknown.",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation or management measures in place for this species. In northern Australia, shark fisheries are well regulated with limited entry, catch or effort limits, gear restrictions, anti-finning regulations, and size limits. Throughout much of the rest of its range there are few effective regulations that limit the take of this species. Several nations within its range have general regulations that apply to sharks, and the numerous marine protected areas throughout its range may provide some benefit to the species. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global
68613628,41738,Carcharhinus sealei,Vulnerable,A2d,2021,2020-05-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blackspot Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sealei</em>) is a small (to 95 cm total length) requiem shark distributed through the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) and Indo-Malay peninsula ranging from Myanmar to the Philippines in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans. It occurs inshore on insular and continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 40 m. This species is subject to intense commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its geographic and depth range. It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal trawls and gillnets. This species is used for its fins and meat but is of limited value due to its small size. Reconstructed catches of all requiem sharks, combined from the Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea, infer a population reduction of 44% over three generation lengths (24 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The likely relatively short generation length may provide the Blackspot Shark some resilience to fishing pressure, however, there are signs of declines and potential disappearance in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and eastern Indonesia. It is suspected that the Blackspot Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed Vulnerable A2d.<br/><p></p>","<p></p>The Blackspot Shark&#160;occurs inshore on insular and continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 40 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 95 cm total length (TL); males mature at 70–80 cm TL and females mature at 68–75 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk sac placenta, litter sizes of 1–2 pups born after a nine-month gestation and presumably an annual reproductive cycle, and a size–at–birth of 33–36 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is no age estimate for this species and the only data are available from the sister species, the Australian Blackspot Shark (<em>C. coatesi</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 5 years and maximum age estimated at 11&#160;years (Baje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), resulting in a generation length of 8 years.<p></p>","Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets.<br/><br/>In the Andaman Islands, this species is commonly caught in trawls, longlines, gillnets and landed daily with up to 20–30 individuals landed per boat and an estimated total catch of 500­–700 individuals per year (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Myanmar, it is occasionally captured in the southern part of the country and was recorded in a research survey in 2017 (Psamadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is fished through the Malacca Strait, Java Sea, and northwestern Kalimantan and most of the catch is taken with gillnets (55%) and longlines and tanglenets (45%), and possibly baby-trawls (Last et al. 2010, R. Yuneni unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited, and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, this species is regularly landed; it is captured as trawl bycatch in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and common in gillnets and trawls in Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Across Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species was likely taken in inshore fisheries that operate at depths of 5–20 m and use demersal longlines (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh et al. 2014, FAO 2020a). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3 Gross Tonnage (Palomares et al. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009).","There are no species-specific time-series available. In Malaysia, the Blackspot Shark is among the top ten most commonly taken species in Malaysia; it is commonly observed at markets in peninsular Malaysia and is less common in Sabah and Sarawak (SEAFDEC 2016, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, reconstructed catches of related species are available at the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale, i.e., Carcharhinidae, <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius</em> <em>ferrugineus</em>), and Triakidae (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The aggregate catch of these closely related species are available from LMEs 35–38 (i.e., Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea). Catch levels of these species grew rapidly through the 1970s to a peak of 63,186 t in 1989. Catch then declined to 32,822 t in 2016 representing a 48% decline over 27 years (Pauly <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2020). These declines equate to a population reduction of 44% over three generation lengths (24 years) of the Blackspot Shark. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>The likely relatively short generation length of the Blackspot Shark may provide it some resilience to fishing pressure, however, there are signs of declines and potential disappearance of the species in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and eastern Indonesia.

This species was formerly thought to be more widely distributed ranging from South Africa to China, however, it is easily confused with the other four members of the <em>C. sealei</em>–<em>dussumieri </em>group and any records further west of the known range require validation (White 2012).","This species is used for its fins and meat but is of limited value due to its small size (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010).

In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). There are no marine protected areas (MPAs) in their Indonesian distribution (CTI 2020).

The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years).

Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, fecundity is very low, with two pups per litter every two years, and size-at-birth estimated at 35–37 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, Harrison's Dogfish (<em>Centrophorus harrissoni</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 23 years and a maximum age of 36 years, resulting in a generation length of 29.5 years (Whitley 2004).</p>","<p>Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp) have been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries.<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Off Western Australia, a targeted gillnet fishery for deep-water dogfish (mainly <em>Centrophorus</em> spp) operated between 1996–1999; the fishery ceased after three years due to rapid declines in catch (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;<a>A&#160;semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced off the eastern coast of Australia and the south coast of Western Australia between&#160;Cape Leeuwin and&#160;Albany&#160;where the species occurs (T. Walker unpubl. data 2019). Also, the species now has refuge along much of the west coast of Australia where only three&#160;trawlers were active during the 2017‒2018&#160;fishing season (Mazloumi <em>et al. </em>2019), as well as&#160;</a>off the west Pacific Islands where there are no known deep-water fisheries.<br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Targeting gulper shark fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). <br/><br/>A number of deep-water demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to 1968, operate in the Southwest Indian Ocean (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). These fisheries target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Fishing pressure in this region is expected to continue; in 2017, the fishery in Madagascar intensified from 2 to 12 Chinese deep-water trawlers in 2017 without any known management measures (R. Bennett pers. comm. 25/4/2018). Bycatch is recognised as making up a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p>","Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown.&#160;Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of gulper sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Species-specific population trend data of relative abundance is available from southeast Australia (Walker and Gason 2007). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths (89 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/>The trend analysis&#160;of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates from research trawl surveys between 1998–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007), revealed an annual rate decline of 2.4%, consistent with an estimated reduction of 88.5% over three generation lengths (89 years), with the highest probability (58%) of &gt;80% reduction in population over three generation lengths.&#160;This accounts for only a small proportion (&lt;10%) of the species known range.&#160;In addition, significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of the Endeavour Dogfish from 1976 to 77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, were documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Catches of the species were reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean annual catch estimate of 30 t between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).&#160; <br/><br/>Elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, the species was the most recorded&#160;<em>Centrophorus </em>spp from fishing landing site across Indonesia between 2001–2006 (White and Dharmadi<em>&#160;</em>2010). Total catch of dogfishes, a mixed category for more than 10 species, reported to the Indonesian&#160;National Shark Data Collection program&#160;decreased from&#160;16,536 t in 2005 to 4,820 t in 2016&#160;(DGCF, 2017). This equates to&#160;&gt;80% reduction in population over three generation lengths. Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp was found to decline from 18% to 1–14% between 1984 and 2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004).<br/><br/>In the Northwest Pacific, annual exports of shark liver oil from the Philippines peaked at 336 t in 1980 to 45 t in 1993. The fishery includes a number of shark species, including unidentified <em>Centrophorus</em> spp (BFAR 2017).&#160;In Japan, the Endeavour Dogfish CPUE (numbers of sharks/100 hooks) in Okinawa waters ranged from 0.04–1.48 from 1983 to 1986 (Yano and Kugai 1993), indicating a stable population during that time.&#160;Research surveys in 2006–2012 reported a slightly higher average CPUE (numbers of sharks/100 hooks) for the&#160;Endeavour Dogfish&#160;of 0.04 (Uehara&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013), suggesting little change in the population abundance from 1983 to 2012.<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Endeavour&#160;Dogfish&#160;was estimated and suspected to be declining in parts of its range (southeast Australia, Indonesia, Philippines, Andaman Islands) and suspected to be stable in Japan. The <span lang=""EN-GB"">species has refuge across part of Western Australia and off Northeast Australia, and<span lang=""EN-GB"">&#160;off the west Pacific Islands where there are no known deep-water fisheries.&#160;Due to inferred declines in parts of the Indo-Pacific and high levels of exploitation balanced with refuge in other parts of its distribution, a global population reduction of 30–49% was estimated over three generation lengths (89 years).

The Roughskin Dogfish is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline (surface and benthic) fisheries across its range. The species has been reported under a generic code in many regions, or misidentified with other&#160;<em>Centroscymnus&#160;</em>species, including the Portuguese Dogfish (<em>C. coelolepis</em>). At this time, there are some species-specific management actions in place for the Roughskin Dogfish in part of its range. Fisheries closures and restrictions in the Tasman Sea may indirectly offer this species some refuge, but mitigation for deepwater dogfish in the Northeast Atlantic, where fishing effort is high, do not cease the capture of this species as bycatch.<br/><br/>This is a low productivity species, and based on current levels of exploitation, it is inferred that&#160;the global population has declined by at least 30% over the past three generations (90 years) given actual levels of exploitation in core areas of its range, particularly the Northeast Atlantic, New Zealand and Australia. This species is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The Roughskin Dogfish is recorded on continental slopes, oceanic ridges, and seamounts at depths of 150-1,458 m, but is most common at depths &gt;600 m (Blackwell 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 120 cm total length (TL); males mature at 67-84 cm TL; females mature at 95-104 cm TL; size at birth 25-30 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous and is presumed to be asynchronous; litter size is 5-34 pups (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Generation length is estimated to be 30 years (Irvine 2004).<br/></p>","The Roughskin Dogfish is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline (surface and benthic) fisheries across its range (Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015, Compagno 2016). This species is strongly associated with seamounts (Tracey <em>et al</em>. 2004), potentially increasing its susceptibility to capture.<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). This species, and other smallspine sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) were previously targeted in mid-slope (650-1,200 m) deepwater shark fisheries (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Northeast Atlantic, deepwater dogfish are taken as bycatch in multi-species deepwater trawl, hook, and gillnet fisheries that target other species with high Total Allowable Catches (TACs) (Dureuil and Jung 2015), and it is likely that this species is also captured. A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species moderate risk from commercial fishing (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from commercial fishing (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across its range, it has been documented that the Roughskin Dogfish has been reported under a generic code (Blackwell 2010), or misidentified with other <em>Centroscymnus </em>species, including the Portuguese Dogfish (<em>C. coelolepis</em>) (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ebert 2015). The Portguese Dogfish represented the majority of deepwater shark in some European fisheries, including Portugal (Figueiredo and Machado 2005), before targeted deepwater shark fishing was prohibited in the EU (ICES 2016). These factors are likely to underestimate catches of the Roughskin Dogfish. Any discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The Roughskin Dogfish is also reported from Eastern Central Atlantic benthic trawl and tuna longline fisheries, however, further information is not available for catches of this species (Compagno 2016). As fisheries expand further into deeper water, it is likely that the Roughskin Dogfish will be at risk of future population declines in other parts of its distribution.","Population size and trends for this species are unknown across most of its range. Some of its known range is confirmed only from a few reported specimens, and thus, any estimation of population trends from these areas cannot be reported at this time. There is however some information from Australia and New Zealand in the Southwest Pacific and from the Northeast Atlantic.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific</strong><br/>In New Zealand, the species is considered to have a large population size (based on the number of records in commercial, observer and research trawl databases in the New Zealand EEZ; Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). Abundance indices for New Zealand on Chatham Rise (1992-2010) and the Sub-Antarctic (1991-1993, 2000-2009) are poorly estimated and show no clear trends (O’Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011, Bagley <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Australia, the Roughskin Dogfish has been considered to be common in abundance (Walker and Gason 2007). However, over a 20 year period (1976/77-1996/97), substantial declines (in some cases &gt;90%) of relative abundance of deepwater chondrichthyans in the Australian South East Fishery trawl grounds have been documented (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). Roughskin Dogfish declined by ~90% over 11 years (1996-2006, standardized CPUE) (Walker and Gason 2007), which would equate to a decline of &gt;99% over three generations (90 years).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, other deepwater dogfish have been estimated to have undergone population declines of &gt;80% over three generations (Dureuil and Jung 2015, Guallart <em>et al</em>. 2015). Where survey catch data are available, data have shown patterns of high initial catch rates, followed by rapid declines (Dureuil and Jung 2015), highlighting the susceptibility of deepwater dogfish to over-exploitation.<br/><br/>With the information provided, it is inferred that the Roughskin Dogfish has sustained population declines of at least 30% over three generations (90 years) based on levels of exploitation (i.e. bycatch).",Unknown,"<p>The Roughskin Dogfish is known from a patchy yet widespread distribution in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2013, Weigmann 2016).</span></p>","The Roughskin Dogfish is utilized for its flesh and squalene oil, and is also used for fishmeal (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2015, Compagno 2016).

Some management arrangements in New Zealand, Australia, and the Northeast Atlantic are relevant to this species.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific<br/></strong>New Zealand has had a Quota Management System (QMS) in place since 1986 to provide for the sustainable management of its fisheries. The Roughskin Dogfish is a non-QMS species, meaning that there is no species-specific management in place for the species (MPI 2013). New Zealand has a system of Benthic Protected Areas (BPAs), however they are unlikely to provide any major refuge for this species given the spatial occurrence of the BPAs (see Black and Tilney 2015). In Australia, catches of Roughskin Dogfish are controlled by basket trip limits to prevent targeted fishing (Walker and Gason 2007). A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2016), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deepwater sharks in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES 2016). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deepwater shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius </em>spp.) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deepwater fishing in 2010 (ICES 2016).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Bottom trawl fishing effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. obs.). Chimaeras are caught by set net, dropline, or demersal trawl and are often discarded at sea or landed. The Silver Chimaera is commonly observed as landed catch from trawl fisheries in the East China Sea (A.&#160;Yamaguchi, unpubl. data), where fishing intensity is high (Szuwalski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). If the species is caught in a high enough quantity to fill catch boxes it is often retained and landed; if smaller numbers are caught it is more regularly discarded. Retention also depends on catches of other species as meat of the Silver Chimaera is considered of lower quality than other chondrichthyans such as skates.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884734"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and into distant waters.

Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture&#160;where demand is high (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).</p><p>In the Philippines, fishing of other deep-water chondrichthyans dates back to the 1960s (Flores 2004).

In Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>) fisheries (Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated; on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported in logbooks (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).

Bycatch is recognized as making up a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have also been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Longsnout Dogfish to have high to extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline fisheries in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018). A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current commercial fishing as fishing effort has reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth (T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In New Zealand, the&#160;Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>) is one of the most reported deep-water shark species from offshore deep-water fisheries, however, the Longsnout Dogfish is very infrequently reported (Francis 2015). It is likely to be more abundant than currently reported but taxonomic resolution of&#160;<em>Deania </em>spp is required (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/><a>Over the past 30 years in Taiwan, the deep-water trawl fishery has moved to deeper waters of 300–700 m for most of the year and would encounter this species. However, there is some refuge at depths beyond 700 m and during the monsoon season when the fishery effort is directed at shallow depths. There has been a noted increase in landing rates in Taiwan since 2013, that could partly be accounted for by the increased fishing depth, although that has been occurring for the past 30 years with the increase in landings only noted in the past six years, and improvements in reporting can not be ruled out. Any&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).</a></p>","<p>Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. In Australia, from 1976 to 77 to 1996–97, catches of the species by fishery-independent surveys declined from 11.0 to 1.4 kg/h on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia (Graham&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001), equating to a reduction of ~87% over the past three generations (90 years).&#160;Catches of Longsnout Dogfish&#160;were occasionally reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean annual catch estimate of ~4 t between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007). In New Zealand, an indicator analysis for the related Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>)&#160;showed no trends in abundance (Francis<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s (Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 65% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (90 years) for the Longsnout Dogfish, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan. There are no known deep-water fisheries off the west Pacific Islands.<br/><br/>In southern Africa, the species occurs in areas where deep-water trawl fishing is intensifying with no known management measures in place, but the species is infrequently reported (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>Across the regions, the Longsnout Dogfish&#160;was estimated and inferred to have declined in Australia and Taiwan and remained stable in New Zealand. Due to estimated and inferred declines in part of its range, high levels of exploitation, a global population reduction of 30–49% was inferred over three generation lengths (90 years). Therefore, the Longsnout Dogfish is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Longsnout Dogfish is known from the Southeast Atlantic (southern Africa) and the Indo-Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and west Pacific Islands)&#160;Oceans (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).",The species has historically been utilized for its flesh and liver oil.

It is a euryhaline species that inhabits tropical macrotidal rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters. Previously thought to be very rare, recent surveys in Australia and Papua New Guinea have revealed that the species occurs in higher abundance and in a greater number of rivers and estuaries than previously thought. All life stages from neonates to adults have been recorded in tropical macrotidal rivers and adults have also been recorded in coastal marine waters. It displays a high degree of population structuring, with each of five regions of the species’ range representing a genetically distinct subpopulation. This increases the vulnerability of subpopulations to local threats. The application of close-kin mark-recapture to the core part of the species’ range, rivers of the Van Diemen Gulf (Northern Territory, Australia), has revealed a low adult population size. Accounting for the remainder of the species' distribution, including newly discovered parts of its range in the western Top End (Northern Territory) and the Kimberley region of Western Australia, along with its recently rediscovered range in PNG, the adult population size is estimated to be &gt;2,500 but &lt;10,000 mature individuals. Although a protected species in Australian waters, it is subject to incidental capture in commercial fisheries and some illegal recreational retention. In PNG, it is retained for its meat and fins in largely unregulated fisheries. Based on current and future levels of threat, a continuing decline of at least 10% is projected over the next three generation lengths (54 years) and the Northern River Shark is assessed as Vulnerable C1.<br/><p></p>","The Northern River Shark is a euryhaline species found in freshwater, estuarine, and coastal marine habitats (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009, White <em>et al</em>. 2015, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019). All life stages from neonates, juveniles, subadults to adults have been recorded in tropical macrotidal rivers with high turbidity (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020, P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). Adults have also been recorded in coastal marine waters (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009). Within the riverine environment, the species is however restricted to tidal reaches and does not penetrate upstream into clear water like the sympatric Bull Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). Capture depths in Northern Territory and Western Australian rivers has ranged from 0.7 m to 23 m (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). The exact location of pupping is not known, although it may be in the estuary. Riverine movement patterns are complex, driven daily by the tidal cycle and seasonally by freshwater flow and salinity (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021).<br/><br/>Maximum size is 251 cm total length; male size-at-maturity is 141 cm total length; a female of 177 cm TL was mature although female size-at-maturity is likely smaller than this (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009, Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta, a litter size of 9 pups (based on one gravid female; Pillans et al. 2009), a possible biennial reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 50–65 cm TL (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009). Kyne <em>et al</em>. (2021) used a generation length of 18 years based on age-at-length data for the Speartooth Shark (<em>Glyphis glyphis</em>) and this is followed here. This is further supported by consideration of age data from northern Australia for the euryhaline and sympatric Bull Shark where female age-at-maturity is 9.5 years and maximum age is 26 years, resulting in a generation length of 18 years (Tillet <em>et al</em>. 2011).","This species is caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, commercial, and recreational fisheries and although retention is prohibited in Australia, it is retained in Papua New Guinea for its meat and fins by small-scale fishers. The Northern River Shark occupies large tidal rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters. This habitat specificity increases the susceptibility to the impacts of human activities, particularly fishing and habitat modification (Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Australia, the species is incidentally caught in commercial inshore gillnet, line, and pot fisheries, and is subject to minor levels of Indigenous harvest, and illegal recreational take (Field <em>et al</em>. 2013, DoE 2015b, Kyne and Feutry 2017, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021). The Northern River Shark was assessed as at high-risk in a cumulative risk assessment of all fisheries across northern Australia, mainly due to its susceptibility to capture in gill nets and suspected low productivity (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007). The level of illegal recreational take is unknown; however, it is of concern due to the low population size and restricted distribution of the species including reliance on riverine habitat by juveniles (Kyne and Feutry 2017). The species is known to have a high mortality rate when captured in gillnets (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009) and juveniles are susceptible to capture in pots targeting Mud Crab (Scylla serrata). Post-release mortality rate when discarded from other commercial fisheries is unknown; however, adoption of best handling guidelines may improve survival (Kyne and Pillans 2014, DoE 2015b). Habitat modification such as water extraction and barriers in rivers, such as dams, barrages, weirs, and poorly constructed road crossings, may affect habitat quality and impede movement patterns of the Northern River Shark (DoE 2015b).<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, this species is caught in small-scale riverine and inshore fisheries and may be subject to habitat degradation in the Gulf of Papua and South Fly District associated with mining and logging activities (White et al. 2017b, M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021). It is incidentally captured in a relatively recently developed high-value fishery for swim bladder (also known as fish maw) that targets mainly Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and Scaly Croaker (<em>Nibea squamosa</em>) in estuarine and coastal habitats (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021).","The Northern River Shark shows a high degree of population structuring. Molecular analysis revealed genetically distinct subpopulations in each of the five known regions of its range: southern Papua New Guinea, Van Diemen Gulf (Northern Territory; NT), Daly River (NT), Cambridge Gulf (Western Australia; WA), and King Sound (WA) (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020). The King Sound subpopulation is particularly distinct and isolated (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020). The rates of movement between these subpopulations was estimated to be very low, indicating that replenishment of any depleted subpopulations by immigration is unlikely (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Historically, the Northern River Shark has been considered a very rare species with only a limited number of records from a restricted number of locations (Pogonoski and Pollard 2003). Pillans <em>et al</em>. (2009) catalogued only 32 records. Since then, dedicated surveys in the NT and WA extending across 12 rivers and estuaries have recorded &gt;600 individuals (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). Neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults have all been recorded in these rivers and estuaries and immature animals are particularly common in the rivers flowing into Van Diemen Gulf (NT) with &gt;500 individuals documented during surveys (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). Unlike the congener Speartooth Shark (<em>Glyphis glyphis</em>), adults have regularly been caught in Van Diemen Gulf rivers (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021).<br/><br/>The application of close-kin mark-recapture estimated an adult population size in Van Diemen Gulf in 2015 of 520–1,116, although when considering all models and 90% confidence intervals this estimate was 320–2,050 individuals (Bravington <em>et al</em>. 2019). The estimates have low precision due to limited age information and a limited range of sampled cohorts (Bravington <em>et al</em>. 2019). The number of mature individuals in the Daly River, Cambridge Gulf, and King Sound is suspected to be smaller than that of Van Diemen Gulf due to the lower catch rates of Northern River Shark in these other systems as well as the smaller geographic area (i.e. a smaller area of available habitat) (Bravington <em>et al</em>. 2019, P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). Kyne <em>et al</em>. (2021) used the Van Diemen Gulf population size estimate to derive an Australian population size estimate of &gt;2,500 but &lt;10,000. This took into account the relative proportion of the species' known range that is represented by Van Diemen Gulf and then accounted for the subpopulations where population size estimates are not available and placed the total in the context of the Criteria C thresholds (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea (PNG), surveys of artisanal fishers on the South Fly District, southern PNG in 2014 recorded two individual Northern River Sharks (White et al. 2015, White et al. 2017a). Subsequent surveys of small-scale fishers in riverine and inshore habitats in the Gulf of Papua and South Fly Coast, southern PNG over three years from 2017 to 2020 recorded a total of 140 Northern River Sharks, which were all juveniles (White et al. 2017a, M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021). These juvenile Northern River Sharks were noted to be commonly caught by fishers in the Fly and Kikori River Deltas relative to other elasmobranchs (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021) with the Northern River Shark being more abundant than the Speartooth Shark. This pattern, where the Northern River Shark is the more common species, is mirrored in Australia (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). &#160;<br/><br/>Based on the estimated small adult population size in Australia (despite relatively common juveniles), it is suspected that the adult population size in PNG is also quite small. The global population size is estimated to be &gt;2,500 but &lt;10,000 mature individuals when accounting for the species' PNG range in addition to the Australian range. Threats are ongoing, particularly incidental and illegal capture in Australian fisheries (see Kyne and Feutry 2017, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021) and largely unregulated fishing pressure in PNG. Habitat degradation in PNG and habitat modification in Australia may also be a threat to this species. Based on current and future levels of threat, a continuing decline of at least 10% is projected over the next three generation lengths (54 years) and the Northern River Shark is assessed as Vulnerable C1.",Decreasing,"The Northern River Shark has a patchy distribution across northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (PNG) in macrotidal rivers, estuaries, and coastal marine waters (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009, White <em>et al</em>. 2015, Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Australia, it was previously known from a marine record off the Wessel Islands (Northern Territory; NT), rivers flowing into Van Diemen Gulf (NT), Cambridge Gulf (Western Australia; WA), and King Sound (WA) (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009). Recent surveys have however revealed a wider range including additional rivers of Van Diemen Gulf, the Daly River (NT), and additional rivers of the Kimberley region of WA (Feutry <em>et al</em>. 2020, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021, A.V. Harry pers. comm. 4 May 2021). Species distribution models suggest that the species occurs more-widely than presently known based on habitat suitability (Udyawer <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Papua New Guinea, the species is known from jaws collected off the Gulf of Papua off Port Romilly in 1966 and Baimuru in 1975, and more recently from additional individuals recorded across the western Gulf of Papua (White <em>et al</em>. 2015, White <em>et al</em>. 2017a, M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021).","Retention of this species is prohibited in Australia, although there is some illegal recreational take with Glyphis spp. being used as bait (Kyne and Feutry 2017) as well as some legal Indigenous harvest. In Papua New Guinea, the meat is used for local consumption and the fins are sold to local buyers through both legal and illegal markets for export (White <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Busilacchi <em>et al</em>. 2021). <em>Glyphis </em>spp. fins have been reported in the international trade, occurring in Hong Kong and China (Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020a, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020b).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In Australia, the species is listed as Critically Endangered on the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). However, this listing was undertaken when the species was known from few records and was considered be to extremely rare. A recent reassessment demonstrates that the species does not meet the criteria for listing as Critically Endangered and recommends a down-listing to Vulnerable (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021). Listing on the EPBC Act means the species is a 'Matter of National Environmental Significance' and is protected under the Act. The species is subject to a national multi-species Recovery Plan which aims to improve the population status and ensure anthropogenic activities do not hinder recovery (DoE 2015a).<br/><br/>In the Northern Territory, the Northern River Shark is listed as an Endangered species under the Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000, and a no-take species under the Fisheries Act 1998 and Fisheries Regulations. In Western Australia, it is protected from commercial and recreational catch under the Fisheries Resource Management Act 1994 and the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. Most Northern Territory rivers are closed to commercial net fishing and a core part of the species' distribution, the Alligator rivers, is within Kakadu National Park and World Heritage Area, providing a significant conservation benefit to the subpopulation there. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), there is currently no species-specific regulation for the Northern River Shark (White <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Species distribution models have suggested the species occurs in other unsurveyed locations (Udyawer <em>et al</em>. 2021). These areas are priorities for surveys; these surveys should utilize appropriate methods and target the species' preferred salinity and turbidity ranges (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kyne and Pillans 2014).

Molecular analysis from northern Australia show two genetically distinct units which might be considered to be subpopulations: Wenlock River, Queensland, and Van Diemen Gulf, Northern Territory (NT) (Feutry&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Feutry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). At the time of these analyses, the work covered the species' entire known extant Australian range, i.e. Wenlock River of Queensland, and the Adelaide River and Alligator rivers of Van Diemen Gulf. The species displays strong female philopatry to each of these rivers with males likely moving between rivers less than 150 km apart in the Van Diemen Gulf (Feutry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Feutry&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). There is not yet information available on the genetic relationship of the Papua New Guinea (PNG) population, but further analyses are underway to assess genetic structuring of newly-discovered populations in the western Top End of the NT and the Kimberley region of Western Australia (WA) along with the Kikori River, PNG (P.M. Kyne, M.I. Grant&#160;<em>et al.</em>, unpubl. data 2021).<br/><br/>The Speartooth Shark has historically been considered a very rare species with only a limited number of records from a restricted number of locations (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 2009). Pillans <em>et al.</em> (2009) cataloged 106 records from Australia, most of which  (n=84) were from the Adelaide River, NT. Since then, dedicated surveys in the NT and WA extending across eight rivers, but primarily focused on the Adelaide and South Alligator Rivers, have recorded &gt;400&#160;individuals (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021). All have, however, been neonate, juvenile, or subadult with adults never recorded in the NT or WA (and only very limited numbers recorded from Queensland and PNG). In Queensland, Pillans <em>et al.</em> (2009) documented 11 records from the Wenlock River-Ducie River-Port Musgrave system and two records from the Bizant River. There are no further records from the Bizant River and given that the historical records were collected prior to 1983, it has been speculated that the species may be extinct there (Pillans <em>et al. </em>2009). We caution that such a conclusion cannot be reached without dedicated surveys targeting the preferred salinity and turbidity ranges of the species with appropriate sampling methods (Kyne and Pillans 2014). The Wenlock River has been the focus of research into the species' ecology (e.g., Lyon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Dwyer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019, Dwyer <em>et al.</em> 2020), and similar to the Van Diemen Gulf rivers, juveniles are relatively common there (e.g., Feutry <em>et al. </em>2017 included 125 samples from the Wenlock River).&#160;<br/><br/>In PNG, surveys of artisanal fishers on the South Fly District, southern PNG in 2014 recorded three adult Speartooth Sharks from coastal waters (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Subsequent surveys of small-scale fishers in riverine and inshore habitats in the Gulf of Papua and South Fly District, southern PNG over three years from 2017 to 2020 recorded a total of 38 Speartooth Sharks, which were all juveniles (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021). In the same survey, 140 Northern River Shark (<em>G. garricki)</em> were recorded and together, these&#160;<em>Glyphis</em>&#160;spp. were noted to be commonly caught by the fishers relative to other elasmobranchs (M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2021), although the survey suggests that Speartooth Shark are less abundant than the Northern River Shark. This pattern, where the Speartooth Shark is the less common species, is mirrored in Australia (P.M. Kyne unpubl. data 2021).&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>Close-kin mark-recapture has been applied to the Wenlock River and Van Diemen Gulf subpopulation to produce adult population sizes (see Bravington <em>et al.</em> 2019 for methodology). Although these estimates are not yet published, they were used by Kyne <em>et al.</em> (2021) to derive an Australian population size estimate of &gt;2,500 but &lt;10,000. This took into account the estimates from the Wenlock River and Van Diemen Gulf and the relative proportion of the species' known range that these subpopulations represented. The total population size accounted for the subpopulations where population size estimates are not available and placed the total in the context of the Criteria C thresholds (see Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021 for further details).<br/><br/>Based on the estimated small adult population in Australia (despite relatively common juveniles), it is suspected that the adult population size in PNG is also quite small. The global population size is estimated to be &gt;2,500 but &lt;10,000 mature individuals when accounting for the species' PNG range in addition to the Australian range. Threats are ongoing, particularly incidental and illegal capture in Australian fisheries (see Kyne and Feutry 2017, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021) and largely unregulated fishing pressure in PNG. Habitat degradation in PNG and habitat modification in Australia may also be a threat to this species.<em></em>&#160;Based on current and future levels of threat, a continuing decline of at least 10% is projected over the next three generation lengths (54 years) and the Speartooth Shark is assessed as Vulnerable C1.",Decreasing,"The Speartooth Shark has a patchy distribution across northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea in macrotidal rivers, estuaries, and coastal marine waters (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009, White <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Australia, previously it had been documented from the Bizant River, eastern Cape York, Queensland (but has not been reported there since 1982 although further dedicated surveys are needed), the Wenlock River-Ducie River-Port Musgrave system on western Cape York, and various rivers flowing into Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory (NT) (Pillans <em>et al</em>. 2009). Recent surveys have however revealed a wider range including rivers of the western Top End (NT) and the Kimberley region of Western Australia (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021, A.V. Harry pers. comm. 4 May 2021). Species distribution models suggest that the species occurs more-widely than presently known based on habitat suitability (Udyawer <em>et al</em>. 2021). In Papua New Guinea, it was first known from jaws collected close to Port Romilly in 1966 and from jaws collected from the Fly River (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2008) and has been more recently recorded from the Kikori and Fly Rivers, and Daru region of the South Fly District (White <em>et al</em>. 2015, M.I.

In Papua New Guinea, the meat is used for local consumption and the fins are sold to local buyers through both legal and illegal markets for export (White <em>et al. </em>2017a, Busilacchi <em>et al.</em> 2021). <em>Glyphis </em>spp. fins have been reported in the international trade, occurring in Hong Kong and China (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2020a, Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2020b).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In Australia, the species is listed as Critically Endangered on the Commonwealth <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </em>(EPBC Act)<em>. </em>However, this listing was undertaken when the species was considered be to extremely rare and possibly thought to be extinct in part of its historic Australian range (the Bizant River, Queensland). A recent reassessment demonstrates that the species does not meet the criteria for listing as Critically Endangered and recommends a down-listing to Vulnerable (Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2021). Listing on the EPBC Act means the species is a 'Matter of National Environmental Significance' and is protected under the Act. The species is subject to a national multi-species Recovery Plan which aims to improve the population status and ensure anthropogenic activities do not hinder recovery (DoE 2015a).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Northern Territory, the Speartooth Shark is listed as a Vulnerable species under the&#160;<em>Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000,</em>&#160;and a no-take species under the <em>Fisheries Act 1998&#160;</em>and Fisheries Regulations. In Queensland, it is listed as a no-take species under the Queensland&#160;<em>Fisheries Act 1994&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>Fisheries Regulations 2008. </em>Most Northern Territory rivers are closed to commercial net fishing and a core part of the species' distribution, the Alligator rivers, is within Kakadu National Park and World Heritage Area, providing a significant conservation benefit to the juvenile population there.

Kyne and A.V. Harry, unpubl. data 2021), there is a need for legislative protection in that jurisdiction. There is also a need for targeted surveys in the Bizant River, Queensland, to confirm its presence/absence there since the last records are prior to 1983 (Pillans&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Species distribution models have suggested the species also occurs in other unsurveyed locations (Udyawer <em>et al. </em>2021).

Despite this, the intensive and largely unmanaged net and trawl fisheries that occur throughout most of its range (with the exception of Australia) fish heavily in its known habitat and are likely to catch this species when present. Many shark stocks in the region are known to be over-exploited, with catches declining, and market surveys indicate that this species has declined in areas where it was once considered common. This species has not been reported in surveys of the South China Sea where it has previously been recorded.<br/><br/>This declining trend is likely to continue in future in the absence of management and because of continued, if not increasing, fishing effort. Based on global declines in chondrichthyan landings of at least 20% over the past 12 years, and the fact that the Indo-Pacific region is a region with some of the most poorly managed and intensely fished waters, a population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations (27 years) is inferred for the Fossil Shark, and a decline at a similar rate is expected to occur over the next three generations; hence the species is assessed as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>In Australian waters, this species is suspected to be Least Concern as a result of well-managed fisheries and low catches.","The Fossil Shark&#160;occurs on the continental shelf, inshore to a depth of 130 m (Compagno 1998).&#160;This viviparous species has a seasonal reproductive cycle, producing 2 to 11 (mean = 6) young per litter, ranging in size from 45 to 52 cm total length (TL; Compagno 1984, Last and Stevens 2009). Mating appears to take place around June, ovulation in September and birth in about April, with a gestation period of about 7 to 8 months. The pregnancy rate among mature females off Australia is about 30%, which suggests that individual females may breed every other year (Stevens and McLoughlin 1991).&#160;This species attains 240 cm TL, with females and males maturing at approximately 120 and 110 cm TL, respectively.&#160;Smart <em>et al</em>. (2013) provided age and growth data for specimens caught off the east coast of Queensland. Growth appears to be quite rapid, with maturity reached in 2–3 years. Maximum observed age was 15 years.&#160;Generation length is estimated to be 9 years, based on age data from Smart <em>et al. </em>(2013).","The gillnet and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) are very extensive and as a result, many shark species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Trawl and gillnet fisheries are moving further away, for example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local shark populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). In the Gulf of Thailand, this species was once considered common, however, surveys in recent years have observed very few specimens (L.J.V Compagno, pers. comm. 2003). Similarly, in the waters of the South China Sea (including Hong Kong and parts of mainland China) this species has been recorded in historic surveys, but has been absent from all recent surveys (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2010) indicating that it may have become locally extinct in some parts of Asia. The numbers observed in market surveys in Indonesia are likely to provide a relatively good representation of a likely depleted population although no baseline information exists (White 2007). It is taken in very small quantities in fisheries throughout the Arabian/Persian&#160;Gulf and Red Sea (Moore and Peirce 2013, Spaet and Berumen 2015,&#160;Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015) but its status there is unknown.<br/><br/>The Fossil Shark&#160;is a minor component of the northern Australian gillnet and trawl (prawn and fish) fisheries (Last and Stevens 2009, Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Zhou and Griffiths 2008). In the inshore gillnet fishery on the east coast of Queensland it makes up about 0.1% of the catch. It makes up similar proportions in other coastal fisheries across northern Australia. The catch (which is discarded) in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery is small, and estimates of fishing mortality indicate that the level of take is sufficiently low to ensure sustainability (Zhou and Griffiths 2008).","The Fossil Shark appears to be naturally rare in most places where it occurs. There are no data available on population structure, but the population is inferred to be declining based on heavy exploitation of coastal and shelf fishes across most of its range.",Decreasing,"The Fossil Shark has a wide range in the Indo-West Pacific including South Africa, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Yemen (Aden), the Red Sea, the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Viet Nam, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, southern Papua New Guinea, and northern and western Australia (Last and Stevens 2009, Jaiteh and Momigliano 2015).

68628645,195456,Himantura leoparda,Vulnerable,A2bd,2016,2015-02-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Leopard Whipray (<em>Himantura leoparda</em>) is possibly widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific in mainly coastal inshore waters. It is currently known to range from Southeast Asia to the Japanese Archipelago and south to northern Australia, however there are ongoing taxonomic issues that are being investigated, the outcomes of which may affect the known range.<br/><br/>Its biology is poorly known, partly due to confusion with other members of the ‘<em>uarnak</em>’ species-complex. This species is commercially valuable throughout Southeast Asia where it is taken as utilised bycatch in a range of commercial and artisanal fisheries including demersal trawl and tangle/gill nets, dropline and longline fisheries, and Danish seine fisheries. In recent decades, demersal fishing pressure has increased in both capacity and effort and is intense throughout this species’ inshore range in Southeast Asia. Fishing pressure is also very heavy in the Arafura Sea region; previously more than 600 trawlers operated and although the numbers of currently active trawlers is unclear, there are still high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the area. This level of exploitation is of great concern to the sustainability of Leopard Whipray populations in the Arafura Sea outside the Australian Fishing Zone.<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation and destructive fishing practices throughout a large part of its range. Although species-specific data are not available, given the species’ high levels of exploitation, extensive habitat degradation and its large size, significant population declines are inferred to have occurred and are likely to be ongoing in Southeast Asia. Conversely, this species has refuge from fishing pressure in northern Australia, where fishing pressure is light, bycatch mitigation measures are in place and it is not commercially utilised and consequently is considered at low risk.<br/><br/>Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is caught in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays, the level of decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations) and exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, as well as from habitat loss. The Leopard Whipray is assessed as Vulnerable globally based on inferred levels of decline and exploitation across a large part of its range, but is considered to be Least Concern in Australia.","The Leopard Whipray is demersal on soft substrates and is mainly inshore and coastal though it also occurs on the continental shelf to at least 70 m depth (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2008). The biology of this species is poorly known, partly due to confusion with other species of the ‘<em>uarnak</em>’ species-complex, especially the Reticulate Whipray (<em>H. uarnak</em>) and the Honeycomb Whipray (<em>H. undulata</em>) (Last and Stevens 2009). It attains about 140 cm disc width (DW); born at about 20 cm DW; males mature at 70–94 cm DW (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009). Reproduction is viviparous (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>As there is no information on this species’ maximum age and age at maturity, generation length was inferred as 20 years based on data for the congener, the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Himantura astra</em>). Female Blackspotted Whiprays are reported to have a maximum age of 29 years and an age at maturity of nine years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). These were used to calculate a generation length of 19 years based on the equation: generation length = 9+((29-9)/2). The maximum size of the Leopard Whipray is considerably larger (~140 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted Whipray (80 cm DW) so it is possible the generation length of the Leopard Whipray could be greater than 20 years.","The threats to the Leopard Whipray are many of those faced by other <em>Himantura</em> species within its range. However, the Leopard Whipray may be more vulnerable than some of its congeners due to its large size at maturity and maximum size and its preference for inshore coastal waters that are heavily fished and degraded in many parts of its range outside Australian waters (Manjaji and White 2004).<br/><br/>In Indonesia and across large parts of its distribution, the Leopard Whipray is caught by demersal trawl and tangle/gill nets, dropline and longline fishing, Danish seine fishing gear, and coastal artisanal fisheries (Manjaji and White 2004, White <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Southeast Asia, this species is commercially valuable, with most specimens caught as bycatch landed and sold. The Leopard Whipray is important in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters, which likely also includes adjacent waters. These fisheries, along with trawl fishing are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2004, it was reported that more than 600 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Manjaji and White 2004). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone have recently been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009) and thus the level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high.<br/><br/>In recent decades, demersal fishing pressure has increased in both capacity and effort in many areas of this species’ inshore range. For example, demersal resources in the Gulf of Thailand went from being lightly exploited to severely over-exploited between 1973 and 1994 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2005). On standardized trawl surveys conducted over this 20 year period in the Gulf of Thailand, the abundance (biomass) of the major trawl bycatch groups was recorded. The group ‘rays’ showed a large reduction in biomass over this period and an ecosystem model fitted to the bycatch data indicated that ‘rays’ were one of the groups most severely impacted by the initial increase in fishing pressure (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2005). Species-specific catch data are not available, but Indonesian landings of ‘Rays, stingrays, mantas, nei’ (nei = not elsewhere included) increased from ~10,000 t in 1975 to 58,000 t in 2004 (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007).<br/><br/>Although data are available mostly only for grouped ‘rays’ and not specifically for the Leopard Whipray and/or other <em>Himantura</em> species, given that the Leopard Whipray is a large species with a preference for shallow waters where threats from coastal fisheries and habitat degradation are highest, significant declines are suspected to have occurred in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Conversely, this species has refuge from fishing pressure across its range in northern Australia where there is much less fishing pressure and bycatch mitigation measures are enacted. Large specimens were previously occasionally caught as bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), a trawl fishery across northern Australia, but the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in 2000 significantly reduced the bycatch of this species, particularly those individuals &gt;1 m DW (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the NPF, this species was considered to have a moderate to high sustainability to the impacts of trawling (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002, Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It has also been recorded as a minor component of the bycatch in the banana prawn and scallop sectors of the Queensland East Coast Otter Trawl Fishery (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2001, Courtney <em>et al</em>. 2007), but again the use of TEDs in this fishery should limit bycatch (particularly of larger specimens).","<p>                   </p>Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Leopard Whipray in Southeast Asia are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>It is not possible to estimate the proportion of the global population occurring within the Australian region as there is little information on the population structure of this species, however an estimated 15% of the Leopard Whipray’s known distributional range is in the Australian region.",Decreasing,"<p>The Leopard Whipray is possibly widespread in the Indo-West Pacific. Its range is based on current knowledge, however there are ongoing taxonomic issues that are being investigated and the outcomes of these may affect the known range. It is currently known from Southeast Asia to the Japanese Archipelago and south to northern Australia, where it occurs from Coral Bay, Western Australia to the Torres Strait, Queensland (Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2008, Last and Stevens 2009).

Except in Australian waters, the fisheries that capture this species are largely unregulated (licenses are issued but catches and landings are not properly monitored), and presently there are no specific conservation actions in place to help address this problem.

The global population size is not known, but some local and regional population sizes have been estimated and are mostly small, at less than 1,000 individuals, with the exception of the Maldives where the population is estimated at ~10,000. While individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently, consequently aggregations are widely separated with low connectivity resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion. The species has an extremely slow life history, producing only 1 pup on average every 4–5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) among elasmobranchs. Reef Manta Rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale industrial tuna fisheries. The meat is consumed locally and they are traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. Where Reef Manta Rays are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. Elsewhere, however, very rapid declines in sightings records have occurred&#160;where they are targeted or caught as bycatch. For example, Reef Manta Ray sightings declined by 98% over a 15-year period (half a generation span)&#160;in southern Mozambique. Where fishing pressure is higher, the Reef Manta Ray is suspected to have declined to the point of local extinction in&#160;many places throughout much of the Indian Ocean. Globally, the suspected population reduction is 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (87 years) with further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2105). The suspected past and future population reduction is based on extremely low maximum rates of population increase, current and ongoing levels of exploitation, steep decline estimates, and reduction in extent of occurrence due to suspected local and regional extinctions, offset only by stable trajectories in a relatively few well-protected areas. The Reef Manta Ray is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd+3d.</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Reef Manta Ray is a neritic and oceanic pelagic ray typically resident in productive near-shore environments, such as coral and rocky reefs, island groups, atolls, and continental coastlines (Marshall <em>et al. </em>2009). It often exhibits diel patterns in habitat use moving inshore during the day to clean and socialize in shallow waters, and then moving offshore at night to feed (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2008, Van Duinkerken 2010, Jaine <em>et al.</em> 2014). The Reef Manta Ray is one of the largest ray species attaining a maximum size of 500 cm disc width (DW), however, it rarely exceeds 400 cm DW (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2009, Deakos 2010, Stevens 2016, Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017). Males mature at 270–300 cm DW and females mature at 300–350 cm DW. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a single large pup of 130–150 cm DW in the wild (180–190 cm DW in captivity) born every 1–7 years, with central tendency of a 4–5 year reproductive cycle (Marshall and Bennett 2010a, Deakos 2011, Kashiwagi 2014, Stevens 2016). Female age-at-maturity is 8–17 years, depending on region and food availability, and maximum age is estimated at 45 years; generation length is therefore 29 years (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2014, Stevens 2016). Based on this life history, the maximum intrinsic rate of population  increase could range between 0.019 and 0.046 per year (median 0.032 per  year) (J. Carlson unpubl. data following methods in Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is among the longest-living rays and has an extremely conservative life history; the average Reef Manta Ray may produce only 4–7 pups during its estimated lifespan, which would contribute to its slow recovery from population reductions due to over-exploitation or other threats.</p>","<p>  </p><p>Mobulid rays, including the Reef Manta Ray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Manta rays are also caught in bather protection nets (<strong></strong>Cliff and Dudley 2011, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries 2018). Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine and longline fisheries and targeted capture in artisanal fisheries (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). In particular, Reef Manta Rays are easy to target because of their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate, predictable habitat use, and lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p><p>Mobula rays, including Reef Manta Rays, are caught in at least 13 targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries. Some of the largest documented fisheries have been in Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, México, Taiwan, Mozambique, Palestine (Gaza Strip), and Peru (Courturier<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Croll&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), where sometimes thousands of manta rays are landed per annum (Alava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). While many artisanal fisheries have grown to meet international trade demand for gill plates, some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Essumang 2010, Rohner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;</p><p>Mobula rays, including Reef Manta Rays, are caught incidentally as bycatch throughout their ranges in at least 21 small-scale fisheries in 15 countries and 9 large-scale fisheries in 11 countries (Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically retained because of their high trade value. Even when discarded alive, e.g. from tuna purse seine fisheries, they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017). Many fisheries remain open and active even after dozens of national fishing bans and international listings on the appendices of both Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) (Lawson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018).&#160;<br/></p>  <p>Global landings of mobulid species, including Reef Manta Ray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2015, O’Malley <em>et al.</em> 2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011).&#160;Between 2000 and 2007, total landings of&#160; 'Mantas, devil rays, nei' ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009). While this equates to an average of 1,593 metric tonnes being landed per annum, reported landings are likely to represent only a fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The source locations for the largest amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</p><p>In the Western Indian Ocean, Romanov (2002) estimated that between 253 and 539 manta rays and devilrays were being caught per year as bycatch in purse seine fisheries, and between 2003 and 2007, 35 manta rays were observed in purse seine bycatch, some of which were likely Reef Manta Ray (Amande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). In the Western and Central Pacific, from 2010–2015, observed bycatch of manta rays in purse seine fisheries was 4,176 individuals, and in longline fisheries was 226 individuals (based on distribution, some of these were likely Reef Manta Ray) (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). While a few individuals were released in good condition, post-release mortality is likely to be high as most were released alive but injured, or dead (Francis and Jones 2017). The Eastern Pacific purse seine fisheries show a substantial increase in the bycatch of mobulid rays, including Reef Manta Rays, from 20 tonnes per year before 2005 to 150 tonnes per year by 2006, which then reduced to 10 tonnes per year by 2009 (Hall and Roman 2013). The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) purse seine vessels <span lang=""en-GB"">operating during 2015 in the Pacific reported landings  of 71 tonne of mobulid species, that likely included Reef Manta Ray (Miller and  Klimovich 2017).&#160;</p><p>While the overwhelming cause of population reduction is fishing mortality, sublethal effects and lower levels of mortality occur from numerous lesser threats, such as entanglement in nets, recreational foul hooking, and vessel strikes (Marshall and Bennett 2010b, Deakos <em>et al. </em>2011, Couturier<em> et al.</em> 2012, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). While there is no direct evidence, there are concerns for the effects of climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other forms of pollution&#160;and contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Stewart&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Furthermore, shallow water lagoon nursery habitats are subject to habitat loss and degradation that pose threats to juvenile Reef Manta Rays (Stewart<em> et al.</em> 2018).</p>","<p>  </p><p>The global population size of the Reef Manta Ray is difficult to assess, but abundance trajectories have been estimated based on long time-series of sightings at diving sites. Generally, divers encounter the Reef Manta Ray with far greater frequency than the Giant Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>), which is likely due to the occurrence of Reef Manta Ray&#160;in shallow coastal waters of many well-developed tourist areas. Additionally, Reef Manta Ray encounters are more reliable because they aggregate and habitually visit specific cleaning stations (Marshall 2009, Stevens 2016).</p>  <p>In most regions, Reef Manta Ray population sizes appear to be small (less than 1,000 individuals). Photo-identification studies and mark-recapture studies at specific aggregation sites in Hawaii (Deakos <em>et al.</em> 2011), Yap (B. Acker pers. comm. 10/2/2009), Mozambique (Marshall <em>et al.</em> 2011), Japan (Kashiwagi <em></em>2014), the east coast of Australia (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2014), and Indonesia (E. Germanov pers. comm. 9/11/2018,&#160;&#160;R. Perryman pers. comm. 8/11/2018, S. Venables pers. comm. 6/11/2018), have produced minimum estimates of 85 to 1,000 individuals. In one location, the Maldives, larger country-wide studies have produced catalogues of more than 4,000 individuals (Kitchen-Wheeler 2010, Stevens 2016). Petersen&#160;and Jolly-Seber probabilistic estimators were used to&#160;assess population size for the main aggregation areas in the archipelago with a final extrapolation of 9,677 individuals for the entire Maldives (Kitchen-Wheeler 2010).</p><p>There is low connectivity between widely separated sites and a high degree of residency, rendering Reef Manta Ray vulnerable to local depletion and regional extinction. While individuals are capable of long-distance movements, such as up to 650 km, they appear to do so very infrequently (Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Germanov and Marshall 2014, A. Marshall unpubl. data).&#160;Cross-referencing of regional photo-identification databases reveals little evidence of long-distance interchange occurring indicating a low degree of connectivity between Reef Manta Ray aggregation sites (Deakos <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stevens and Peschak 2016, Holmberg and Marshall 2018). Long-term studies, including those which have incorporated telemetry, suggest resident populations are common. Movement patterns suggest small home ranges and seasonal migrations (Dewar <em>et al. </em>2008, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jaine <em>et al</em>. 2012, Jaine <em>et al</em>. 2014, Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2018, Setyawan <em>et al.</em> 2018). There appears to be a tendency for rays to visit specific sites of restricted geographical extent (Dewar <em>et al. 2</em>008, Perle 2011, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2014, Jaine <em>et al.</em> 2014, Stevens 2016, Kessel<em> et al.</em> 2017, Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2018, Setyawan <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>The trajectory of the number of individuals varies widely across the range of Reef Manta Ray, but trajectories are stable where they are protected and declining rapidly where fishing pressure is greater. The number of individuals appears stable in locations where they receive some level of protection, such as Australia (A. Armstrong pers. comm. 31/10/2018), Japan (Kashiwagi 2013), the Maldives (G. Stevens pers. comm. 10/11/2018), and inside marine protected areas in Indonesia (A. Marshall unpubl. data). Elsewhere, the number of individuals is likely to be declining in places where the species is targeted or caught regularly as bycatch. There are two estimates based on sightings-per-unit-effort. In southern Mozambique, a 98% decline in diver sighting records occurred over a 15-year period in a well-studied population (Rohner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Maui, Hawaii, there has been a 94% decline in sighting records in some places where a long-term study has noted a high proportion of fishing entanglement injuries (Deakos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, M. Deakos pers. comm. 10/11/2018). Elsewhere in Hawaii, the number of sightings has been stable (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p>    <p>Along with these sightings data, it is suspected (based on historical sightings, distribution data, and habitat suitability) that the Reef Manta Ray may have been depleted in areas where significant fisheries for manta rays exist, such as Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, and Indonesia. In these densely populated and heavily fished countries, fishing pressure may have more swiftly depleted resident aggregations of Reef Manta Rays.&#160;</p><p>There are two narratives consistent with rapid local depletion and disappearance of manta rays, particularly in Indonesia. In the Alor region of eastern Indonesia, increasing international trade demand for manta ray products in the 1990s resulted in increased fishing effort with up to 2,400 manta and devilrays landed per year. Consequently, manta ray catches (including what was suspected to be the Reef Manta Ray) declined sharply in this region, forcing fishers to travel further afield to find manta rays (Dewar 2002). The Reef Manta Ray is no longer seen in this region. In East Flores and Lembata, Indonesia, manta rays (including the Reef Manta Ray) had historically been fished by indigenous villagers&#160;since 1959, with up to 360 individuals caught a year (Barnes 2005). By 1996, no mantas were being landed.&#160;</p><p>Recently, target fisheries for the Reef Manta Ray have begun in some locations, like Dinagat Island in northern Mindanao, Philippines (Acebes and Tull 2016). Formerly, manta ray catches comprised of the Giant Manta Ray and more recently fishers claim that they now target the smaller more-resident Reef Manta Ray to supply products to Bohol during the off season. This example highlights the potential for an expansion and subsequent depletion of Giant Manta Ray fisheries to pivot toward Reef Manta Rays in the future (Acebes and Tull 2016).&#160;</p><p>In Papua New Guinea, local declines have been noted and are attributed to fishing pressure (Rose 2008). Unspecified manta rays (some of which, based on distribution records, were likely Reef Manta Rays) were caught as non-target species in purse seine sets from 1995 until 2006. There was a distinct and significant rise in the number of manta rays caught in these fisheries in 2001, which steadily rose until 2005/2006 when sharp declines were noted in the catch (Rose 2008).&#160; </p>Although sparse, the available data suggest that localized populations of the Reef Manta Ray have been rapidly depleted by target fisheries in some regions and that local extinction is suspected to have occurred in many parts of their historical range. Globally, the suspected population reduction is 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (87 years), with a further population reduction projected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2105) based on current and ongoing threats and exploitation levels, steep declines in monitored populations, a reduction in extent of occurrence, and suspected local and regional extinctions. In the few places where manta rays are protected, the number of individuals is stable.",Decreasing,"The Reef Manta Ray is widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout much of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, from the surface down to depths of 432 m (Lawson<em> et al.</em> 2017).","<p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012). The gill plates fetch high prices in Asia and are used for Chinese health tonics (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017).

Even with legislative protection in some areas, fisheries for manta ray persist in others and there are more locations still where they are incidentally captured as bycatch in artisanal as well as small- and large-scale fisheries.&#160;With little to no effort to monitor or regulate mobulid fisheries in many countries, these current paper regulations are proving inadequate and misleading.</p><p>Manta rays have been listed in the appendices of a number of international conventions. The Reef Manta Ray was listed on Appendix I and II of the Bonn Convention for CMS in 2014, however, many CMS Parties have inadequate protections (Lawson and Fordham 2018). As a threatened species whose wide-ranging migratory tendencies put it at risk, this listing acknowledges the fact that this species would benefit from the implementation of cooperative international agreements to manage and protect its populations and encourages range states to work together toward this goal. <em>Manta </em>species (i.e. including Reef Manta Ray) were listed on Appendix II of CITES in 2013, requiring CITES Parties to&#160;legitimize all exports through a permitting system based on non-detriment findings which delimit acceptable, sustainable catches.&#160;</p>  <p>Only a single Regional Fishing Management Organization (RFMO) has formally prohibited the retention of manta rays as bycatch, with most regulatory systems doing an inadequate job of protecting mobulid rays from fishing mortality. In 2015, recognizing the threatened status of mobulid rays, including the Reef Manta Ray, IATTC adopted recommendations which prohibited retaining, trans-shipping, landing, storing or selling, in whole or in part, any species of <em>Mobula </em>and required going forward that all mobulid rays be promptly released alive under strict non-detrimental protocols (Lawson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018).

It occurs on continental and insular slopes at depths of 180-1,550 m, but is most common at depths &gt;600 m. It is generally considered to be low in abundance, and declines have been documented in part of its range. Plunket's Shark is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline fisheries, and there is high distribution overlap with fishing effort in New Zealand and Australia (with information on interactions with fisheries lacking from elsewhere). Strong associations to seamounts and propensity to aggregate may also increase its susceptibility to capture. At this time, there are no species-specific management actions in place for Plunket's Shark, however, fisheries closures and restrictions in the Tasman Sea are likely to indirectly offer this species some refuge. This is a low productivity species, and it is inferred that the population has declined by at least 30% over the past three generations (~100 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and documented declines. Thus, Plunket's Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.<br/></p>","<p>Plunket's Shark is recorded on continental and insular slopes at depths of 180-1,550 m, but is most common at depths &gt;600 m (Roberts <em>et al</em>. 2015). It reaches a maximum size of 170 cm total length (TL) and may live at least 39 years; males mature at ~110 cm TL and 18 years of age; females mature at 130-140 cm TL and 29 years of age; size at birth 32-36 cm TL (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Irvine 2004). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous and presumed to be asynchronous; litter size of up to 36 pups (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Based on the above age data, generation length is estimated at 34 years.<br/></p>","Plunket's Shark is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline fisheries across its range (Walker and Gason 2007, Ebert 2015, Francis 2015). In New Zealand, there is high distribution overlap (&gt;60%) with fishing areas (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). On Chatham Rise (New Zealand), of the large deepwater sharks, this species had the narrowest depth range, with most catches between 500-800 m, and was considered most at risk from fishing (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Plunket's Shark is strongly associated with seamounts (Tracey <em>et al</em>. 2004), potentially increasing its susceptibility to capture. It is likely that this species is misidentified with other deepwater sharks (Griggs and Baird 2013), which may underestimate catches.<br/><br/>In Australia, Plunket's Shark is infrequently encountered, but when observed, is recorded in very large catches, suggesting this species forms large aggregations (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species, and other smallspine sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) were previously targeted in mid-slope (650-1,200 m) deepwater shark fisheries (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches are from depths &gt;600 m and were retained (70%) (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species moderate-high risk from commercial fishing (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with high risk from commercial fishing (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008).","There is limited species-specific data on this species, but an overall population decline is inferred by declines of deepwater sharks off southeast Australia, and documented declines to low levels in one area where data are available for New Zealand.<br/><br/>In New Zealand, the species is considered to be low in abundance, given its relatively low average catch rate, and it is unknown if this is a reflection of their natural population size or a consequence of overfishing (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2013). On the northeast Chatham Rise (New Zealand), Plunket's Shark biomass estimates from Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) commercial fisheries declined to 6% between 1984 and 1994 (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2000). This area is only a small portion of the species' Chatham Rise and New Zealand distribution, but it is not known if this decline is representative of the wider distribution of the species. Indeed, research trawl abundance indices show no clear trends across the wider Chatham Rise (1992-2010; O’Driscoll <em>et al</em>. 2011), or Sub-Antarctic (Bagley <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Australia, Plunket's Shark is considered to be rare in abundance (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008). Over a 20 year period (1976/77-1996/97), substantial declines (&gt;90%) of relative abundance of deepwater chondrichthyans on the southeast trawl grounds have been documented (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). Species-specific data are not available for Plunket's Shark, but it is inferred to have declined at least in the upper parts of its depth range.<br/><br/>With Australia and New Zealand representing the core known parts of the species' range, an overall population decline of &gt;30% is inferred over the last 100 years (generation length is 34 years) from actual levels of exploitation. The species probably now has refuge in deeper waters in areas closed to deepwater fishing, suggesting that overall declines of this nature may not be ongoing into the future.",Decreasing,"<p>Plunket's Shark is known from a patchy yet widespread distribution in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, where it has been recorded from the Melville Ridge south of Madagascar, Australia (Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales), and New Zealand (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).</p>",<p>This species is not known to be utilized and catches are mostly discarded.</p>,Marine,"<p>Further information is required on the distribution and population trends of Plunket's Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range.

Plunket's Shark is a non-QMS species, meaning that there is no species-specific management in place (MPI 2013). New Zealand has a system of Benthic Protected Areas (BPAs) and Seamount Closures, however they are unlikely to provide any major refuge for this species given the spatial occurrence of the closed areas (see Black and Tilney 2015).<br/> <br/> In Australia, a combination of trawling closures in most of the&#160;Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery&#160;(SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as&#160;the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.

It inhabits continental shelves from inshore to a depth of 200 m and is a highly productive species that breeds annually and matures early. The species is taken as target and bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with multiple gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline and is retained for the meat and fins; it is one of the most commonly consumed tropical and sub-tropical coastal sharks globally. The population is reported to have increased in northwest Australia over three generation lengths (15 years), and to be both stable over two years and have declined by 99% over the past three generation lengths (15–22 years) in two areas of India, respectively. It is inferred to have declined by 67–80% in Sri Lanka over the past three generation lengths and inferred to have declined in Southeast Asia. In some other parts of its range, the Milk Shark is reported to have undergone a population increase, possibly due to meso-predator release. The species' productivity likely provides some resilience to fishing pressure, however, the lower productivity where it is heavily exploited in West Africa is of concern. It is heavily fished throughout its range (except in Australia) in mostly unregulated fisheries, and steep declines over the past three generation lengths have been reported. It is suspected that the Milk Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15–22 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.</p>","The Milk Shark occurs on the continental shelf in tropical and sub-tropical waters from close inshore to depths of 200 m (Weigmann 2016). It is found throughout the water column but is mainly near the sea floor and is often occurs off sandy beaches and sometimes in estuaries (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). The species is usually &lt;110 cm total length (TL), although one specimen of 178 cm TL was recorded off Africa (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). Life history traits vary regionally with males mature at 54–82 cm TL and females mature at 62–92 cm (Harry <em>et al. </em>2010, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ba <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–8, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 25–45 cm TL (Harry <em>et al. </em>2010, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Shaaban <em>et al.</em> 2018). In northeast Australia, female age-at-maturity is two years and maximum age is eight years, resulting in a generation length of five years (Harry <em>et al. </em>2010). In Senegal, female age-at-maturity is 5.8 years and maximum age is nine years, resulting in a generation length of 7.4 years (Ba <em>et al.</em> 2015).","<p>The Milk Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, trawl, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Last and Stevens 2009, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). Commercial at-vessel-mortality (AVM) has only been reported for this species in trawl fisheries where it is highly variable ranging from 29–82% in the Indian Ocean and North Australia, respectively (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Atlantic, this species is heavily fished throughout its range and frequently caught in Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal,  Gambia, Guinea Bissau, and Guinea (Diop and Dossa 2011). It is the most commonly caught shark landed at fishing sites along the Senegalese coast (Capape <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ba <em>et al.</em> 2015). The predominance of juvenile Milk Shark in landings during all seasons could be an indication that the species is overexploited in Senegalese waters (Ba <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is among the most commonly caught shark by artisanal fisheries in the waters of Mauritania (Valadou <em>et al. </em>2006). In the Banc d’Arguin National Park (Mauritania) 70–85% of individuals caught from April to June are females, more than half of which are pregnant with fully-developed embryos (Diop and Dossa 2011); this suggests that fishers target a pupping aggregation in this region. Declines in coastal shark assemblages have been reported throughout the   eastern Atlantic region, although recreational fishers in the Bijagos   Archipelago (Guinea-Bissau) have noticed an increased abundance of Milk   Shark that has been attributed to declines in the numbers of large,   predatory sharks (Diop and Dossa 2011). <strong></strong> <br/></p><p>In South African waters, the Milk Shark is caught incidentally by prawn trawl fisheries. The estimated annual catch of the Milk Shark in trawl fisheries of South Africa was &lt;1 tonne for 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also important to recreational fisheries and was the second most commonly caught shark (18% of total catch) in the Kwa-Zulu Natal competitive shore fishery from 1977 to 2000 (Pradervand 2007). Van der Elst (1979) hypothesized that an increase in abundance of small sharks, including the Milk Shark, in the Kwa-Zulu Natal recreational fishery was due to the removal of large, predatory sharks by the Natal Sharks Board protective gillnet program.&#160;Extensive artisanal fisheries operate in coastal waters of the southwestern Indian Ocean (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Benkenstein 2013, Cripps <em>et al.</em>  2015). It is an important component of commercial and artisanal shark  fisheries in mainland Tanzania and&#160;Zanzibar where it has been recorded  as the most abundant in market surveys (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002,  Schaeffer 2004). The species is also an important component of artisanal  shark fisheries in Madagascar waters (Robinson and Sauer 2013). </p><p>  </p><p>In the Arabian Seas region, surveys of fish markets and landings sites have revealed this species&#160;to be a major part of elasmobranch landings, often as bycatch in gillnet fisheries (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015, Spaet and Berumen 2015). The high level of exploitation on its habitat in the region is of concern.&#160;For example,&#160;in Eritrea&#160;catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). <a name=""_Hlk31633737"">While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is widespread and impacting shark populations (Glaser <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen almost doubling from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).&#160; In some areas (e.g. Pakistan, </a><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">India</a><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">) fishing effort on this species has been increasing in recent years. </a><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate  in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer  shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).</a><a name=""_Hlk31633737""> CMFRI (2010) reports that 5,767 trawlers operate in Tamil Nadu waters, and fishing pressure is intense with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009,&#160;Karnad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Trawling is also intense in Kerala where CMFRI (2010) reported 3,678 trawlers. There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010).&#160; In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010).</a></p><p><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">  </a></p><p><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">In Southeast Asia, the Milk Shark is one of the most commonly caught sharks in trawl fisheries of peninsular Malaysia and is commonly caught in gillnet fisheries of Indonesia (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2006). The extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are also a threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</a></p><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">  </a><p></p>  <p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p>In Australia, the Milk Shark is a bycatch in gillnet and prawn trawl fisheries with low to moderate fishing pressure in managed fisheries. It is usually not retained but post-release mortality is likely high (Stobutzki <em>et al. </em>2002, Tobin<em> et al.</em> 2010). Northwest Australia was closed to commercial fishing of sharks and rays from 1993 to 2005 onwards to protect breeding stocks of Dusky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus obscuru</em>s) and Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>) (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2019). Ecological risk assessments of the Milk Shark have  considered it to be at  low to moderate risk from fishing in Australia  (Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2002, Zhou and Griffiths 2008, Tobin <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","Genetic data suggest that the Milk Shark is a complex of four species that require further taxonomic investigation (Naylor<em> et al. </em>2012). Species-specific population trend data of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was available from northwest Australia (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2019). The fishery-independent survey with droplines and longlines from 2002 to 2017 found the CPUE to be fluctuating but stable.  The area of the surveys was closed to commercial fishing from 1993 to 2005 onwards and the stable pattern is suggested to reflect either no major detrimental fishing effects on the population even prior to the closures or naturally low abundance that precludes detecting abundance patterns (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2019). The CPUE was analysed over three generation lengths (15 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yielded a 3.8% annual rate of increase, consistent with an estimated median increase of 69.3% over three generation lengths (15 years), and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). <br/> <br/> A stock assessment of this species based on landings during 2012–2014 in Gujarat, India showed that the fisheries exploitation level between 2012–2014 reduced stock biomass and spawning stock biomass to 55% and 34% of unexploited levels, respectively (Sen <em>et al. </em>2017). The catch-per-unit-effort from 2012 to 2014 was stable and the assessment considered the population to be underexploited (Sen <em>et al. </em>2017). This assessment should be regarded with caution due to limited time-frame of sampling and some simplistic assumptions. Market surveys from the same region indicate that all life stages of Milk Shark are vulnerable to capture by fisheries (Barnes <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Elsewhere in India, data from Mumbai indicate&#160;declines in landings of this species from 92.9 t in 2000 to 18.5 t in 2005 (Raje <em>et al.</em> 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In India, there is evidence of increasing fishing effort and decreasing  catch-per-unit-effort of sharks in general (K. V. Akhilesh pers.  comm. 09/02/2017). When this decline is scaled to three generation lengths (15–22 years) it represents a decline of 99%. In Sri Lanka, shark catches have decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). This represents a decline of 67–80% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Milk Shark (15–22 years). In Kuwait, this species represented 12.2% of elasmobranch landings by number in 2008 but this declined to 2.6% in 2011 (Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). <strong> </strong>In the Iranian waters of the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, the  Milk Shark has declined in abundance by more than 85% over the past  10–20 years; some of this decline may be due to an increase in illegal  fishing despite a ban on target shark fisheries in Iran introduced ~15  years ago (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 03/06/2020).<strong></strong> In Pakistan, landings of the Milk Shark have declined by 75–80% over the past 20 years due to overfishing (M. Khan pers. comm. 03/06/2020).<br/><strong><br/></strong><a name=""_Hlk31633737"">In Southeast Asia, catches of sharks and rays are  very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from  port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries  in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive  and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and  stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude  (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also  moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at  Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in  local populations (W.T. White pers comm. 22/05/2007). While  species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the  Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Milk Shark in  Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given  the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries  in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006).</a><a name=""_Hlk31633737""><br/></a><br/>Across its range, the population was reported to be increasing in northwest Australia over three generation lengths (15 years), stable over two years in Gujarat, India and to have declined by 99% across three generation lengths (15–22 years) in Mumbai, India. It is inferred to have declined by 67–80% in Sri Lanka and inferred to have declined in Southeast Asia. In some other parts of its range, increases in abundance of the Milk Shark have been reported, possibly due to meso-predator release. The Milk Shark is a productive species which likely increases its resilience to fishing pressure, although the lower productivity in West Africa is of concern as it is heavily exploited in that region. With the exception of Australia, the Milk Shark is exposed to increasing and intense fishing pressure across its range, with steep declines reported in some areas. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population  reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (15–22 years).",Decreasing,"<p>The Milk Shark occurs across the Indo-Pacific from South Africa to Australia, and in the Eastern Atlantic from Madeira and Mauritania to Angola; there are two records of this species in the Mediterranean Sea (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Amor <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/></p>","<p>The Milk Shark is one of the&#160;most consumed sharks in tropical and subtropical coastal waters globally. The flesh is consumed fresh or dried, salted, and smoked and used as fishmeal (Last and Stevens 2009, Roy 2010). Fins are of limited value due to their small size although trade in small, low-value fins has increased in Southeast Asia in recent years (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2019). Milk Shark fins comprised 1.4% of the fins sampled in Hong Kong in 2015 yet were the most common of the small-sized shark fins sampled in Hong Kong in 2019 (Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018, Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>",Marine,"There are few  species-specific regulations for the Milk Shark. In South Africa, for small-scale fishing there is a bag limit of one individual Milk Shark for consumption only (DAFF 2016).&#160; In Iran, a ban on target shark fisheries introduced ~15 years ago (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 03/06/2020) may benefit the Milk Shark. The introduction of bycatch reduction devices in Australian trawl fisheries is likely to have benefited this species (Griffiths <em>et al.</em> 2006), as would have Australia's extensive network of Marine Protected Areas. Research is needed on the species' taxonomy and population size and trends, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It is one of a few hard substrate habitat-dwelling skates occurring on reefs but is also found on soft demersal habitat. The species reaches a maximum size of ~200 cm total length (TL); males mature at 127 cm TL and the smallest mature female found was 160 cm TL (Treloar 2008, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous with egg cases ~22 cm long and size-at-birth of ~20 cm TL (Treloar 2008, Last<em> et al.</em> 2016). Age-at-maturity was 8 years for males and 14 years for the youngest female observed and maximum age was 12 and 16 years, respectively (Treloar 2008). This gives an estimated generation length of 15 years.","The Melbourne Skate is a significant by-product and bycatch in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Annual catch was estimated at 176 t from 2000 to 2006 with 30% of the catch retained; it represents the largest batoid catch of the SESSF.&#160;There is a strong basis for inferring that sustained trawling over 20 years is the predominant and most likely cause of the observed changes in relative abundance of rays on the New South Wales upper continental slope (see <em>Population </em>section; Graham <em>et al. </em>2001). In 2002, there was 47 t of skate sold at the Melbourne fish market, which was predominantly comprised of Melbourne Skate (Treloar 2008). Large individuals are most vulnerable to hook and line and gillnets.&#160;This species does have some refuge from fishing in parts of their distribution and in coastal habitats, however, they are at higher risk to predation in inshore waters and are frequently preyed upon by Broadnose Sevengill Sharks (<em>Notorynchus cepedianus</em>) (Abrantes and Barnett 2011, Barnett and Semmens 2012).","The species is relatively rare in outlying areas of Western Australia and New South Wales; it probably has a narrow home range making it susceptible to localised depletion (P. Last pers. comm. 02/09/2008). Fishery independent surveys off southern New South Wales (NSW) showed that catch rates&#160;for grouped 'skates' declined by 83% between 1976–77 and 1996–1997 (Graham <em>et al.</em> 1997, Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). The survey from 1976 to 1977 on the upper continental  slope off Ulladulla and Eden mainly comprised Sydney Skate (<em>Dentiraja australis</em>)<em>, </em>Australian Longnose Skate (<em>Dentiraja confusa</em>) and the Melbourne Skate in the upper depth zone (200–275 m). In 1996–97 the survey was repeated in the same area and showed that numbers of all skates had been depleted. Off Ulladulla, the mean catch rate for all species in all depth zones in 1976–77 was 32.6 kg per hour and in 1996–97 it was 3.9 kg per hour. Off Eden, the mean catch for all species in all depth zones in 1976–77 was 32.4 kg per hour and in 1996–97 it was 5.0 kg per hour (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2001). When scaled to three generation lengths of the Melbourne Skate (45 years), these declines off Ulladulla and Eden indicate population reductions of 99% and 98%, respectively. Although these numbers indicate steep declines, this survey was performed on the upper slope, while this species is more prevalent on the shelf (M. Treloar unpubl. data 2020).

It is&#160;reported at depths of 154–1,370 m in Indonesian waters and 295–670 m in Australian waters (White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Last and Stevens 2009). In Indonesia, the species&#160;attains at least 101 cm total length (TL); male maturity is 62–67 cm TL; female maturity is ~80 cm TL (White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a). In eastern Australia, maximum recorded size is 93 cm TL for males and 116 cm TL for females; male maturity is ~65–70 cm TL (~ 22 years of age); female maturity is 80–85 cm TL (~ 26 years) (Rigby&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, K. Graham unpubl. data). Maximum age has been estimated as 28 years, although this was for an 86.6 cm TL male and not the maximum recorded size, so maximum age likely exceeds 30 years (Rigby<em> et al</em>. 2016). Females are lecithotrophic viviparous&#160;with a potentially non-continuous breeding cycle, giving birth to litters of 4–16 pups with a size at birth of ~24–25 cm TL (White <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Rigby <em>et al.</em> 2016, K. Graham unpubl. data). Gestation may be almost three years, based on the&#160;reproductive biology of the similar-sized Greeneye Spurdog (<em>Squalus chloroculus</em>) (Rochowski <em>et al.</em> 2015). The estimated maximum age and female age at maturity result in a generation length of 27 years.</p>","<p>The Philippine Spurdog is caught incidentally in various fisheries. Almost all trawlable ground on the upper continental slope off  central and southern New South Wales (NSW) is regularly fished by multigear  and multispecies fisheries in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and  Shark Fishery (SESSF) (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). There is relatively little fishing effort&#160;in deep water off northern NSW, Queensland, and off Western Australia, suggesting that threat levels are low throughout most of its&#160;Australian range. Although the effort is relatively minimal in Queensland, the species is possibly taken as bycatch in the Queensland Deepwater Fin Fish Fishery that uses droplines and trotlines, where dogfishes have been record but not identified to species (Sumpton <em>et al</em>. 2013). In southern Queensland, a developmental deepwater trawl fishery at 250–800 m may take the Philippine Spurdog as bycatch (Department of Environment 2016).<br/><br/>The species is frequently caught by deepwater demersal longline fisheries off parts of Indonesia (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006a) and the Philippines (Gaudiano and Alava 2003, Flores 2004). These fisheries usually operate in depths down to ~600 m, targeting deepwater sharks for their meat and liver-oil. Off the Philippines, mostly gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.) are caught, with Philippine Spurdog forming a relatively small part of the catch (Flores 2004). The potential expansion of long-lining into depths greater than the current&#160;maximum of ~600 m will further increase the fishing pressure on the species&#160;by exploiting that portion of the population previously afforded refuge at greater depths. This species is frequently landed at some fish markets in eastern and southern Taiwan where it is taken as bycatch in trawl and line fisheries, but no quantitative data are available to assess exploitation levels (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>","<p>Over a 20 year period (1976/77 to 1996/97), fisheries-independent trawl  surveys&#160;on upper-slope fishing grounds (220–605 m&#160;depth) between the Sydney (central New South Wales; NSW) and Eden-Gabo Island area (southern  NSW/northern Victoria) reported documented declines of ~97% of  ""greeneye dogsharks"" (Graham <em>et al</em>.  2001). Mean catch rates declined<strong> </strong>from&#160;44.8 kg/h in 1976/77  to&#160;1.2 kg/h in 1996/97, with this large reduction attributed to  commercial trawling on the central and southern NSW  upper slope (Graham <em>et al.</em> 2001). ""Greeneye dogsharks"" comprised three species: Greeneye Spurdog (<em>Squalus chloroculus</em>), Philippine Spurdog, and Eastern Longnose Spurdog (<em>Squalus grahami</em>),  with the latter two species the principal components of catches off  central NSW. The three species were equally  susceptible to trawling and Philippine Spurdog numbers would have been  greatly reduced&#160;at the southern end of its range off central NSW. Additionally, standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from commercial fisheries  catches indicated dramatic declines of ""greeneye dogsharks"" in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and  Shark Fishery (SESSF) from 1996–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).  These declines were equivalent to a 99% population reduction over  three generations (81 years) of the Philippine Spurdog. However, across most of its eastern Australian range (northern NSW and  Queensland), there is a relatively low level of fishing effort on the  continental slope suggesting that Philippine Spurdog numbers in these areas are not greatly impacted by commercial  fishing. This was confirmed in NSW by a&#160;longline survey in 2009, mainly on non-trawl grounds along the NSW upper slope  (depth 400–600 m), that caught&#160;464 Philippine Spurdog off northern and  central NSW but only a single specimen off southern NSW (south of ~35°)  (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2012). Currently, there is little or no  commercial fishing in upper-slope  depths off Western Australia (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018) and there is nothing to infer or suspect a population reduction in that area. There is anecdotal evidence from at  least  one landing site in Indonesia (Cilicap) that the unregulated  fisheries  have resulted in rapid declines in landings of squaloid shark  catches (White<em> et al. </em>2006b). <br/><br/>Based on actual levels of exploitation and documented declines in parts of the species' range and low fishing pressure elsewhere, it is suspected that the species has been subjected to an overall 30–40% population decline over the last three generations (81 years). <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

It has been heavily fished and utilised as trawl byproduct in the southern half of its range. There has been a 98–&gt;99% reduction of this species over three generation lengths, based on commercial trawl fishery data that was obtained during fisheries-independent trawl surveys from 1976–1977 and 1996–1997. These data only represent about a quarter of the total range of this species, and captures are rare from the areas of its northern range (where the species' abundance is suspected to be lower than in the central and southern parts of its range).<br/><br/>The Eastern Angel Shark is assessed as Vulnerable as it is marketable bycatch, there have been large population declines documented in one quarter of its total range, and the fishery responsible for the declines remains active with no conservation measures currently in place for this species. The Eastern Angel Shark&#160;potentially qualifies for a higher threat category, based on known declines where data are available, and therefore should be monitored throughout its range.","The Eastern Angel Shark occurs mainly on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 35 to 415 m (Last and Stevens 2009). There is limited information on its biology; it attains 130 cm total length (TL) with males mature by 91 cm TL and females at around 107 cm TL; size at birth is about 27–30 cm TL&#160;(Graham <em>et al.</em> 1997, Graham 1999, Last and Stevens 2009, K. Graham, The Australian Museum, pers. comm., 2003). Like the Australian Angel Shark (<em>S. australis</em>),&#160;this species is presumably&#160;lecithotrophic&#160;viviparous with litters up to 20 young (Michael 2001), although there  is no known specific data on litter sizes in the literature. Gestation  period is unknown but a similar species, the Pacific Angel Shark (<em>S. californica</em>), has a gestation period of 10 months (Michael 2001). Generation length is also unknown for this species, but&#160;the Pacific Angel Shark has&#160;an estimated generation length of 23 years (based on age data from Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1992).","Angel sharks are not very susceptible to line or mesh netting techniques, but are susceptible to trawling as they lay on the bottom (T.I. Walker, Department of Primary Industries Victoria, pers. comm. March 2003).<br/> <br/>Demersal trawling within the New South Wales Prawn Trawl Fishery and the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) in southeastern Australia between northern Victoria and central New South Wales continues to threaten its populations in the southern part of its range where it is thought to be more abundant than the northern part of its range.<br/><br/>Graham <em>et al</em>.

It is found inshore to a depth of 439 m. Little is known of its biology, although litter size is known to be small (up to seven young). There is also little specific information on threats and catches in fisheries throughout much of the species' range, but given the intense and unregulated fishing pressure known to exist on large batoid species across much of its range, particularly in Southeast Asia, the particular sensitivity of this species to various fishing methods, its limiting life history characteristics, and the general declining health of coral reef ecosystems (its main habitat) throughout its Indo-West Pacific distribution, the species is inferred to have undergone a decline in population size of at least 30% over the past three generations (65 years), and is therefore assessed globally as Vulnerable (VU A2d).<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is considered Least Concern due to protection afforded in marine parks and the effective use of turtle exclusion devices in northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries, which should limit the catch of the species there. Similarly, it is assessed as Least Concern in the Maldives where it has a high ecotourism value and is thus afforded protection through the prohibition of the export of rays and ray products.","The Blotched Fantail Ray is benthic around coral reef habitats and on sand substrates, from the surf zone offshore to 439 m depth (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989, Last and Compagno 1999). It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm disc width (DW) (Last and Stevens 2009). Males mature at 100-110 cm DW (W. White, unpubl. data); size at birth is 30-35 cm DW (Last and Stevens 2009). It is a viviparous species, with reported litter size of up to seven young (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989). Age data are not available, but generation length can be estimated using data from another large dasyatid, the Brown Stingray (<em>Dasyatis lata</em>), females of which mature at 15 years and reach 28 years (Dale and Holland 2012), giving an estimated generation length of 21.5 years.","The Blotched Fantail Ray is caught by line gear and trawl throughout its range. Throughout Southeast Asia there is significant fishing pressure on large batoids, and whether targeted or taken as bycatch, all are landed and utilized. For example, in Indonesia (see White and Dharmadi 2007) the Blotched Fantail Ray is regularly taken in low numbers by tangle netters operating out of Jakarta (Java), Bali and Merauke (West Papua), while demersal longliners that operate out of Lombok and large pair trawlers operating out of Merauke irregularly take adults. The latter fishery has consisted of some 650 vessels and pressure is intense where the vessels operate in the Arafura Sea. Low numbers of juveniles are also taken by prawn and fish trawlers around Indonesia, particularly in the Java Sea.<br/><br/>A prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea. Detailed species composition data for the bycatch is not currently available, but this is currently being investigated (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm., February 2015).<br/><br/>Overall, fishing pressure is significant (and generally unregulated) over most of the species' distribution throughout Asia and across its Indian Ocean range (India, East Africa, etc.). Additional pressure exists on its habitat in that region due to destructive fishing practices (dynamite fishing) and run-off affecting coral reef systems, the main habitat of the species.<br/><br/>In Australia, the species is a discarded bycatch in demersal prawn trawl fisheries. In the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), the Blotched Fantail Ray had a mean catch rate of 0.4 individuals/km² and was classified as amongst the least sustainable elasmobranch bycatch species in the fishery (this assessment combines the species' susceptibility to capture and mortality due to trawling, and the capacity of the species to recover after depletion by trawling) (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002). The mandatory use of turtle exclusions devices (TEDs) in prawn trawl fisheries operating off northern Australia (including the NPF and the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery) should limit the catch of this species in these fisheries.<br/><br/>The Blotched Fantail Ray is taken by recreational surf and ski-boat anglers off South Africa, but is apparently released unharmed (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989). It is also a bycatch of offshore trawlers off southern Africa (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 1989). Details of catches elsewhere in its range are lacking.","Nothing is known of the current population size or structure, nor of the degree of connectivity across subpopulations across this ray's wider distribution.<br/><br/> The species is inferred  to have undergone a population size reduction of at least  30% across its global range over the  past 65 years (three  generations), based on the intense and unregulated fishing pressure known to exist on  large batoid species across much of the Blotched Fantail Ray's range (particularly in  Southeast Asia - see the Threats section below), the sensitivity of this species to various  fishing methods, and the  general declining health of coral reef ecosystems (its main habitat)  throughout its Indo-West Pacific distribution.<br/><br/>Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Blotched Fantail Ray in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"The Blotched Fantail Ray has a wide Indo-West Pacific distribution including East Africa, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, India, Southeast Asia, China, southern Japan, northern Australia and western Pacific islands (Last and Stevens 2009).",This species is utilized for its meat and cartilage (White <em>et al.</em> 2006).,Marine,"The Blotched Fantail Ray is afforded protection in some regions in marine protected areas. These include the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, and in marine reserves created around diving sites in the Maldives in recognition of the high value of sharks and rays to tourism (Anderson and Waheed 2001). The Maldives banned the export of rays in 1995 and the export of ray skins in 1996. Again, this was to protect the tourism resource (Anderson and Waheed 2001).<br/> <br/>The Gulf of Papua prawn trawl fishery is managed under national laws and regulations (Papua New Guinea), and there are some seasonal closures in place; although bycatch reduction devices are not currently in place, there are plans to implement in the near future (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm., February 2015).<br/><br/>Batoids cannot be retained in northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries and this species is therefore discarded if caught. The use of turtle exclusion devices will be effective at reducing catches of at least large individuals (see Brewer <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><br/>The recreational line fishery in South Africa is managed by a bag limit of one species per person per day for unspecified chondrichthyans, which includes the Blotched Fantail Ray.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species&#160;is widespread in the Indo-West Pacific region where&#160;intensive and largely unmanaged net and trawl fisheries occur (with the exception of Australia).<br/><br/>While life history data are not available, the life history of a related species, the Brown Stingray (<em>Dasyatis lata</em>), suggests that this species may have a long generation length (21.5 years).&#160;Fishing pressure is heavy in its known, shallow-water habitat, and fisheries are likely to catch this species if present. Many shark and ray fisheries and stocks in the region are known to be over-exploited, with catches declining. Market surveys indicate that this species has&#160;decreased in abundance in parts of the centre of its range for which comparative data are available such as the Gulf of Thailand. It is also a commonly caught and heavily used species in Indonesia&#160;which is a global centre for intense shark and ray fishing and over-exploitation.<br/><br/>Based on its shallow water habitat preferences, long estimated generation time, global declines in chondrichthyan landings of at least 20% over the past 12 years, and the fact that the Indo-West Pacific region is a region with some of the most poorly managed and intensely fished waters, a population reduction of greater than 30% over three generations is inferred for the Porcupine Ray, resulting in an assessment of Vulnerable.&#160;In Australia, the species is assessed as Least Concern as has no commercial value in Australian waters and is seldom caught. While the species was occasionally captured in commercial trawl fisheries, the introduction of trawl exclusion devices has significantly decreased the bycatch of large batoids in Australian trawl fisheries. Marine protected areas at Ningaloo Reef and the Great Barrier Reef are likely to provide effective protection for this species.","Although very wide ranging, this ray appears to be uncommon compared to various species of dasyatid rays&#160;which are sympatric with it. Occurrence appears to be patchy with localised hotspots (Chin 2014). Juveniles appear to be site-attached, and highly resident to small areas of shallow coastal mud and mangrove habitats (Cerutti-Pereyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). It has been recorded from coral reefs, sandy reef lagoons, beaches, mud flats and mangroves, at depths of ~1 m to at least 30 m (O'Shea 2013, Cerutti-Pereyra&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Chin 2014).<br/><br/>There is virtually no information available on life history parameters for this species. Age at maturity, longevity, average reproductive age, generation time and average annual fecundity are all unknown.&#160;Attempts to collect size-at-age data from vertebral counts have proved difficult due to the fragile nature of vertebra (O'Shea 2013). The Porcupine Ray reaches a maximum size of at least 115 cm disc width (DW) with females mature by ~100 cm DW and males at ~90 cm DW (Last and Stevens 2009).&#160;Using data from the Brown Stingray (<em>Dasyatis lata</em>),&#160;a related species of similar size from the Pacific&#160;as a proxy, generation time for the Porcupine Ray is inferred to be 21.5 years.","The species is presumably largely taken as bycatch in unregulated fisheries in nearshore waters. It has been recorded as a high value catch in Indonesian net fisheries (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). It appears to have disappeared or become extremely rare (compared to certain other batoids) in the batoid catches landed in Bangkok from the Gulf of Thailand in recent decades (Compagno and Cook, unpubl. data).&#160;This suggests probable local over-exploitation here and possibly also in the Bay of Bengal.&#160;Similar trends are likely to be occurring or will occur in other areas where batoids are taken in multi-species fisheries. Certainly, demersal fishery resources in the Gulf of Thailand and Southeast Asia have been severely depleted from historical levels (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Human modification and degradation of the ray's habitat is also possibly occurring in some of the more highly populated and polluted coastal areas as a result of human influences. The loss of coastal habitats such as mangroves may be of particular concern for this species which is suspected to have highly localized habitat use (A. Chin, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>This species was occasionally taken in northern Australian trawl fisheries (Brewer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the introduction of turtle exclusion devices appears to have successfully excluded this species from continuing capture in trawl nets (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Porcupine Ray is considered to be potentially one of the most vulnerable chondrichthyans to the impacts of climate change in northern Australia (Chin <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Little is known about the population status, trends or structure of this species, although the Porcupine Ray is considered to be an uncommon species.<br/><br/>Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014).

It is an inshore species that mostly inhabits depths less than 100 m and is particularly susceptible to inshore fisheries. Inshore populations of similar species (e.g. Whitecheek Shark <em>C. dussumieri</em>) have declined dramatically in other regions of the world. Although the Indonesian Whaler Shark likely matures early and breeds annually, the low reproductive capacity (usual litter size of two pups) makes it susceptible to over-exploitation. The limited extent of the species' distribution combined with the intensive fishing pressure across its entire range, as well as habitat degradation, lead to a suspected population decline of &gt;30% over the past three generations (12 years) with further population reduction suspected over the future three generations lengths (2018-2030) based on potential levels of exploitation and a decline in the quality of habitat. Thus, the species is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd+3cd.","The Indonesian Whaler Shark is a small inshore species that mostly inhabits shallow waters to depths of 100 m (White 2012).

Males mature at 71-78 cm TL and females mature at 76 cm TL (Yano <em>et al</em>. 2005, White 2007, White 2012). The species is viviparous usually with litters of two pups, rarely four, and a size at birth of 34-38 cm TL (Teshima and Mizue 1973, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). The species is assumed to breed each year, based on the annual breeding of the closely-related Australian Blackspot Shark (<em>C. coatesi</em>)  (Stevens and McLoughlin 1991). Age and growth data  are not available  for the Indonesian Whaler Shark, but generation length is suspected  to be around four  years based on the Australian Blackspot Shark that has  an estimated maximum age of 6.5 years and age at maturity of two years  (Smart <em>et al. </em>2013).<p></p>","<p>The Indonesian Whaler Shark is commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Indonesian Whaler Shark are suspected given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal  fisheries in the region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006) as a result of ongoing intensive inshore fishing effort.&#160;Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is among the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996).

Threat processes degrade coral reefs in the Red Sea; however, the overall status of Red Sea corals is unknown due to the lack of studies in several countries. In the Red Sea, corallivory via outbreaks of the crown of thorns starfish is particularly damaging to acroporid corals, which is a preferred habitat and food source of this species. Pollution has also damaged acroporids in the northern Red Sea in the past, and may have caused population decline in this species. Positive recovery for most degraded reefs has been observed in a large portion of Red Sea corals (Saudi Arabia), but there are concerns for reduced resiliency if future coastal development is not managed to ensure the health of nearby reefs. Its AOO and EOO are too large to meet or nearly meet the Red List thresholds under Criteria B, and serious declines in population on a global level are not known to have occurred. It is dependent on <em>Acropora </em>coral reefs and is therefore highly susceptible to habitat loss. A similar species, <em>O. longirostris</em>, has reportedly undergone local extinctions in Okinawa, Japan, due to habitat loss. Of the 103 <em>Acropora</em> species occurring in the Indo-Pacific, 20% are listed as Vulnerable, and another 25% as Near Threatened. Due to its direct dependency on <em>Acropora</em> reefs, we infer that <em>O. halli</em> may experience projected population declines of at least 30% over the next three generations. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c. Research and monitoring is needed on the status of its population.","This species is an obligate on shallow coral reefs, and prefers acroporid corals (Abel 1960, Edwards and Rosewell 1981, Wüest 1993, Brooker <em>et al</em>. 2011). It feeds exclusively on coral polyps (Wüest 1993) and often occurs in pairs.&#160;Its maximum total length is 4.6 cm (Goren and Spanier 1985). Although life history data are limited, a similar species (<em>O. longirostri</em>s) lives to about two years; therefore, we infer that 10 years is greater than three generation lengths.","Data that would inform coral reef status and management are badly lacking in most Red Sea countries (Berumen<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013). According to Burke <em>et al. </em>(2011), coral cover in the Red Sea is in relatively good condition. Compared to complex reef systems elsewhere in the world, Red Sea reefs are particularly thermo-tolerant and therefore, may be more resilient to severe bleaching events (Berumen<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013). However, severe bleaching was observed in 2011 on inshore reefs in the central Red Sea (Furby&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), which may mean that bleaching events have been occurring but were not formally reported due to limited observer effort (Berumen<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2013). The three major drivers of coral mortality in the Saudi Arabian portion of the Red Sea are coral bleaching, coral disease and corallivory. Corallivory by the&#160;crown of thorns starfish especially impacts acroporid corals. Although these reefs have undergone degradation over the last several decades, most show signs of recovery&#160;and high recruitment of juveniles (Bruckner and Dempsey 2015). Reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba have declined due to pollution from increased coastal development, including domestic and industrial effluents, dust from fertilizers from a harbor-loading station and oil spills (Fishelson 1995). Of the 103 species of <em>Acropora</em> occurring within the Red Sea, 20 (20%) are listed in a threatened category (Vulnerable), and another 26 (25%) are Near Threatened. Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenter <em>et al. </em>2008).","Information on its population is limited. It can be somewhat locally abundant in its preferred habitat in Sudan (Edwards and Rosewell 1981). Other studies indicate its abundance is relatively low compared to other endemics (DiBattista <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fishelson (1995) reported that this species was not recorded during a visual survey that followed serious coral degradation in the Gulf of Aqaba, but comparable context to previous surveys was not provided. Due to its direct dependency on Acropora reefs and the ongoing degradation of those corals due to bleaching, we infer that <em>O. halli</em> will experience projected population declines of at least 30% over the next 10 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Oxymonacanthus halli</em> is endemic to the Red Sea (Matsuura 2015). Its depth range is zero to 11 metres (FishNet2 database accessed April 2017).

Species in the genus <em>Phallostethus</em> are small, slender and nearly transparent surface swimming fishes. Males have a complex reproductive organ called the priapium which is used to hold females during internal fertilisation. Females lay fertilised eggs onto substrates via an adhesive filament (White <em>et al.</em> 1984, Shibukawa <em>et al. </em>2012).","The Muar River, which is the only known location of this species, is threatened by pollution from industrial, domestic and agricultural sources.

PAHs are known to be highly soluble and toxic, and can bioaccumulate in fish species (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour 2016). The Muar River also receives elevated levels of nutrients and sediments (Huang<em> et al.</em> 2015), and residents along the river have raised concerns over sand mining which has made the river muddy and caused incidents of fish dies offs (Yassin <em>et al.</em> 2013).

It is also associated with artificial reef structures (Frazer and Lindberg 1994, Vose and Nelson 1994, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1995, Kurz 1995, Simmons 2008). It has a wide bathymetric distribution (Ofori-Adu and Koranteng 1993), usually between 15–55 m depth in coastal waters, but the preferred depth range is 30–50 m (ATLANTNIRO 1980). Adults drift along the bottom either alone or in small groups, while the juveniles drift at the surface with <em>Sargassum</em>. High abundances of small fish (1.3 - 10.6 cm standard length) have been recorded from <em>Sargassum </em>mats in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in the pelagic zone from May to August (Wells and Rooker 2004).&#160;It&#160;occurs mainly in the thermocline at an average depth of 47 m, with temperature and oxygen values below the values found in shallow waters in clay and silt substrate (Bianchi 1992a).&#160;In the Gulf of Mexico, adults inhabit reef areas (natural and artificial reefs, low or high-relief reefs) between 10-106 m&#160;(Smith 1976, Johnson and Saloman 1984, Ingram 2001, K.

This species is a multiple-batch spawner, starting as early as May and peaking during June and July, and with a 1:2 male to female ratio. Males and females both reach sexual maturity at 250 mm fork length (FL), but males are at age-1 and females are at age-2 (Wilson&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>1995, Ingram 2001). Eggs are incubated in demersal nests within 12 to 58 hours, after which they enter the plankton (Thresher 1984). Between the sizes 1 to 8 cm (SL), it is associated with&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sargassum</span>&#160;(Ingram 2001). It is sexually dimorphic, with males being significantly larger than females (Ingram 2001, Moore 2001,&#160;Simmon 2008). In West Africa, spawning occurred from October to December with a peak in the warmer months (November and December). The onset of spawning was characterized by relatively short preceding period of average minimum sea-surface temperature of 22.6 degree C, normally occurring in July. First time spawners were 13.3-15.7 cm (FL), 50.0-70.5 g in weight and one year old (Ofori-Danson 1990).&#160;In Brazil, spawning occurs from November to February south of Sao Paolo (Bernardes and Dias 2000).&#160;In the Gulf of Mexico, the spawning season is estimated to be from July to October (Dooley 1972). It has a high fecundity (Ingram 2001, Simmons 2008). Batch fecundities in fish from the eastern Gulf of Mexico ranged from 213,912 to 1,172,854 oocytes from fish ranging in size from 267 to 388 mm FL, and relative batch fecundity had a mean of 13,809 oocytes per gram ovary and ranged from 6,318 to 24,188 oocytes per gram (Hood and Johnson 1997). One-year-old males (&gt;250 mm fork length) and two-year-old females (&gt;250 mm fork length) exhibit seasonal maturation cycles associated with spawning. The mean number of spawnings (± standard error) per spawning season was estimated to be 24.3 (± 4.1). Mean total annual fecundity (± standard error) was estimated to be 17,071,634 eggs year-1 (± 2,010,787).<br/><br/>The maximum size is 52 cm total length (Aggrey-Fynn 2009) and maximum age is at least 16 years (SEDAR 2005).&#160;Off southern Brazil, the longevity was&#160;estimated at 11 years for males and females.&#160;The mean annual mortality rate (based on number of fish at age) ranged from 0.32 to 0.53&#160;(Johnson and Saloman 1984).&#160;Longevity is estimated at between 12 and 16 years old; using a maximum age based estimator with low prediction error (M = 4.899t<sup>−0.916</sup>: Then <em>et al.</em> 2014), the estimated adult natural mortality rate is 0.39-0.50. Age at first maturity is 1-2 years of age. Using the estimator for generation length of 1/adult mortality + age at first reproduction results in a generation length of 4 years; incorporating age-specific fecundity (estimated for the Gulf of Mexico, 170289e<sup>0.3159*Age</sup>: SEDAR 2011) resulted in a generation length of 8 years. Thus, the time window for calculating population declines over three generation lengths is 12-24 years.","There have been declines in abundance of this species in the Gulf of Guinea, Gulf of Mexico and Brazil due to overexploitation.","<strong>U.S. Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/>The Gray Triggerfish is managed as a single stock in the Gulf of Mexico. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences from five localities across this species’ exploited range in U.S. waters revealed low-levels of heterogeneity, which is consistent with the management of this species as a single stock (Antoni <em>et al</em>. 2011). Microsatellite markers have recently been developed for finer-resolution studies of population structure (Antoni and Saillant 2012, Sorenson 2013).<br/><br/>Projections of possible future condition of the stock under different fishing scenarios were made using parameter outputs from the ASPIC (A Stock Production Model Incorporating Covariates) models one and two using 1998 as the last year in the assessment and 1999 as the first year of management. To determine whether or not the stock could be rebuilt (B/BMSY =1.0) within a ten year time frame, projections were carried out to the years 1999-2008. These projections indicate that the stock may be overfished, that overfishing is still occurring, and that catches should at least be held constant or preferably reduced to bring the stock back to healthy levels. The production model analyses utilized to project the stock trajectory indicated that current fishing mortality rates were not sustainable (Valle <em>et al</em>. 2001). Although management efforts are in place for the Gulf of Mexico population (see the Conservation Actions section for detailed management measures), no indications of population recovery were evident as of 2014. The next benchmark assessment for <em>B. capriscus</em> is scheduled for 2015.<br/><br/>An aggregated production model indicated that there were uncertainties in the ASPIC models used, due to sensitivity of the model. Robust conclusions from the model results cannot be determined, as the data were not adequate to resolve the status of the stock; however, nearly every run conducted resulted in the stock being overfished and experiencing overfishing. It is noted that this model should be explored further (Nowlis and Saul 2005).<br/><br/>A benchmark assessment was performed in 2006, and updated in 2011 using the same statistical catch-at-age-model (SSASPM). Results suggest the stock is overfished and experiencing overfishing. The stock was approaching an overfishing condition in 2005, but was not yet overfished. A rebuilding plan was established 2008 to rebuild the stock within 10 years, but there is currently no evidence of substantial improvements in stock status. The ratio of SSBcurrent/SSBMSY ranged from 0.24-0.39. Using the Gulf-wide shrimp effort model, which was evaluated as containing the least amount of uncertainty, SSB in 2010 was estimated at 6.90E+11, which is roughly 60% below the SSBMSY proxy of 1.78E+12. Fcurrent in 2010 was estimated at 0.35, which is above FMSY of 0.34. Estimates of fishing mortality ranged from 0.53 to 0.35 depending on the model used in the 2011 update (in 2006 fishing mortality was estimated at 0.435). The overall trend in SSB from 1963 (when the stock was assumed to be unfished) to 2010 is one of decline – current SSB is roughly 15-20% of original, un-fished biomass. The preferred model from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico stock assessment estimated that spawning stock biomass declined by 43-58% during the past three generation lengths (12-14 years) (see table A-24 in SEDAR 2011). The continuity model estimated that spawning stock biomass declines were slightly higher, 62-69% over three generation lengths (see Table A-1 in SEDAR 2011). In addition, models suggested recruitment has also decreased; depending on model specifications, the declines range from 51-68% to&#160; 84-87% in the last 12-24 years (see Tables A-24 and A-1 in SEDAR 2011, respectively). <br/><br/>Projections of SSB for Gray Triggerfish in the Gulf of Mexico were generated using the 'Gulf-wide Shrimp Effort' model. Under each of three scenarios for which SSB was projected, SSB was expected to increase. Recovery periods under the no fishing scenario ranged from 3 to 4.5 years. However, there is concern that the trend of steadily declining recruitment and the low recruitment levels in recent years were not reflected in the model, which uses the estimated spawner-recruit relationship, and thus projections of recovery may be overly optimistic. The Allowable Biological Catch advice for 2012 and 2013 was based on the assumption that recruitment was at recent (2005-2009) levels, rather than based on the spawner-recruit relationship (SEDAR 2011); this was thought a more precautionary approach to Grey Triggerfish harvest. <br/><br/>Recreational landings in numbers of fish by state (Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and Florida) and fishing mode were estimated for the period 1986-1998, landings peaked in 1990, followed by a steady decline. The majority of annual landings since 1986 have been reported from the West Coast of Florida, followed by Louisiana. Landings from the charter boat mode have dominated recreational landings most years. Landings in weight by year and state were estimated for the commercial sector for the period 1986-1998 with a trend similar to the recreational sector, but with a peak in 1993 followed by a steady decline. The greatest proportion of commercial landings has been reported for the west coast of Florida, followed by Louisiana. <br/>Southern Gulf of Mexico: Balistes capriscus is a minor commercial species along the Mexican coast in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is primarily utilized in small-scale artisanal fisheries (a more important commercial fishery for this species is along the Mexican Caribbean coast). Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations have declined in this region, but no quantitative data are available at this time. <br/><br/><strong>U.S. Atlantic coast</strong><br/>This species is not targeted by fisheries in this region (Kellison <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mean annual catch per unit effort (CPUE) in the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program during the fall and summer trawl surveys from 1987 to 2010 indicate no clear trend (NOAA unpub. data). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was greater in the 1970s (2.5% of catch) than in 2005-2006 (0.4% of catch) at specific capture site (210 Rock) in Onslow Bay, North Carolina (Ruderhausen et al. 2008). It is a dominant component within Sargassum off North Carolina (Casazza and Ross 2008). <br/><br/><strong>Brazil</strong><br/>In Brazil, it has been intensively caught in the industrial fleet over the past two decades. Total landings decreased by 10.5%, with landings from 1996-2005 at 29.64 t and from 2001-2005 at 26.54 t (Ataliba <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has been exploited off the state of São Paolo since the 1960s. In the past, it was included in the miscellaneous fish category, but in the last 15 years, it has become a very important fishery resource and is currently one of the most commonly caught commercial species (Bernardes 1988, Castro 2000). It was previously one of the most important species in the fisheries of Espirito Santo State, but overexploitation has since caused it to become commercially extinct (Freitas Netto and Di Beneditto 2010, Freitas Netto <em>et al</em>. in press). The use of gill nets may have caused the declines in population (Freitas Netto 2004). About 46% of the catches were composed of immature fishes, which increases the likelihood for growth overfishing to occur (Bernardes and Dias 2000, Bernardes 2001).<br/><br/>Landings by state changed substantially from 1986-2005. The majority of the landings came from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with generally lower landings from Santa Catarina and Rio de Grande Sul. Landings have declined by approximately 95% over 20 years in Sao Paulo and Rio de Grande Sul, while Santa Catarina has no trend, and landings increased by approximately 200% in Rio de Janeiro (Ataliba <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, increased landings in Brazil may be due to declines in more traditional fisheries (Ataliba <em>et al.</em> 2009) and therefore, may not clearly reflect the status of the population.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Atlantic</strong><br/>FAO capture production list annual Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic landings for this species from 1992-2009 as ranging from one tonne to 432 tonnes. Tunisia and Portugal have the highest catches from 1993-2009, with an average of 77 tonnes (1993-2009) and 66 tonnes (1999-2009), respectively (FAO 2014). Libya has the highest catch recorded in 2009 at 432 tonnes. Capture production for triggerfishes in the eastern central Atlantic show pronounced declines in catch in Ghana and Togo. Furthermore, declines in catches were also recorded for the Soviet Union from 1970-1989 in the divisions: Cape Verde, Sahara and Sherbro. In Ireland, there was an increase in triggerfish abundance between 1989-1991, with at least 184 specimens recorded, representing 53.6% of the total number of specimens documented (343) since the first record in 1845. Large numbers of specimens were reportedly sighted by SCUBA divers and captured on rod and line by anglers. It is unknown if the increase in triggerfish numbers represent a real change in the species overall abundance in Irish water or an increase in recording effort (Quigley <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/><em>Balistes capriscus</em> appears to be one of the most abundant near-bottom pelagic species occurring in the Sierra Leone waters. Results of two surveys conducted by the UNIDO/GEF Gulf of Guinea LME Project and FAO/NORAD in Moree, Ghana indicate that this species is one of the top 20 species encountered, indicating possible recovery of the stock of this species in Ghana (Koranteng 2000). In Cote-d'Ivoire, this species was very abundant from 1983-1986 during the hot season, but then disappeared from 1993 (there was no survey conducted between 1987 and 1992). There was apparently no link of the abundance of <em>B. capriscus</em> to the usual physical and biological environmental parameters. This was the opposite of the pattern that was observed in Ghana by Koranteng (1998), where species abundance was higher in colder regime and declined when waters warmed up (Joanny and Menard 2002).<br/><br/>In Ghana, from ~1973 and following a decline in the sardinella fishery in the western Gulf of Guinea, there was an increase in landings of this species (as <em>Balistes carolinensis</em>) in the Ghanian demersal fishery. In 1979-1980, the demersal component of triggerfish assessed in bottom trawl surveys was put at 99,000 t (or 57.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), or 62% of the total demersal fish biomass in Ghanian coastal waters (Koranteng and Pauly 2002). In May 1981-March 1982, the estimated biomass was between 314,000 and 500,000 t (Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982, Ofori-Adu 1987, 1994, Aggrey-Fynn 2007). Triggerfish catch drastically declined from 18,610 tonnes in 1986 to 2 tonnes in 1995 in Ghanaian waters, and recent report from CECAF capture production&#160; (FAO 2008) show that the annual catches of triggerfish show two separate peaks between 1972 and 2003. The first catch peak (12,563 tons) occurred in 1979, and the second peak (17,250 tons) in 1986/87. Before 1979, triggerfish catch levels were from 2 830 tons (1972) to 9,138 tons (1977). In between 1979 and 1986/87, triggerfish catch fell to ‘regular or stable’ annual levels (5,000–8,000 tons/year). After 1987, triggerfish catch experienced a ‘sharp’ decline in 1988 to 2,862 tons which continued to decline, indicating that inshore triggerfish catch generally increased with inshore effort. Inshore catch decreased dramatically from 1979-80 at relatively same effort and continued to decrease from 1980-84, catch increased in 1984-1986 at increased effort and decreased progressively with effort from 1987-91 (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). The triggerfish biomass was highest in 1985 and decreased afterwards up to 1991. The biomass decrease was quite significant from 1987-89 at virtually the same effort; and 1989-91 there was virtually no biomass of the triggerfish resource in Ghanaian coastal waters (Koranteng 1998, Aggrey-Fynn 2007).<br/><br/><em>Balistes capriscus</em> is an important economic resource in the Gulf of Guinea. It was recorded to have reached maximum abundance in the late 1970s to early 1980s in the Canary Current (Caverivière 1982, Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982). This species was the most abundant demersal/semi-pelagic species in the 1980s (Mensah and Quaatey 2002). At the time that this species dominated in the Gulf of Guinea ecosystem, it corresponded to a period of low temperature and high salinity, and a decrease in the total density of sciaenids, some lutjanids were also displaced by the expanding triggerfish population with the latter occupying the niche of the snappers (Koranteng 1998, Koranteng 2001, Koranteng and Pauly 2002). In 1982-1990, the <em>Balistes capriscus</em> stock declined and accounted for only 4% of the total catch of the species and the other groups in the sparid species assemblage in the Gulf of Guinea (Koranteng 2001a). This species dominated the Gulf of Guinea ecosystem, especially from Ghana to Sierra Leone, for nearly 20 years, displacing <em>Brachydeuterus auritus</em> as the most abundant species off Ghana. For reasons that have yet to be determined, triggerfish declined in abundance from ~1988, and only a few specimens were caught in surveys conducted in the 1990s (Koranteng and Pauly 2002). There are reported to be two separate stocks in the Gulf of Guinea with no apparent interchange- the eastern stock which occurred off Ghana and the western stock off Guinea Bissau and Guinea (Stromme <em>et al</em>. 1982, Stromme 1983, Mensah and Quaatey 2002); both have almost disappeared (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). To address this gap, catch and biological data were obtained for this species was obtained from trawl surveys conducted in 2005 off the waters of Benin, Togo, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, results of the study indicate that the distributions of the Grey Triggerfish had not changed despite the decline documented for nearly two decades. Moreover, the depth distribution, modal size classes and growth were comparable to previous studies before the decline (Aggrey-Fynn 2009).<br/><br/>Grey Triggerfish exploitation ratio (0.2727) indicate that the triggerfish resource is underexploited as compared to the exploitation ratio of 0.67 derived from 1980 growth results of Gray Triggerfish (Aggrey-Fynn 2007). Thus, the triggerfish resource might not have been overexploited before their disappearance. Though current exploitation rates show an under-exploited fishery, the <em>Balistes</em> fishery has not revived in Ghana. Environmental forcing, specifically the intense cooling along the coast of Ghana in recent years and triggerfish migration from cold coastal waters to warm offshore waters, and the unusual minimum mean temperatures experienced in 1979 and 1987 that have not been recorded again in coastal waters of Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn 2007) may be impacting the populations.",Decreasing,"<em>Balistes capriscus</em> is widespread in the Atlantic Ocean. In the western Atlantic, it is known from Nova Scotia (Canada) south along the U.S. coast, Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Argentina, including Trinidade Island (Simon <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the eastern Atlantic, it is known from Ireland south into the Mediterranean Sea, the Azores, the Canary Islands, the Islands of Madeira, and along West Africa to Angola, including offshore oceanic islands in this region. Its depth range is 0-110 m.","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Balistes capriscus</span> is important to both commercial and recreational fisheries. Until recently, it was not considered a desirable catch by most fishers; however, the decline in other reef fish stocks (e.g., red snapper and groupers) has probably caused an increased targeting of this and other under-utilized species (Valle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2001). It&#160;is an important economic resource in the Gulf of Guinea. It can be taken in bottom trawls and traps, as well as on handlines and is generally marketed fresh (Matsuura 2002).",Marine,"In U.S. waters, this species is managed under the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council and under the Gulf of Mexico 1981 Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) and subsequent amendments. In 1984, prohibitions on roller trawls and fish traps may have reduced catch of this species. In 1999, a minimum size limit and a 20-fish aggregate bag limit for reef fishes&#160;was established. A commercial quota was set to 80,000 pounds for 2008, 93,000 for 2009, and 106,000 pounds for 2010. Following the 2011 stock assessment, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council established measures that included reductions in total allowable catch to end overfishing and rebuild the stock by 2017. The implementation of Amendment 37 established a closed season from June 1- July 31, and reduced the bag limit to two Gray Triggerfish per person.&#160;<br/><br/>It is not known to be well-managed where it is exploited elsewhere in its range.&#160;<br/><p><br/><br/><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global
97667070,190422,Mola mola,Vulnerable,A4bd,2015,2011-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widely distributed. It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic and is captured in large numbers as bycatch in fisheries using long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls in a number of widely distributed fisheries. In some fisheries, the catch of <em>Mola mola</em> exceeds that of the target species. Preliminary calculations from three of these fisheries (two South African longline fisheries, and the USA Southwest Region drift net fishery), indicate 300, 26,000 and 340,000 individual <em>M. mola</em> per fishery are made each year and it is likely that other fisheries using these same methods are taking large, but unreported, bycatch of <em>M. mola</em> throughout the majority of its range. In some areas, substantial declines (up to 100%) have been documented, likely driven by the high bycatch. Based on these declines and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over three generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future. Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable under A4bd. Future monitoring and research on its basic biological variables such as age at maturity, generation time, etc. is recommended.<br/></p>","<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is an oceanodromous, pelagic-oceanic species that occurs in subtropical waters between depths of 30 and 480 m, but is usually between 30 and 70 m (Powell 2001, Riede 2004, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Adults are found on slopes adjacent to deep water where they come in for shelter and to seek out cleaner fishes (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). It&#160;is an active swimmer capable of highly directional movements and horizontal movements independent of the current (Cartamil and Lowe 2004); it&#160;uses its anal and dorsal fins as a pair of wings (Pope&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).&#160;It feeds on fishes, molluscs, zooplankton, jellyfish, crustaceans, and brittle stars (Clemens and Wilby 1961, Scott and Scott 1988, Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). Cartamil and Lowe (2004) observed a diel pattern in depth&#160;utilization, with fish residing in the warmer mixed layer above or within the thermocline at night and repeatedly diving beneath the thermocline into cooler water during the day (Californian waters, July-September 2001). Hays<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>(2009) also noted that although individual sunfish showed a range of preferred depth that altered over time, they were still moving up and down the water column and regularly returning to close to the surface. Although its exact function has yet to be resolved, Cartamil and Lowe (2004) proposed that periodic returns to the surface in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> may imply some form of behavioural thermo-regulation i.e. prolonged time in cold waters necessitates time spent at the surface to re-warm. This may explain the frequent observations of ocean sunfish observed 'basking' or swimming on their sides at the surface during the day (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). Conversely, Sims <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009a) argued that extensive vertical movements may simply reflect a crepuscular searching strategy when prey are descending or ascending, with sunfish attempting to locate maximum prey abundances at this time. It has been also been suggested more generally that large amplitude dives or ascents of large pelagic fish and other vertebrates during prey tracking may represent prey searching behaviour (Shepard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006)&#160;characterized&#160;by extensive movements to new locations (Sims<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008).&#160;It exhibits sexual dimorphism; females are larger than males (Pope<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<br/>Maximum total length is 333 cm (Claro 1994); maximum published weight is 2.3 t (Roach 2003); all animals larger than 250 cm TL are female (Nakatsubo 2008).&#160;Very few studies have been conducted on the reproductive biology of ocean sunfish (Pope <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). In Japan,the spawning period&#160;is estimated between August and October and the same study also identified asynchronous egg development, suggesting it is a multiple spawner (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007).&#160;The lifespan or reproductive age of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> under natural conditions is unknown, although captive animals have been maintained for more than 8 years (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). A growth curve derived from repeated measurements of captive specimens estimated an individual with a total length of 3 m would be about 20 years old (Nakatsubo 2008). Recent work used growth band pairs in vertebrae to age the closely related sharptail mola <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. lanceolatus</span> caught in the eastern Taiwan fishery (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The age estimates ranged between &gt;2 and &gt;23 years for females and &gt;1 and &gt;16 years for males (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). &#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mola mola</span> is famously the most fecund of all vertebrates (Carwardine 1995) with a 137 cm female containing an estimated 300 million eggs (Schmidt 1921). By necessity, these eggs are very small (mean diameter 0.13 cm; Gudger 1936) and so <em>M. mola</em> growth is staggering. For the 0.25 cm larva to grow to a 3 m adult requires an increase in mass of 60 million times (Gudger 1936). A more atypical captive growth rates have been found to be between 0.02 and 0.49 kg/day in weight (M. Howard and T. Nakatsubo pers. comm. in Pope <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) and on average 0.1 cm/day TL (Nakatsubo and Hirose 2007).<br/><br/>Longevity is estimated at between 20 and 23 years old; using a maximum age based estimator with low prediction error (M = 4.899t<sup>−0.916</sup>: Then and Hoenig 2014), the estimated adult natural mortality rate is 0.28-0.32. Age at first maturity is unknown, but inferred to be between 5 and 7 years (based on the smallest reported ripe female of 137 cm and assuming a linear growth rate to 3 m at 22 years old). Using the estimator for generation length of 1/adult mortality + age at first reproduction results in a generation length of 8-10 years, and thus a time window for calculating population declines of 24-30 years.","Ocean sunfish populations may be vulnerable to fishing activity because of the high levels of bycatch observed in many fisheries, including&#160;long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls&#160;(Silvani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Fulling <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Petersen and McDonell 2007).&#160;In South Africa, mid-water trawl fishery of the Cape horse mackerel&#160; (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Trachurus trachurus capensis</span>)  caught predominantly large individuals and observed a significant  decline in ocean sunfish catch rates between 2000 to 2003, with other  bycatch species remaining comparatively stable (Petersen and McDonell  2007). Bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest  ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch; far outnumbering the target  species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic.&#160;<em>Mola mola</em>  is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in a number of widely  distributed fisheries.","This species is a common resident of the offshore waters of the northwestern Atlantic during the spring and summer months, with an estimated summer abundance of 18,000 (Kenney 1996 in Potter <em>et al.</em> 2011). Large aggregations of small (&lt;1 m TL)&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> have been observed in coastal waters (Pope <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;Syväranta <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Irish and Celtic Seas, a total of 68&#160;were spotted from 2003-2005, or an overall density of 0.98 sunfish per 100 km²<sup></sup> (Houghton<em> et al.</em> 2006).&#160;According to reports from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Region, between 1990 and 1998, 26.1% of the drift net catch consisted of <em>M. mola</em>. This translates to a catch of more than 26,000 individuals (Rand Rasmussen, NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center, pers. comm. in Dewar <em>et al. </em>2010). Off the coast of South Africa, <em>M. mola</em>&#160;bycatch rates from the tuna and swordfish longline fishery are estimated at 340,000 sunfish annually (Petersen 2005, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Although estimates of population size are generally lacking, there is evidence of local population declines over short time scales.&#160;In Namibia,&#160;<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>showed a peak of catch landings in 2006 (40 metric tonnes), then decreased with only 7 metric tonnes in 2007 (FAO 2014); while CPUE was not available, this represents a decline of 82.5%. Landings have recently been reported from Argentina and are likely to increase (FAO 2014). In Ireland, there was been a decline of about 100% (13 to 0 metric tonnes) in 2 years (2000-2002). There was also a decline in Portugal from 12 metric tonnes in 1999 to about 0 in 2009 (FAO 2014).<br/><br/>Based on localized declines that exceed 80% and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over 3 generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is circumglobally distributed throughout warm and temperate zones of all oceans. In the eastern Pacific it is known from Canada (British Columbia), south to Peru and Chile (Chirichigno 1974,&#160;Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1983). In the Indo-Pacific it is known throughout the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, from Russia and Japan to Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands (Muus 1964, Smith 1965, Ayling and Cox 1982, Sims and Southall 2002, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Houghton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Konow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Todd and Grove 2010).&#160;It is considered a waif in the Persian Gulf.&#160;In the eastern Atlantic it is known from Scandinavia to South Africa (and occasionally in the western Baltic, North,&#160;and Mediterranean Seas). In the western Atlantic it is known from Canada (Newfoundland) south to Argentina including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea (Robins and Ray 1986,&#160;Figueiredo and Menezes 2000).&#160;Its depth range is 0-400 m (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).","<em>Mola mola</em> is not a commercially important fish (Fulling&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Silvani&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999), although there is some market for it in Japan (Sagara and Ozawa 2002, Watanabe and Sato 2008) and Taiwan (20.8-49.4 tonnes per annum, Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic. This species<em>&#160;</em>is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in long line, drift gillnet and midwater trawl&#160;fisheries. For example, the South African longline fishery for tuna and swordfish was estimated to have annually caught between 0.08 and 0.29 sunfish for every 1,000 hooks set (1.6-2.7 million hooks per year) in the 4 years between 2000 and 2003 (Petersen 2005). Furthermore,&#160;it&#160;was by far the most common bycatch species in the Cape horse mackerel (<em>Trachurus trachurus capensis</em>) midwater trawl fishery in the same region (Petersen and McDonell 2007), representing 51% of the total bycatch between 2002 and 2005 (Petersen and McDonell 2007). Similarly,&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;comprised between 70 and 93% of the total fish catch in Spanish drift gillnet fisheries within the Mediterranean between 1992 and 1994 (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999); bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch, far outnumbering the target species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). A crude calculation using values from a recent study of the Moroccan fleet (Tudela&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) suggests an annual bycatch of 36,450 ocean sunfish. Whilst the majority of&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;are returned to the water alive (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999), they often show varying levels of trauma (Cartamil and Lowe 2004) and post-catch survival data are lacking.&#160;<br/>There is little or no fishing effort likely to affect this species in the Gulf of Mexico (H.

It experiences excessive and increasing fishing pressure in most of its range, with indications of overexploitation in some areas. In South Africa, fishing mortality reduced spawning biomass per recruit to ~25% of the unexploited level in the mid-1990s. Commercial fishing effort was reduced substantially in 2003, but there has been no indication of improved catch per unit effort (CPUE) in aggregated grouper catches. Spawning biomass per recruit data indicate that the species is overexploited in southern Mozambique, and the mean size of captured fish has declined. In Mozambique, fishing effort is substantially higher now than in the mid-1990s, and is at higher than recommended levels for the semi-industrial line fishery, which is likely to expand to northern Mozambique as overall catch rates decline further south. The species is relatively well-protected in marine protected areas (soon to be increased) in South Africa, and to some extent in Mozambique. There have been some efforts to reduce commercial fishing effort, and bag limits are set for the recreational sector; however, non-compliance is occurring at some level.

Low numbers of this species are captured in the recreational ski-boat hook and line catches on the east coast of South Africa (Dunlop and Mann 2013). The only South African continuous long-term catch data available for this species is from largely unverified compulsory commercial catch records submitted by skippers to the national fisheries department. Aggregated serranid catch per unit effort remained at a low, but stable level from 1987-2013 (H. Winker unpub. data). According to an analysis of spawner biomass per recruit (SPBR) data from the mid-1990s, this species was assessed as overexploited (~25% of pristine SBPR; Fennessy 2000). The sex ratio in KwaZulu-Natal was heavily female biased during the 1990s, but it is not clear whether this resulted from fishing pressure or because of its natural rarity in this region. In Mozambique, where fishing effort was light at that time (mid-1990s), the sex ratio was less biased (Fennessy 2000). Fishing effort in the South African commercial skiboat fishery was reduced in 2003 following government withdrawal of <em>ca</em> 50% of fishing permits.<br/><br/><strong>Mozambique</strong>: In Mozambique, this species comprises the highest contribution to commercial grouper catches. A short survey conducted in 1999 reported that this species contributed substantially, about 21%, to small-scale hand-line fishing catches off Ilha de Mozambique, northern Mozambique (Institute of Marine Fisheries 1999). In the central Sofala Bank region, the species contributed 4% to overall catch by weight in 2007-2010, and less than 3% in 2011-2014 (R. Mutombene unpub. data). In southern Mozambique, it comprised between 1-5% by number and 2-15% by weight of overall catch in the semi-industrial linefishery from 2002 to 2014. Catch per unit effort declined by 79% over a six-year period; from about 33 kg/boat/day in 2008 to about 7 kg/boat/day in 2014 (R. Mutombene unpub. data). Catch has generally been variable since the fishery began in the mid-1990s (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2003), however, prior to 2002, the relative contribution of groupers to the catch is uncertain due to sampling biases (Oceanographic Research Institute unpub. data). The stock was reported to be overexploited in 2015, with a spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) level of less than 40% of pristine biomass (R. Mutombene unpub. data), but there is some uncertainty associated with the input parameters to the SBPR model. Mean total length of individuals in the catch declined from <em>ca</em> 64 cm in 2009 to <em>ca</em> 58 cm in 2014. There is excessive commercial fishing effort in southern Mozambique that has been expanding into northern Mozambique. <span style=""""><br/></span>",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the western Indian Ocean from the east coast of South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces to 33°S) to northern Mozambique between 13° to 15°30'S (Smith 1957, Anon. 1999, Mutombene <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reported range is from 24°50'S to 33°S (Heemstra and Randall 1993).&#160;A single photographic record from southwest India is likely a misidentification (R. Nair and E. Heemstra pers. comm. 2016). Its depth range is 25 to 120 metres. The area within the generalized distribution polygon clipped to the 25 to 100 metre isobath, which is the best estimate of area of occupancy (AOO),&#160;is 30,975 km² (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). The area within the minimum convex polygon drawn around the boundaries of its previously mentioned AOO, which is the best estimate of extent of occurrence (EOO), is 590,262 km² (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). This species is closely reef-associated, and the AOO calculation is therefore an overestimate, but currently no spatial data are available to be able to calculate a total area of coral and rocky reef habitat in this region.</p>",This species is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers and sold in local markets as well as exported to Europe. Its national commercial value is about USD 7-8 per kg. This species was also taken as bycatch in the Mozambique experimental industrial trap fishery from 1997 to 2001 (Torres<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011).,Marine,"This species occurs in several large, well-enforced marine protected areas (MPAs) in South Africa and in the adjacent Ponta do Ouro Partial MPA of southern Mozambique; the total area of these MPAs is ~1,400 km². It likely is also protected in the Primeiras and Segundas MPA and the Quirimbas MPA in northern Mozambique. In South Africa, there is a minimum size limit of 40 cm total length and a recreational bag limit of five fish per person per day (within that category of fish). Commercial fishing effort in the South African ski-boat fishery&#160;was substantially reduced in 2003 upon the withdrawal of <em>ca</em> 50% of fishing permits. Additional MPAs in the range of this species in South Africa are to be promulgated shortly (as of 2018). Previously, there was fairly good compliance with bag and size limitation&#160;regulations owing to an active conservation agency in KwaZulu-Natal; however, as of July 2016, adherence to compliance measures has been considerably reduced with the removal of the agency’s mandate by the national department of fisheries. A general recreational bag limit of four serranid fish applies in Mozambique, but is seldom enforced.","",,false,false,Global
100466495,14051,Mycteroperca olfax,Vulnerable,A2bd,2018,2016-12-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Mycteroperca olfax</em> has a relatively small range in three remote, offshore island localities in the eastern tropical Pacific. The majority of its population occurs in the Galapagos where fishing is allowed in some areas. Smaller subpopulations occur at Cocos Island and Malpelo Island which are no-take areas. The species has been targeted by fishers since at least the late 1920s. Historical landings and scientific survey data indicate that overexploitation has been occurring since at least 1983 and continues to occur. Based on landings data and levels of exploitation, it is inferred that the population has declined by at least 30% over the past 40.5 years (three generation time window). Despite some positive actions to eliminate fishing effort within the Galapagos Marine Reserve, fishing remains a major ongoing threat to the population due to the lack of effective fishery management. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable A2bd.","<p><em>Mycteroperca olfax</em> is found among rock walls, rocky reef drop-offs, underwater lava ridges and other well-structured vertical rock formations (Reck 1983, Garrison 2005). Juveniles are found in shallow sandy lagoons, seagrass beds, mangrove lagoons, shallow lava reefs and inland lava ponds (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Adults are mainly piscivorous, and large adults feed primarily on Pacific Creolefish,&#160;<em>Cephalopholis colonus</em>&#160;(Reck 1983, Grove and Lavenberg 1997). Its maximum total length is 120 cm (Robertson and Allen 2015).<br/> <br/>According to Coello and Grimm (1993), first sexual maturation occurs at a length of 47.5 cm and four years of age. Sex transition occurs around 83.7 cm and approximately 12 years. Usseglio <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated an average length and age at first sexual maturity in females of 65.3 cm total length and six and a half years. Using an estimate of age at first maturity of 6.5 years, and a maximum observed age of 21 years (Usseglio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) Usseglio&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated the generational turnover time as 13.7 years.&#160;The species is likely a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite due to the lack of males in smaller size classes and severely skewed sex ratios (48-67 females per male). However, a deficiency in histological evidence means that the sexual pattern is not yet resolved (Coello and Grimm 1993, Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Coello and Grimm (1993) identified two individuals as transitionals through gross examination of gonads and the presence of cyst-like structures thought to have originated from degenerating oocytes. Subsequent histological examinations identified the presence of spermatogenic crypts but no evidence of of testicular proliferation. These descriptions are consistent with the characterization of bisexual (non-functional) females, a trait that has been reported in both protogynous and gonochoric species of <em>Mycteropera</em> (e.g.,&#160;<em>M. microlepis and</em>&#160;<em>M. rosacea</em>). In the Galápagos, <em>M. olfax</em> has been reported to spawn from October to January with peaks in October and December (Coello and Grimm 1993), December to April (Rodríguez 1984), and October through March or April with a October-January peak (Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2015, Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2016). A spawning aggregation of approximately 40 to 60 individuals was first documented&#160;at one site within the Galápagos Marine Reserve according to Salinas de Leon <em>et al. </em>(2015).<br/><br/>Studies have reported on the heavily sex ratios in this species' population being skewed towards females, which means that males are typically rarely collected (Coello and Grimm 1993, Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is evidence that skewed sex ratios observed in fisheries catches and scientific surveys is at least in part due to complex social behaviours that are similar to the Gag Grouper (<em>M. microlepis</em>)<em>,</em>&#160;wherein males and females are sexually segregated during the non-spawning season, with males occupying offshore banks and females occupying coastal, inshore reefs. Coello and Grimm (1993) also noted that males were not always associated with females, males were often collected at locations where no females were detected and fishers observed that the largest fish (presumably males) were more commonly caught on offshore banks.</p>","Exploitation is the main major threat to this species, and is amplified by its small range with low connectivity between subpopulations and by biological characteristics which cause it to be intrinsically susceptible to overfishing, including slow growth, late maturity and reproductive strategies of protogynous hermaphroditism and aggregate spawning. In addition, predictive ecosystem models indicate that the loss of&#160;<em>M. olfax</em> can trigger&#160;serious changes to the community structure of lower trophic levels in the Galápagos Marine Reserve&#160;(Ruttenberg 2001, Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2016).","<p>Based on underwater survey and historical catch data from the Galapagos, which is the main source of its fragmented population, this species has experienced global-level population declines due to continuing overexploitation of at least 30% over the past three generation lengths (40.5 years; 1976-2016).<br/><br/><strong>Fishery-Independent Data:&#160;</strong>Between May 2000 and December 2001, Edgar <em>et al</em>. (2004) performed spatially comprehensive&#160;underwater visual censuses across the Galápagos and estimated the density of <em>Mycteroperca olfax</em>&#160;as ranging from 0.06 fish/500 m² in the northern region to 13.6 fish/500 m² in the western region. The density for all sites combined was 3.92 fish/500 m². According to a visual census conducted by Ruttenberg (2001) in the Galápagos between June and August 1998, the estimated biomass of <em>M. olfax</em>&#160;was much higher in lightly fished areas of Santa Cruz Island (2,959 ±413/±1SE g/150 m²) than in heavily fished areas (133 ±79.6 g/150 m²). The density showed the same trend with 0.76 (±0.096) fish/150 m² in lightly fished areas and 0.06 (±0.042) fish/150 m² in heavily fished areas (Ruttenberg 2001). However, these densities may have been influenced by the very strong El Niño event that occurred in 1998 (Nicolaides <em>et al.</em> 2001). Data from these fishery independent surveys support that <em>M</em><em>. olfax</em>&#160;is widespread across the entire Galapagos, its population density varies by location and heavy fishing pressure appears to cause heavy localized declines. Based on the localities studied in Ruttenberg (2001), a 68% difference in biomass and 92% decline in density was apparent in fished versus unfished sites.<br/><br/><strong>Fishery-Dependent Data:&#160;</strong>In the 1940s,&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;was the most valuable finfish targeted by the Galápagos artisanal fishery, where it comprised nearly 100% of the total finfish catch (Reck 1983).&#160;Landings of&#160;<em>M. olfax&#160;</em>in&#160;Galápagos finfish&#160;fisheries began to significantly decline around 1998 (Schiller <em>et al.</em> 2013). In 2000,&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;declined from comprising 30% to 11% of the total Galápagos fishery catch (Guime 2003). It also declined to approximately 5% of the total annual Galápagos catch by value (Nicolaides&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Edgar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Currently, it comprises less than 17% of the finfish catch, and several studies indicate that catch volumes, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and average individual size have declined ( Reck 1983, Nicolaides <em>et al.</em> 2002, Burbano<em> et al.</em> 2014, Schiller <em>et al</em>. 2013)&#160;According to Nicolaides&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2002), the CPUE of&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;in the Galápagos from 1977 to 2001 ranged from nine to 20.1 kg/fisherman/day and size range data for landed fish available for the years 1977, 1998, 1999 and 2001 showed no clear trends. Nicolaides&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2002) concluded that the decline in&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;landings reflected a decline in targeted effort for this species as the fishery shifted to more profitable species such as sea cucumber and lobster, especially between the years 1988 to 1990. Usseglio <em>et al. </em>(2016) estimated the ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality (F/M) as 1.98 ±0.2 SD, and when compared to the reference point of F<sub>MSY</sub>&#160;= 0.87 M; this indicates that fishing mortality is very high and is not sustainable. <br/><br/>In addition, the expansion of the fishery into the outer islands in recent years in order to exploit other populations may be masking the true magnitude of the rate of decline (Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2015). For example, a 2012&#160;survey of the handline finfish fishery reported that <em>M. olfax </em>comprised up to 40% of the landed biomass (Zimmerhackel <em>et al</em>. 2015). Interviews with fishers indicate that the size of landed&#160;fish also declined over time, which supports further&#160;evidence of overfishing (Burbano&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Furthermore, the proportion of juveniles in the catch increased from 35% in the 1970s (Coello and Grimm 1993) to about 73% in recent years (at Santa Cruz, Santiago, Isabela, and Wolf Islands via Usseglio<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015). Adding to this, the majority (95.7%) of&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;currently landed in the Galápagos&#160;commercial finfish handline fishery are below the average length at first sexual maturity, the number of fish within the optimal length interval is very low (4.7%) and almost no mega-spawners (0.2%) are landed (Usseglio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Studies have also found heavily skewed sex ratios towards females (48:1 via Coello and Grimm 1993 and 67:1 via Usseglio <em>et al. </em>2015), which is attributed to targeted fishing effort for large males, but is also suspected to be influenced by seasonal differences in social behaviour between the sexes (Coello and Grimm 1993). Since this is presumably a protogynous species, these skewed sex ratios indicate that the potential&#160;reproductive success of&#160;the Galápagos population is greatly reduced. Moreover, the spawning potential ratio is currently 5% of the unfished population. Fishing parameter estimates indicate that overfishing occurred throughout the 30-year time period of 1983 to 2012. Over this same period, approximately 80% of the fish landed were immature, the mean total length of landed fish steadily decreased by 8 cm (55 cm to 47 cm) and the largest individuals decreased in length from 115 cm to 79 cm based on comparisons of historical photographs dating back to the 1930s. Currently, individuals fully recruit to the fishery at 15 cm below the average size at first sexual maturity. These data indicate that both recruitment and growth overfishing are occurring and have been occurring for at least the past three decades, and the stock is in danger of collapse due to reproductive failure (Usseglio <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The small subpopulations at Cocos Island and Malpelo Island are protected, and abundance&#160;has remained steady according to studies conducted from 2003 to 2011 (Soler<em> et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"This eastern tropical Pacific species occurs in only three remote insular localities: the Galápagos Islands Archipelago (Ecuador), Cocos Island (Costa Rica) and Malpelo Island (Colómbia) (McCosker and Rosenblatt 1975, Grove and Lavenberg 1997, Garrison 2005, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robertson and Allen 2015). Sporadic occurrences have been reported in coastal Costa Rica to Peru, but these are considered vagrants (e.g., Béarez and Jiménez-Prado 2003) or mis-identifications.

This fishery has targeted&#160;<em>Mycteroperca olfax </em>since&#160;the late 1920s, when Norwegians introduced the butterfly method of salting and drying fish that gives bacalao (known as cod in Spanish) its name (Reck 1983). It is exported to the Ecuadorean&#160;mainland in its dried form and utilized in a traditional dish called “fanesca”, which is primarily consumed during the Easter holiday (Marconi <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fundación AZTI 2003, Nicolaides <em>et al.</em> 2002, Zimmerhackel <em>et al</em>. 2015). The fishery operates year-round, with peaks during October through April to meet elevated commercial demand for fanesca season (Reck 1983, Nicolaides<em> et al</em>. 2002). In order to meet demand, spawning aggregations are specifically targeted by commercial handline fisheries from December through April. Targeted effort for&#160;<em>M. olfax</em>&#160;has reportedly dwindled in the commercial fisheries largely due to a switch to the high market value that lobster and sea cucumber now receive (Hearn 2008). The species is also targeted by the tourism-based recreational fishery, which has grown in recent decades (Schiller <em>et al.</em> 2014) and is also caught illegally by spearfishermen (Usseglio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;</p>",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific fisheries management regulations or conservation measures in place for&#160;<em>Mycteroperca olfax&#160;</em>in the Galápagos (Usseglio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The species&#160;occurs within the Galápagos Marine Reserve and at least one spawning aggregation event has been recorded within its boundaries (Salinas de Leon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Banks<em> et al.</em> (2012) reported that the biomass of <em>M. olfax</em> increased within no-take zones of the Galápagos Marine Reserve. The small subpopulations of <em>M. olfax </em>at Cocos Island and Malpelo Island are protected from fishing as both areas are no-take zones. Abundance has remained steady according to a study conducted from 2003 to 2011 (Soler <em>et al. </em>2013), but improved management and enforcement are needed in both areas as their remote locations hinder current efforts.&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global
100467602,7859,Epinephelus marginatus,Vulnerable,A2bd+4bd,2018,2016-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Epinephelus marginatus</em> is a widely distributed species that inhabits rocky reef habitat. Its global population is comprised of at least four mostly separated subpopulations. It has been heavily targeted by recreational and commercial fishers, especially in the European/Mediterranean portion of its range, for hundreds of years. As a result, its population is known to be greatly reduced in certain areas, and immature individuals are now increasingly also taken. Landings data for this species are reported annually to FAO by some countries, particularly southern Europe and the Mediterranean and parts of northwestern Africa, but to a much lesser extent in southeastern Africa and southeastern South America. When aggregated on a global level, landings have declined by about 86% over the past 24 years (from 1992-2016). Reliable data are mostly limited in most of its four subpopulations, especially on trends in fishing effort, but it remains a highly-valued species throughout its range, and it is unlikely that fishing effort for it would have been voluntarily reduced. <br/><br/>The four subpopulations are summarized as follows:<ol><li><strong>Northeast Atlantic/Mediterranean: </strong>recorded declines in landings averaging 88% over the past generation length (estimated as 33.75 years); some recovery in abundance is occurring where fishing effort has been significantly reduced (e.g., northern Mediterranean);</li><li><strong>West Africa: </strong>lack of data makes status poorly understood, but grouper fisheries do exist in the region, so the potential for declines is possible;</li><li><strong>Southwestern Indian Ocean: </strong>apparently overexploited in South Africa at least in the late 1990s and status elsewhere in the region not well known;</li><li><strong>Southwestern Atlantic: </strong>significant declines in landings over the past 10 to 15 years across southern Brazil and status elsewhere in the region not well known. In addition, fishing is expected to continue, and has been recently increasing in some areas.</li></ol>This species also has a high intrinsic vulnerability to overfishing due to protogynous hermaphroditism, aggregate spawning behaviour and slow growth. There is evidence for some localised recovery in certain protected areas with no-take zones mainly in the Northeast Atlantic/Mediterranean portion of its range, including in French waters where a complete fishing ban for this species has been in place since at least 2003. Quantitative data are insufficient to estimate population trends over a three generation length period (about 101 years); however, considering that the majority of the global population of this species is within the Northeast Atlantic/Mediterranean subpopulation, which has experienced serious declines exceeding 80% over the past generation length and probably more, and given anecdotal reports of serious declines expected to continue into the future elsewhere in its range, we believe a precautionary approach that suspects a global-level decline of at least 30-50% over the next two generation lengths is appropriate. Considering the uncertainty in the data, it is conservatively listed as Vulnerable A2bd+4bd. Further research is needed on its population status, especially in the southwestern Indian Ocean, the southwestern Atlantic and West Africa, and actions that reduce fishing effort are greatly needed. The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species inhabits rocky substrate to about 300 metres depth, but occurs in higher abundance to 50 metres (Bruslé 1985, Heemstra and Randall 1993, Reiner 1996, Harmelin and Harmelin-Vivien 1999, Louisy 2005, Andrello <em>et al</em>. 2013). Post-metamorphic juveniles can be very common (and even abundant) in tide pools during the first two weeks of September in the Azores (J.P. Barreiros and P. Afonso unpub. data). It has a relatively small home range and high site fidelity (Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2013, Oceanographic Research Institute unpublished data). It primarily feeds on fishes, crustaceans (mainly crabs and lobsters) and cephalopods (mainly octopus) (Smale 1986). This species forms small spawning aggregations of a few tens of individuals (Zabala <em>et al</em>. 1997a, b). In European waters, aggregation sites have been observed in the Mediterranean Sea in the Medes Islands Marine Reserve, Spain (Zabala <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Hereu <em>et al</em>. 2006), off Lampedusa Island, Italy (Marino <em>et al</em>. 2001), in the National Park of Port-Cros, France (Chauvet and Francour 1990) and in the Bouches de Bonifacio Marine Reserve, Corsica, France (J.M. Culioli pers. comm. 2016); and in the Atlantic Ocean at the Azores Islands (Barreiros 1998, Barreiros and Santos 1998) and probably elsewhere in the Macaronesian islands and southern mainland Portugal. In the northwestern Mediterranean, peak spawning occurs in July and August (Hereu <em>et al</em>. 2006, Reñones <em>et al</em>. 2010) and in December in Brazil (Andrade <em>et al</em>. 2003). Aggregation sites also likely exist in Brazil as spearfishermen have reported large catches (of up to 400 kg) being taken within a few days from the same areas (Andrade <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>This is a monandric protogynous hermaphroditic species, that transitions from female to male with growth. Females in Tunisian waters reach sexual maturity at age five, and transitioned to males between nine and sixteen years of age (Chauvet 1988). In the Balearic Islands, females reach sexual maturity at 49 cm total length and six years, and sex reversal can be notably delayed (Reñones <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Brazil, 50% of females reached sexual maturity at 49 cm, the overall largest female was 79 cm and the smallest male was 80 cm. In Spain, the maximum reported age was 52 years for females and 61 years for males (Reñones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Based on a longevity of 61 years, age of first maturity of 6.5 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 33.75 years.","Overexploitation is a major threat to this species. The slow growth rate, protogynous hermaphroditism and spawning aggregation behaviour of this species causes it to be particularly susceptible to rapid population decline upon high fishing pressure (Fennessy 1998, 2000).","This species occurs in at least four main separate/disjunct populations with minimal gene flow between them: the northeastern Atlantic/Mediterranean, the southeastern Atlantic/West Africa, the southwestern Indian Ocean and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Schunter <em>et al</em>. 2011). Population information is available from some areas in its range from fishery landings and underwater surveys. In shallower areas, underwater surveying is probably the most effective method for population estimation. In the Mediterranean Sea, which is one of the main centres of its global population, landings data indicate a serious and continuing decline. Some populations of this species (e.g., in Macaronesia and probably also parts of southern Brazil) have apparently experienced a lesser impact from fishing pressure than the Mediterranean and southern Europe population; however, these areas are likely to represent a relatively small proportion of the overall global population in comparison to the Mediterranean and northwestern Africa. There is a lack of adequate catch/population information from some of its relatively wide distribution (e.g., South Africa, and parts of Brazil) which could be used to determine any significant population trends in these areas. Populations around some of the Macaronesian islands, and particularly the Azores (J.P. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016), although relatively small, are considered to be relatively healthy compared with those found in mainland southern European and Mediterranean waters, but may also be declining (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>According to total global landings reported to FAO from 1950 to the mid 2010s (mostly only reported at the species level by European/Mediterranean countries), catch was about 200 metric tons in 1950 and gradually increased over the subsequent 23 years to a peak of about 6,000 metric tons in 1973 (FishStatJ database accessed 2015; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Between 1975 and 1983, annual landings declined to between 1,000 to 2,000 metric tons and then rapidly increased to peak at about 8,000 metric tons in 1992. These landings were primarily attributed to developing fisheries in the Mediterranean. From 1993 onwards, global landings declined very rapidly to about 1,000 metric tons in 2015 and are expected to have since remained at that level. This represents an estimated decline of 86% over the past 24 years (1992-2016), a period equivalent to about one generation length, and these declines are considered to be ongoing. In addition, there was an estimated decline of ~88% over 10 years for southern Europe and the Mediterranean prior to 2001; and an even greater decline of ~94% over 20 years using decadal averages for southern Europe for the period between 1984 and 2013. Quantitative data are lacking in two out of the four subpopulations, but based on knowledge that grouper fisheries are in significant decline in those areas, it is suspected that at least a 30-50% decline in its global-level population has occurred over the past generation length (about 34 years; 1982-2016) and is expected to continue into the future over the next two generation lengths, which is a time period that extends to about 2083 (a total of 101 years).&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean:</strong> According to archaeological sites in Spain, Tunisia, Corsica, Cyprus, Sicily and Italy, this species was very abundant in the coastal systems between the 35th and 40th parallels, accounting for 30-80% of the examined bony remains until the end of the Mesolithic and during the Neolithic eras (Desse and Desse-Berset 1999). A survey of ancient Greek, Etruscan and Roman mosaics and paintings reported the depiction of large groupers being caught near the water’s surface by fishermen using poles or harpoons from boats, techniques that would yield no grouper catch today, which also supports the implication that abundance in coastal waters was high in the distant past (Guidetti and Micheli 2011). In the northern Mediterranean, this species had not been reproductively active until relatively recently, probably due to an unbalanced sex-ratio (i.e., lack of males) caused by fishing (Bodilis <em>et al</em>. 2003), but has also traditionally been more naturally abundant in the southern Mediterranean (Echwikhi <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, increases in density, recruitment and reproductive populations/spawning aggregations have been observed in the northwestern Mediterranean since about 2010 (P. Lenfant and P. Francour pers. comm. 2016) due to an effective fishing moratorium along the French Mediterranean coast. Individuals reported from the northeastern Atlantic at latitudes above ~45 degrees north are generally large and probably correspond to non-reproducing vagrants. In most of Spain and Italy, this species is relatively abundant only in marine protected areas (MPAs) where fishing is totally prohibited (La Mesa and Vacchi 1999, Guidetti <em>et al</em>. 2014, Barreiros 2015). There is evidence from underwater surveys that this species may be undergoing recovery in several Mediterranean marine protected areas where fishing is either restricted or banned (Vacchi <em>et al</em>. 1998, Harmelin-Vivien <em>et al</em>. 2008, Di Franco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2012, Villamor and Becerro 2012, Garcia-Rubies <em>et al</em>. 2013, Harmelin 2013, Guidetti <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>According to FAO landings statistics, catch declined over the past 20 years in Italy by 98%, in Turkey by 78%, in Libya by 83%, in Greece by 28%, in Spain by 59% and in Portugal by 93% (FishStatJ database accessed 2015; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). The targeted fishery for this species in Turkey and Libya developed and peaked later than the fishery in Italy. The fishery in Spain and Portugal peaked earlier than that in Italy. A decline has also more recently been observed in Tunisia and southern Spain due to overfishing (Francour and Gratiot 2007); but no further details are available. Catches from Libya currently comprise the majority of catch from the Mediterranean Sea, and around half of the current global catch of this species. In the Azores archipelago, total catch fluctuated between 1978 and 2015, and generally declined after 2000 (Santos 2015).<br/><br/><strong>West Africa: </strong>According to FAO landings statistics, Mauritania has reported four years of catch (from 2010 to 2013), that averaged ~66 metric tons per year. From 2003 to 2013, annual catch reported by Senegal averaged ~123 metric tons, with no particular trend over time. Anecdotal reports claim large commercial catches of this species were exported from southern Angola in the 1990s (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2016). In 2008, it comprised 2% of the artisanal catch in Namibe and Tombua, Angola (W. Potts pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Western Indian Ocean: </strong>This species is occasionally caught south to Knysna, South Africa (34°S, 23°E), whereafter (i.e., westwards of there) it is increasingly uncommon. Specimens found to the south of 31°S are reproductively inactive, and much smaller than those found further to the north along the east coast of southern Africa (Fennessy 2006). Based on data collected in 1995-1997, spawning biomass per recruit in the South African population had been reduced to ~30% of pristine levels and was considered overexploited (Fennessy 2000). The only South African long-term data of grouper catch trends is from largely unverified compulsory commercial catch records submitted by fishing boat skippers to the national fisheries department, and these data were aggregated for all serranids (though four species, including this one, were predominant in the catch). A substantial reduction in commercial fishing effort occurred in 2003 as well as a reduction in the recreational bag limit and an increase in the minimum size limit to 60 cm. Evidence of any recovery following these interventions was, however, not clear. Two surveys conducted in the 1990s and 2000s recorded that this species comprised a relatively low portion of catches in eastern South Africa. In southern Mozambique between 2002 and 2014, catch per unit effort of this species in the semi-industrial line fishery varied between 0.5 and 8.7 kg/boat/per day, with no significant trends over time. However, this fishery had commenced in earnest by the mid-1990s, and the contribution of this species to the overall catch is suspected to have declined since then (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2016; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/><strong>Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: </strong>This species is targeted by artisanal fisheries and spearfishers from Espírito Santo to Santa Catarina in southern Brazil (Andrade <em>et al</em>. 2003). It is also targeted by bottom long-line fleets from Espirito Santo to Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. No useful longer-term catch data are available from this subpopulation, except for the Santa Catarina region of southern Brazil (Figures 4 and 5 in the Supplementary Information). The Santa Catarina fishery developed over a ten-year period from around 1988 (~25 metric tons) to 1998 (~75 metric tons), after which catches declined by almost 99% to only ~1 metric tons by 2012 (about 15 years). The fishery in Sao Paulo is smaller, and showed no particular trend, fluctuating between ~5 and ~25 metric tons between 1998 and 2015. In Rio de Janeiro, catch data are only available from 2011 to 2014, during which total annual catch declined from ~9.2 to ~6.4 metric tons. Catch per unit effort also declined from about 75 to 20 kg/trip between 2011 and 2014.",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from the southern English Channel, south along the coasts of western Spain and Portugal, throughout the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesian islands and south along West Africa to southern Angola and possibly northern Namibia at the Cunene River (H. Holtzhausen pers. comm. 2016). It also occurs in the Western Indian Ocean from western South Africa (C. Attwood pers. comm. 2016) to southern Mozambique, southeastern Madagascar (25°S, 47°E; P. Heemstra unpub. data, S. Fennessy pers. obs. 2013) and Reunion Island (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, it is distributed from the mouth of the Rio Doce in the state of Espírito Santo in Brazil south to northern Patagonia in Argentina (Irigoyen <em>et al</em>. 2005, M. Borgonha pers. comm. 2016, Condini <em>et al</em>. 2016). Its depth range is zero to 300 metres.<br/><br/>In the past it has been recorded from the Sea of Marmara within the Mediterranean (Devedjian 1915 in Bilecenoglu <em>et al</em>. 2002), but hasn't been recorded there since, and is absent from the Black Sea (Keskin 2010, M. Bilecenoglu pers. comm. 2016). In the northeastern Atlantic, there are few records north of ~45°N latitude, the northern-most being from the French coastline in the English Channel (49°21.5’N, 0°35’W; Mahé <em>et al</em>. 2012). In West Africa, it may be absent from parts of the Gulf of Guinea, but this still requires confirmation (J.P. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). Records from southern Oman (Randall 1995) are probably waifs or misidentifications.","This emblematic species is targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries, especially in the Mediterranean Sea and southeastern Africa. It is also caught by small-scale/artisanal fishers in Brazil, Mozambique and Madagascar (P. Heemstra unpublished data, S. Fennessy pers. obs. 2013). It is generally caught using long-lines, hand-lines or spear. This species also supports dive ecotourism (Briquet-Laugier <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>There have been some efforts to develop aquaculture for this species to fill market need left by depleted wild populations as well as mass production of juveniles to possibly restock wild populations in the Mediterranean, Portugal and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Bruzon 2007, Pierre <em>et al</em>. 2007, Marino <em>et al</em>. 2007, J.P. Barreiros and A. Bertoncini pers. comm. 2016).<br/><p></p>",Marine,"<strong>Northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean: </strong>A spearfishing ban has been imposed on this species in France, Monaco, the Azores and Madeira. In France, the first moratorium from 1993 to 1998 prohibited only spearfishing, but in 2003, it was extended to include angling by both artisanal and professional fishermen, and is now expected to remain until at least 2023. Increasing abundance in French marine protected areas (MPAs) is believed to be related to several factors: increased numbers of MPAs and connectivity between them, spearfishing bans and warming of the Mediterranean Sea (Harmelin 2013). The removal of legal protections for this species (i.e., a resumption of spearfishing and linefishing) would impact the re-established juvenile populations that now exist in this area (Bodilis <em>et al</em>. 2003). Banning spearfishing while allowing linefishing may offer little protection for this and other similar large grouper species (J.P. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). At the international level, <em>E. marginatus</em> is listed in Annex III of the Barcelona Convention (species for which their exploitation is regulated). This species is also recorded in Annexe III of the Bern Convention, but only for the Mediterranean Sea. A number of MPAs have also been established which protect both the populations and habitats of this species throughout various parts of the Mediterranean Sea and Macaronesia (EUNIS 2014). Renones <em>et al</em>. (2010) recommends implementing a “slot” size limit for this species in Spain to allow only capture of individuals between 50 and 80 cm total length (i.e., only females) and to establish MPAs with no-take zones.<br/><strong>Southwestern Atlantic Ocean: </strong>In Brazil, there is a minimum catch size of 47 cm for all fisheries that capture this species, and it occurs in many MPAs. Monitoring of artisanal/recreational fisheries landings are insufficient in Brazil.<br/><br/><strong>Western Indian Ocean:</strong> In South Africa, there is a bag limit of one fish per person per day and a minimum size limit of 60 cm total length for all fisheries. It occurs in several MPAs in South Africa and southern Mozambique.<br/><br/><strong>West Africa:</strong> There are no species-specific conservation measures in the West African region. <br/><br/>Tidepools are an important habitat for juveniles, and thus, protections within MPA networks are needed (Barreiros <em>et al</em>. 2004, Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further genetic research on the populations of this species is needed (Schunter <em>et al</em>. 2011).","",,false,false,Global

Spawning aggregations are heavily exploited by fisheries throughout its range, and it is exported from several countries to supply the live reef fish food and chilled fish trade. Due to overfishing, at least 42% of the 55 known aggregations have either declined in abundance or been extirpated over the past three decades. Fisheries catch data also provide supporting evidence that significant population declines have occurred in the Philippines, Indonesia, Micronesia, Palau, the Maldives and Fiji. Overfishing is likely occurring elsewhere in its range where large-scale grouper fisheries are present. There are conservation measures in place to protect spawning aggregations in many localities, but enforcement is considered insufficient to prevent poaching in most areas except Australia and Chagos. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the 1970s, which covers a period of mostly two generations in length (about 50 years), and this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next generation length (about 25 years). It is listed as Vulnerable A2bd+4bd. Improvements in fisheries monitoring and management are needed and spawning aggregation sites should be a high priority for conservation.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.</p>","Adults of this species inhabit lagoon pinnacles, patch reefs, channels and outer reef slopes in clearwater, coral-rich areas. Juveniles inhabit seagrass beds and estuarine or low salinity inshore areas. Its maximum total length is 120 cm. It utilizes migratory corridors to reach spawning aggregation sites (a travel distance of up to 25 km), and males tend to arrive prior to females. Spawning aggregations&#160;are typically formed in channels, patch reefs and outer reef pinnacles at depths from 3 to greater than 70 m in areas ranging in size from 16 to 175 km² (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2012, Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2013, Waldie<em> et al. </em>2016). Aggregations tend to form consistently relative to specific lunar cycles (several each year), with individuals resident at the site for up to 14 days (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Rhodes<em> et al.</em> 2012).&#160;Spawning aggregation sites are known from the Seychelles&#160;(Bijoux <em>et al.</em> 2013), British Indian Ocean Territory, Kenya, Palau (Western Channel, Ebiil and Ulong), Pohnpei (Micronesia), Melanesia (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia), Komodo National Park (Indonesia), Dumbea (New Caledonia) and Fiji.<br/><br/>In Australia, the size at 50% sexual maturity for females is 57 cm fork length and about 9 years of age, with a maximum reported age of 42 years (Pears <em>et al.</em> 2006, Mapleston<em> et al</em>. 2009). <span style="""">Based on a longevity of 42 years, age of first maturity of 9 years,&#160;</span>and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood&#160;(2006)<span style="""">, one generation length is estimated to be 25.5 years.</span>",Heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations and take of juveniles from wild stocks for aquaculture grow-out are major threats to this species. Secondary threats include the degradation of seagrass beds and coral reefs due to coastal development and climate change (Burke<em> et al.</em> 2002).,"This species is relatively uncommon and typically forms transient spawning aggregations during a few months of the year (Robinson<em> et al</em>. 2015). Outside of spawning season, this species is a minor component of fisheries catches. Significant population declines have occurred in areas where spawning aggregations have sustained heavy fishing pressure. Countries where aggregations have been fished to very low abundances include the following: Micronesia, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Maldives, Malaysia, Thailand, the Solomon Islands and Melanesia (including Palau and Fiji). A total of 55 aggregations have been documented for this species in the SCRFA database (<a href=""https://www.scrfa.org/database/"">https://www.scrfa.org/database/</a> accessed November 2016, Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2016). According to data collected during underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted over the past three decades,&#160;19 of these aggregations have an unknown status (34%), 21 are declining (38%), two are extirpated (4%), three are increasing (5%), and 11 have remained unchanged (20%).&#160;The live reef fish food trade began in the 1990s and the steepest population declines occurred shortly after. Populations remain healthy on the Great Barrier Reef and Chagos Archipelago due to well-managed protected areas and restricted fishing on aggregations, but populations elsewhere have experienced severe declines. Therefore, the global population decline since the 1970s and 1990s is suspected to be at least 30%, and possibly as high as 50%, and is expected to continue into the future.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Philippines: </strong>In<strong>&#160;</strong><span style="""">the Philippines, there is&#160;</span>anecdotal evidence that declines began shortly after the 1970s. According to<strong>&#160;</strong>national statistics in the Philippines, landings of this species were highly variable from 1999 to 2016, but have been declining sharply since 2013 (from 2,744 kg in 2013 to 140 kg in 2016; Santos and Barut<em> </em>2017; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material)<span style="""">.</span><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Hong Kong:</strong>&#160;Imports of this species by sea and air to Hong Kong for the live reef fish food trade increased from about 200 mt in 2000 to 1,400 mt in 2010 and declined thereafter to about 1,000 mt in 2016. An unknown percentage of these imports are sourced from hatchery-produced mariculture (mainly Taiwan, Indonesia and possibly China; Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al</em>. 2017; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In recent years, imports of this species have predominantly originated from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. Imports from Indonesia have declined notably since 2006, which could reflect declining populations there.<br/><strong><br/>Micronesia:<span style="""">&#160;</span></strong><span style="""">Throughout Micronesia, spawning aggregation sizes have declined by at least 80%. T</span>his species was occasionally&#160;observed during an underwater survey conducted in 2005 in Pohnpei (Allen 2005). Underwater surveys conducted from 2001-2013 at a large spawning aggregation site in the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary reported continuous density declines from a high of approximately 125 individuals per 1,000 m² in 2005 to less than 25 individuals in 2013, which represents an 80% decline over 8 years&#160;(Rhodes<em> et al</em>. 2014). Since 2005, aggregations at Kehpara have been fished and have declined continuously since that time. A market survey conducted in Pohnpei in 2005 identified 98 individuals of this species, which represented 3.3% of the total catch. These individuals ranged in total length from 21.6 to 67 cm with an average of 39 cm, and 25% of females and 92% of males were immature (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). During a follow-up market survey in 2015-2016, 98 individuals were identified as this species, which represented 3.3% of the total catch and ranked 8th among the observed grouper species. These individuals ranged in total length from 30-70 cm with an average of 45.9 cm and 46% were immature (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes&#160;unpub. data&#160;2016).&#160;A fishery survey conducted in Chuuk in 2014&#160;recorded that this species represented 0.8% of total landings, with 85% taken by spear and 15% by hook and line, the average total length was 55.4 cm with a range from 30 to 90 cm and about 45% were immature (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).<span style="""">&#160;There have been illegal activities reported in Chuuk of foreign vessels taking groupers for the live reef food fish trade for export, although there is no information on volumes (C. Graham pers. comm. 2016).</span><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Solomon Islands:</strong>&#160;An underwater survey conducted in 2006 in the Solomon Islands occasionally recorded this species at depths from 3 to 60 m.<strong>&#160;</strong>In the Solomon Islands, aggregations are known from Njari and Kennedy Islands and Munda (Roviana Lagoon) in Western Province, and others have been anecdotally reported from a wide number of localities (Hamilton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). At Njari, aggregation densities were up to 25 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2009-2011 (Hughes<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011). Little is known on the Kennedy Island aggregation, and aggregations&#160;at Roviana recorded a maximum abundance of 700 individuals, with densities around 25 individuals per 100 m², which is similar to other locales examined (Hamilton<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;A market&#160;survey conducted in Honiara in 2015-2016, observed 94 individuals of this species, which represent 2% of the total catch and ranked 16th amongst grouper species. These individuals ranged in total length from 19 to 85 cm with an average of 48.1 cm and 33% were immature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpub. data).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Palau:&#160;</strong>Fisher interviews conducted in Palau in 1960-2003 recorded decadal declines in grouper catch, which included&#160;<em>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</em>,&#160;<em>E. polyphekadion</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Plectropomus areolatus&#160;</em>(Palau Conservation Society and SCRFA 2010). Known and suspected spawning aggregations of this species were identified through anecdotal fisher interviews at six sites in Palau. Hundreds of individuals of this species have been observed at two aggregation sites in Palau in recent years. A fish market survey conducted in August 2010 (during spawning season) recorded relatively low numbers of this species<em>&#160;</em>(n=39) with a mean total length of only 33 cm, which is likely indicative that declines had occurred due to overfishing (PCS and SCRFA 2011). At three Palau aggregation sites, interannual variations in abundance were observed from 1994-1996, with peaks of around 300-349 fish at Ngerumkaol in all years, peaks at Ebiil in 1995 of 205 fish and 337 fish in 1996 and peaks at Western Entrance of less than 185 fish in 1995 and 137 fish in 1996 (Johannes&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999). In 2009, surveys reported the Ebiil aggregation size was similar to that in 1996 (Palau Conservation Society and SCRFA 2010).<br/><strong><br/>Papua New Guinea:&#160;</strong>Aggregation size in Papua New Guinea ranged from 32 to 153 individuals from 2005 to 2006 (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). A creel survey conducted in Kavieng and Dyaul Islands recorded that this species contributed to 4% of the total weight of spear and line catches and total lengths ranged from 19.5 to 50.8 cm (Waldie <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><strong><br/>Kenya:&#160;</strong>Underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted in Kenya's Diani-Chale Marine Reserve confirmed the existence of a spawning aggregation site there&#160;(Samoilys <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;A fisheries survey recorded 23 individuals of this species (3.7% of the total catch)&#160;in southern Kenya (Simoni, Vanga and Msambweni) and a single individual (&lt; 0.1% of the total catch) at southern and northern landing sites (Agembe<em> et al</em>. 2010).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>India:&#160;</strong>In the southwest India seamount fishery, this was an abundant species in the catch, and ranged in total length from 46 to 86 cm (Bineesh<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Australia (Great Barrier Reef):<em>&#160;</em></strong>During an experimental line fishing survey, 577 individuals of this species were captured and ranged in total length from 25 to 95 cm and ranged in age from 1 to 42 years (Mapleston <em>et al</em>. 2009). This species represents 1.2% of the total commercial catch (Pears<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Indonesia: </strong>Underwater surveys conducted&#160;to about 30 m depth&#160;at 19 reef sites across Indonesia from 2004-2013 recorded very few individuals of this species (COREMAP database, Indonesian Government). From 2004-2013 there was a reduction in numbers of aggregating individuals of this species despite limited protection initiated in 2001, and both sites are still heavily fished by local artisanal fishers (Pet <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is one of the top 6 species exported from Indonesia for the live fish export trade, although in relatively small volumes (about 12 tonnes wild-caught in 2015). According to export data, 87% of the individuals of this species were below the size of sexual maturation (M. Chazanah pers. comm. 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Maldives:<em>&#160;</em></strong>The live reef food fish trade began in the Maldives in 1993, and at that time, this species was rare on reef slope, reef crest and shallow lagoon areas&#160;at North Malé and Thaa Atoll (Sluka and Reichenbach 1996). By 1997, mean size had declined, but density remained the same (Sluka 1997). In 2010, Fishwatch surveys conducted at North Huvadhu, Baa, North Malé and Haa Alifu recorded low densities and biomass of this species (&lt;1 individual per 500 m² or 0.157 g/m²). According to fisher interviews and quantitative surveys, all grouper species experienced population declines in the Maldives (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011).&#160;This species was the most highly ranked grouper in terms of quantity and value among live exports in 2010, and ranked 12th and 6th among groupers in chilled exported groupers. In 2010, the capture method was primarily spearfishing on snorkel (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain <em>E. fuscoguttatus</em> from traders for scientific study due to its high-value and declining catch (V. Evans and S. Hashim pers. comm. 2017). Larger fish may now be exported frozen, a practice that is relatively new and may be associated with declines in preferred market-size individuals. A clear decline in catch-per-unit-effort for all groupers was noted from 1995 to 2002 and similar declines were observed in exported volumes from 1995 to 2004, along with a general decrease in value (Sattar and Adams 2005).&#160;Live grouper export volumes peaked around 1996 at &gt;500 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>&#160;and declined thereafter to about 125 mt in 2010 (Sattar <em>et al.</em> 2011; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information).&#160;According to grouper fishers in the Maldives, large quantities of this species as well as larger sized individuals of <em>E. fuscoguttatus</em> and <em>Plectropomus </em>species could no longer be found by 2010 and about 90% of exported individuals of this species are now juveniles with sizes much reduced compared to 2003 (Sattar <em>et al.</em> 2011). In August 2011, there were seven main export companies operating, up from three in 2003-2006 (Sattar <em>et al.</em> 2011). The volume of chilled groupers increased and was higher in 2010 (approximately 450 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>) relative to the lowest recorded volumes in 2004 (125 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, the mean total length declined from about 68 cm in the unexploited stocks (1987-1991) to less than 45 cm in 2003 and to 35 cm in 2010-2011, and 96% of individuals were immature (Sattar <em>et al.</em> 2011, Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011).<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>Fiji: </span>Surveys conducted on a&#160;spawning aggregation&#160;in Kadavu, Naiqoro Passage in 2009-2011 recorded&#160;a maximum of about 130 individuals&#160;over the three years of spawning seasons; however,&#160;local fishers reported that this aggregation was much larger in the past, and that poaching occurs at night (Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;2011). Grouper aggregations, including this species, form in northern Vanua Levu outer reef passages and are intensively fished to supply both local and international markets, and in 2015, the total estimated grouper catch&#160;was in excess of 20 mt, which is considered unsustainable. In the past, catches larger than that were also taken from Bua when the live reef food fish trade was targeting aggregations for export. The Mali Passage aggregation is also no longer considered productive after protracted fishing at that site. Much of the current fishery appears to be illegal, unregulated and unmonitored and is heavily reliant on both night-time and SCUBA spearfishing. Catch-per-unit-effort also declined substantially in just 10 years. Due to overfishing, this species is also now uncommon in the local markets despite its continued high-value (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Multiple sites (Pacific):&#160;</strong>The species typically represents less than 5% of the total catch in local markets in the Pacific Islands (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data). Some international trade occurs between Pacific Island countries to Southeast Asia as part of the live reef food fish trade. During underwater surveys conducted across 17 Pacific Island localities in 2002-2009, this species was only rarely observed at eight of them (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), and was not observed in the other sites, including the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Wallis and Futuna. Overall, only 25 individuals of this species were observed out of 7,578 groupers (Pacific Procfish Database 2002-2009); however, the species may have been missed during surveys since it is typically not as visible to divers except during spawning aggregation season.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Western Indian Ocean: </strong>Underwater surveys conducted in the Western Indian Ocean, including in Mozambique, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Chagos and Djibouti, reported this species in low densities, including in Chagos which is ostensibly protected from fishing (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016). These data indicate that the species occurs in low densities except when forming spawning aggregations (Chagos: 0.019 fish/250 m² in 2014; Mozambique: 0.018 fish/250 m² in 2010-2011; Tanzania: 0.11 fish/250 m² in 2009 and 0.22 fish/250 m² in 2011;&#160;Djibouti: 0.057 fish/250 m² in 2014).&#160;The mean number of individuals of this species in the Kenyan spawning aggregation site was 7.6 fish/1,000 m²,&#160;which is 4 to 10 fold less than aggregations in the Solomon Islands, Palau, Micronesia and the Seychelles (Samoilys <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Seychelles (Farquhar Atoll) spawning aggregation size peaked at 1,050 individuals in January 2004 and January 2005 (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific, along east Africa from Mozambique to the Red Sea, east to Samoa and the Phoenix Islands, north to Japan and south to Australia. It is not known from the Persian Gulf, Hawaii and French Polynesia. It is also recorded from Hibernia Reef in the Timor Sea south of Timor-Leste (B. Russell pers. comm. 2016) and Pratas Island (Dong Sha) in the South China Sea (P. Chan pers. comm. 2016). Its depth range is 1-70 metres.<br/><br/>Spawning aggregations are known from the Seychelles, British Indian Ocean Territory, Kenya, Palau, Pohnpei (Micronesia), Melanesia (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia), Komodo National Park (Indonesia), Dumbea (New Caledonia) and Fiji.","This species is commonly targeted by spear and hook-and-line fisheries.&#160;It is caught incidentally in multi-species artisanal and small-scale local fisheries and targeted by commercial export fisheries for the international&#160;Southeast Asian live reef&#160; fish food&#160;trade.&#160;It is a component of the Chuuk (Micronesia) export trade to Guam and Hawaii. It is also exported for the chilled fish trade from Fiji and the Maldives, and the value of chilled grouper exports, at least in China, appears to be increasing.&#160;Individuals are also taken from the wild for grow-out in aquaculture ventures. It is one of the most commonly cultured species (by hatchery) and also now heavily traded in hybrid form as the Sabah Grouper (<em>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus </em>x<em> E. lanceolatus</em>), which is a combination said to be fast-growing and with good flesh.",Marine,"Studies have shown that protected areas have densities of this species that are around 10-fold higher as compared to non-protected areas (M. Samoilys unpublished data, K. Rhodes pers. comm., Pears unpub. thesis).<br/>The Pohnpei State Government began implementing measures in the 1980s to reduce fishing effort on groupers, including a partial sales ban during the spawning season (March to April), but subsistence fishing on aggregations continued during the closed season. In 1995, the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary was established, but the spawning aggregation site of this species was excluded, so fishing continued. Spawning aggregation sites in Ant Channel (Ant Atoll) and Palikir Pass (unconfirmed) have also been protected under the state sanctuary act; however, only the Ant site is enforced. A catch size limit was also instituted, but is also not enforced.&#160;In Chuuk, Micronesia, a ban on the catch, sale or export of groupers occurs annually from 1 January to 31 May.<br/><br/>In Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, reef dynamiting and night spearfishing on spawning aggregations are prohibited; however, some young fishermen ignore the night spearfishing ban. In Buka Island, the power of community leaders to enforce closures within their respective communities appears to have declined considerably in recent years (Hamilton 2003), but regulations are being developed for this and other species that would include minimum sizes and seasonal protection (R. Hamilton pers. comm. 2017). In Komodo Marine Park, Indonesia, there are spawning aggregation protected zones, and despite a monitoring and enforcement lapse in 2004 and 2005 which resulted in abundance declines, this species steadily increased from 2006 to 2009 at one site, while a second site continued to decline (Mangubhai <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Australia, there are minimum catch size and bag limits for this species as well as a commercial catch quota according to the Queensland Coral Reef Fin Fish Management Plan. In Honiara in the Solomon Islands, a management plan for the live reef fish trade was drafted in 2001-2002 that intended to ban aggregation fishing for five days on either side of the new moon during the three months of the year when aggregations are known to form (Donnelly 2001, Oreihaka pers. comm. 2003). At the time of this assessment, the Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources has yet to act on this ban. The Solomon Islands government rewrote the Fisheries Act in 2016 and is currently developing national level regulations, including management measures for this and several grouper species (R. Hamilton pers. comm. 2017). In Palau, the Marine Protection Act of 1994 prohibited the sale of this species from April 1 through July 31 each year, which is intended to protect spawning aggregations. In 1995, this was amended to prohibit any capture even for subsistence during the closed period (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999). A four-month ‘bul’ (taboo) was enforced in the state of Ngeremlengui, but was not completely effective in preventing fishing on the spawning aggregation (Johannes 1999). Recently, the ban was extended from 1 April to 31 October and a 3-year ban commenced in July 2015 (to July 2018) in Ngarchelong and Kayangel States. In Malaysia, marine parks were established under the Fisheries Act of 1985 for the protection of breeding grounds and habitat of aquatic life, which may provide some protection for this species. In the Seychelles, a live reef fish ban was put in place in 2005 (Aumeeruddy and Robinson 2006). Several marine protected areas are established in the Maldives, but they occur over only a small portion of the total reef area and all are poorly enforced, and there is no official management plan in place for the grouper fishery (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). Catch size limits for this species were introduced in March of 2014 (Sattar <em>et al. </em>2014).","",,false,false,Global
100553967,61339,Epinephelus polyphekadion,Vulnerable,A2bd,2018,2016-11-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Epinephelus polyphekadion</em> is a widely distributed species that inhabits shallow coral reefs. It is naturally uncommon, but can be locally abundant during spawning season when it migrates to sites to form sometimes very large aggregations. These spawning aggregations are heavily targeted by fishers through much of its range, and the species is frequently exported to supply the live reef fish trade based in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Due to overfishing, it has experienced steep population declines in many areas. Evidence of this is provided by anecdotal information collected during fisher interviews, depletion or extirpation of historical aggregations, reduced fish size, increasing catch of juveniles, underwater surveys and quantitative trends in landings exported to the international market. Specifically, exports to Hong Kong have declined by 71% over the past generation length (1999-2016), which reflects declines in population, not fishing effort. While a highly sought after species, it can now only be obtained in a few hundred tonnes each year (multiple countries combined) compared to most other popular (valuable) live fishes which are imported in thousands of tonnes. Declines have been documented in the following nine countries: New Caledonia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, French Polynesia, Maldives, Indonesia and Micronesia. Other countries where fishing is known to occur, but its status is not known include the following seven countries: Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, Seychelles, British Indian Ocean Territory, Tuvalu and the Cook Islands. Four more countries have documented exports to the Hong Kong market since 1999, but no further information is available (i.e., Taiwan which mostly produces groupers by grow-out of juveniles). Effective conservation measures to reduce fishing effort are in place in Australia; however, enforcement is lacking and insufficient to allow population recovery elsewhere. Given this, and its continued high-value in the international market, effort and declines are inferred to have been constant and may even increase into the future due to lack of management in all key supply areas for the live fish trade which is the biggest pressure for this species.<br/><br/>Based on these data, a global level decline of at least conservatively 30% is suspected to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (a period of 69 years; 1947-2016). Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bd. Actions are needed to reduce fishing effort on spawning aggregations, control exports (minimum size and quota) in the live fish trade, and&#160;especially the implementation and enforcement of site-based protected areas and/or seasonal protection from fishing during the brief annual reproductive period. Improvements in data collection and population monitoring are also needed.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","<p>This species prefers shallow coral-rich areas in lagoons and outer reefs and is more abundant around islands, particularly atolls. It is usually solitary or in small schools (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Maximum reported length is about 90 cm, but is typically no larger than 70 cm total length. The species appears to be gonochoristic (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2011), and hermaphroditism has been suggested, but not confirmed.&#160;Data from the Great Barrier Reef, New Caledonia, Pohnpei and Papua New Guinea suggest an age of sexual maturation at about four years and a maximum overall age of 42 years (Mapleston <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rhodes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, K. Rhodes and B. Taylor unpublished data 2016). In Papua New Guinea, maximum age was 22 years and age at maturity was 6.8 years (P. Waldie unpublished data 2017).&#160;Applying an age at maturity of four and longevity of 42, its estimated generation length is 23 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.<br/><br/>This species migrates using regular reproductive migratory corridors of varying distances to form seasonal spawning aggregations that can contain hundreds to a few thousand individuals with a maximum reported at two sites (Pohnpei and the Tuamotus)&#160;of 20,000 (Robinson<em> et al</em>. 2008, Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Bijoux <em>et al.</em> 2013, K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). A study in Pohnpei&#160;showed that spawning occurred on several nights during the full moon period during each of the months between February and April (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b).&#160;Aggregation sites are known from Palau, Pohnpei (Micronesia), Mauritius, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Seychelles, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Maldives, Indonesia, French Polynesia (Tuamotus), New Caledonia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia) and probably also in Malaysia. In a study conducted in Palau, mature females were between 30 and 47 cm fork length, mature males between 34 and 50 cm and immature fish between 24 and 29 cm, which indicates that sexual maturation occurred between about 29 and 30 cm (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sexual maturation in 50% of females occurred at about 27 cm standard length in Pohnpei and there was no evidence for sex change (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b). In Chuuk, 50% sexual maturity for females occurred at about 31 cm total length (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). It has a relatively low population turnover rate,&#160;and a natural mortality of 0.144 yr<sup>-1&#160;</sup>(Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>Overfishing by commercial and recreational fisheries is a major threat to this species. Spawning aggregation sites and timing are often widely-known by fishers, and easily accessed in outer reef passages. In some locations, the species utilizes predictable reproductive migratory corridors to and from aggregation sites, which increases its susceptibility to exploitation. Given its continued high-value in the international market, and the fact that fishing is insufficiently managed in most areas, it is inferred that populations will continue to decline, especially due to heavy fishing of spawning aggregations and the high frequency of juveniles in the catch (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Colin 2012). Secondarily, degradation of the coral reefs that this species inhabits is expected to increase due to impacts from climate change, including rising water temperatures. Land-based activities, such as logging and coastal development also contribute to reef degradation.</p>","<p>This species is naturally uncommon throughout its range. Underwater surveys to 15 metres depth conducted in 17 countries and 71 sites between 2002 to 2009 indicate low numbers of individuals at most locales (e.g., Fiji, French Polynesia, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna). The species was not observed at Cook Islands, Nauru or Niue; however, the species may or may not be more naturally abundant in depths deeper than where these surveys were conducted (PROCFish/C/CoFish 2002-2009).&#160;According to microsatellite and mtDNA data, this species is&#160;comprised of at least three main subpopulations: 1. the Indian Ocean (including Phuket and Maldives); 2.French Polynesia; and 3.the Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean (from Cocos Keeling to Fiji). A strong genetic break is located west of Cocos Keeling and a weaker one east of Fiji. Population differentiation within the Pacific Ocean and Eastern Indian Ocean population is generally weak, but the Cocos Keeling population was genetically distinct from all other populations (K. Yan Ma, K. Hou Chu, Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson, S. Newman, M. Berumen, J.H. Choat, L. van Herwerden unpub. data 2016). It is also likely that genetic sub-structuring occurs within Pohnpei (Rhodes<em> et al.</em> 2003) and the Solomon Islands.<br/><br/>This species is heavily targeted during spawning aggregations, and therefore, declines in aggregation size are inferred to mirror overall population decline. Despite its very wide distribution, this species forms relatively few distinctive large spawning aggregations. At least 57 spawning aggregation sites across ten countries that are heavily fished have been documented, and these are very likely to represent a substantial proportion of its global level population (of sexually active adults). Of these sites, data are available for 25 of them, and about half of these have shown some or severe declines occurring over three generation lengths. Those where declines have not been detected are typically under some protection from fishing or are newly exploited (<a href=""http://www.scrfa.org/"">www.SCRFA.org</a>&#160;database accessed November 2016). Declines in landings from aggregations have been reported from Palau, Indonesia, Pohnpei, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Aggregations have been nearly extirpated from the Philippines, Indonesia, Maldives, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, Melanesia (including Palau and Fiji) and French Polynesia, and declines have been observed in other localities as well. Virtually every place that this species is exploited has shown declining catches from aggregations with the exception of certain localities where effective conservation actions have been implemented and enforced (<a href=""http://www.scrfa.org/"">www.SCRFA.org</a>&#160;database November 2016). This species is typically not often managed or otherwise protected.<br/><br/>Imports of this species into Hong Kong, which is the global trade centre of the live reef food fish trade, have reportedly been sourced from the following countries at varying levels since 1999: Taiwan, the Philippines, Maldives, Malaysia and Indonesia. Sources are also reported to be mainland China, Vietnam, Thailand, but these come from other countries either by transit or are imported as juveniles and grown-out to market size (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017).&#160;Overall, imports to Hong Kong declined by about 71% from 700 to about 200 tonnes over the past 17 years (1999-2016) (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department). In the 1990s, this species comprised about 1,200 tons of the total annual volume of fish imported into Hong Kong (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999). These declines are attributed mostly to declines in the Philippines and Indonesia, which have typically been the two major source areas for this trade. This reflects declines in population, not declines in fishing effort.&#160;Due to its continued high-value in the market, effort is not expected to decline, and may even increase. Individuals of this species for retail sale are&#160;smaller on average (closer to size of sexual maturation) as compared to 15 years ago (Lee and Sadovy 1998, Lam 2013). Since this species often co-aggregates with two other groupers also sought in the live fish trade&#160;<em>(E. fuscoguttatus </em>and <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>), it will continue to be fished even if it yields only low numbers as long as the other species are present. Data from trade (predominantly the live fish trade which is the single major fishing pressure on the species), underwater surveys and catch indicate an overall suspected 30% decline over the past three generation lengths (a period of 69 years; 1947-2016).<strong><br/><br/>Seychelles:</strong><em>&#160;S</em>pawning aggregations, which can be comprised of up to 1,900 individuals and peak density of 0.30 individuals per m²,&#160;are targeted in the Seychelles&#160;(Robinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), but data to detect population trends are not available.

Sadovy de Mitcheson pers. comm. 2016).&#160;Compared to past observations, this species is now infrequently seen in Indonesia and marked declines have been qualitatively noted in some localities (J. Pet pers. obs. 2016). Underwater surveys conducted in Komodo in 1998 and 2007 recorded a decline in mean size of this species: from 48 cm in 1998 to 39 cm total length in 2007, and a decline in abundance in aggregations of 46% occurred in 2004/2005 (Mangubhai<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011). Counts of this species across all aggregation sites&#160;declined&#160;from about 10 individuals in 1998 to zero in 2008. This species was not recorded during underwater surveys conducted annually at 19 sites in western and eastern Indonesia from 2004 to 2013 (COREMAP project S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016).&#160;It is rarely recorded in Indonesian fisheries, with just four individuals caught out of 210,000 reef fishes over multiple years (J. Pet pers. comm. 2016); this is due to overfishing since it was formerly not uncommon in coastal catches and known in multiple places to have spawning aggregations (the primary source of fish for this species).<em>&#160;</em>Of the eight spawning aggregations documented during fisher interviews by the Society for the Conservation of Reef Fish Aggregations (SCRFA), one has a stable catch per unit effort, but the remainder are reportedly in decline (<span lang=""EN-GB"">SCRFA&#160;2014). Catch data from a major exporter, who also buys directly from fishers shows that out of 60 fish collection areas in the country (central to eastern areas) only two yielded this species out of all the groupers taken, in any numbers; at these two sites maximum monthly catches were between about 200 and 1,500 kg between 2014 and 2016 (Anonymous to Y.

Overall, landings have declined from a peak of 1,500 kg in 2001 and fluctuated between two and 230 kg with no clear trend since 2007, which represents about a 93% decline over the past 16 years (BFAR-NFRDI 2017). Until 2006, catch from the Philippines was a major source to the Hong Kong live reef fish trade, but has dropped to less than 20 metric tonnes annually. It is very likely, however, that imports reportedly from Malaysia over the last decade should actually be attributed to the Philippines (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department).<strong><br/><br/>Australia:<em>&#160;</em></strong>There are no documented declines in Australian waters, but its status is not clear.&#160;The non-aggregation density on the Great Barrier Reef is generally less than 0.03 (Pears 2005).<strong style=""""><br/><br/>Papua New Guinea:</strong><em>&#160;</em>The species was fished in some areas of Papua New Guinea prior to 2004 for the live reef food fish export trade, but over the past decade, no imports of this species into Hong Kong have been recorded.

Underwater surveys conducted in New Ireland Province between 2005 and 2009 reported significant increases in density of this species following effective protection of two of the three aggregation sites in 2004; fishing has virtually eliminated the aggregation at Bolsurik, one of the three known aggregation sites.

In recent years, however, live fish exports have declined as the more valuable species, including <em>E. polyphekadion</em> have declined and chilled/frozen trade have increased in other species such as <em>Cephalopholis </em>species. This is thought to be a result of very severe overfishing of valuable species and a case of exporting whatever fishermen can catch&#160;(V. Evans and S. Hashim pers. comm. 2017). Such is the concern about the live fish trade that there is discussion about multiple management measures and even an export ban (Sattar<em> et al.</em> 2014).&#160;At least one spawning aggregation site exists in the Maldives, but its status is unknown (Sluka 2000). Underwater surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 in the Maldives recorded a density of less than one individual per 500 m². Estimated biomass in 2010 was 0.05 tons/km² and 225 tons throughout the entire Maldives. It is infrequently observed outside of the spawning season and is a generally uncommon species in the Maldives (Tamelander&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). It was heavily targeted in the Maldives (Sluka 2002), but not particularly favoured by local people.&#160;This was once an important species taken for the Maldivean live reef food fish export trade to Southeast Asia (Johannes and Riepen 1995), but is no longer amongst the top 17 species of live fish exported. Since 1999, exports from the Maldives to Hong Kong were less than 50 metric tonnes a year, and since 2014, it has not occurred in any exports (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department). Its mean length in catches&#160;taken from Baa, Kaafu, Vaavu and Faafu atolls&#160;was 20-45 cm (Sattar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<em>New Caledonia</em><em>. </em>Underwater surveys (2,000 transects) in New Caledonia indicated this species is not common in the zero to 10 metres depth (0.00009 fish/m²), but that sizes are large (41 cm fork length).

The average size was 35 cm total length, and 34% were below the size of sexual maturity (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data 2016).<em>&#160;</em>Underwater surveys conducted in 2009 at Njari Island (Ghizo, Western Province, Solomon Islands) recorded that aggregations formed densities nearing 25 individuals per 1,000 m². Aggregations of lower density were also observed at another site (Nusa Agana) in 2011 and 2012 (Hughes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). In Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, aggregations peak at around 300 individuals and a density of up to 15 individuals per 1,000 m² (Hamilton<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). Historical live reef food fish trade operations have predominantly been pulse fishing events that target seasonal grouper spawning aggregations.&#160;Historically, fishing pressure on reef fish resources of the Solomon Islands has been light, and catch rates of&#160;<em>Epinephelus</em>&#160;species show no decline or only slight decline over the past few decades (Hamilton 2003, see also <a href=""www.scrfa.org"">www.scrfa.org</a> database).<strong style=""""><br/><br/>Tuvalu:</strong><em>&#160;</em>Spawning aggregations occur on some atolls in Tuvalu and catch by fishers is for local consumption, with some minor exports from national urban centres. Anecdotal information from the 1990s did not reveal any significant population reduction (Passfield 1996), and the current status is unknown.<strong style=""""><br/><br/>Fiji:</strong>&#160;Fisher interviews and field surveys that have been conducted since 2008 recorded that the spawning aggregation of Naiqoro Passage in Kadavu Island (Fiji), where large catches of this species were previously reported by fishers, had just a few hundred individuals remaining. Some aggregations near urban centres, such as Mali Passage, had completely disappeared (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and SCRFA unpublished data 2016). Interviews conducted from 2003-2005 with fishers showed marked declines in four different aggregation sites in northern Vanua Levu from about 100 kg to less than 20 kg per boat per day (Sadovy 2006). One major exporter exported approximately 20 metric tonnes of grouper in 2014, much of which is likely to be&#160;<em>E. polyphekadion</em>&#160;(N. Kuridrani pers. comm. 2015). In northern Vanua Levu in 2015, several reef passages along the Great Sea Reef still hosted this and several other groupers in aggregations despite heavy fishing and apparently declining numbers over the prior decade (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).<em>&#160;</em>Groupers were among the most intensively fished taxa around Kadavu Island in Fiji and abundance of this species&#160;ranged from 0.15 to 1.84 g m<sup>-2&#160;</sup>in 10 fishing grounds in the area (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999). Nine aggregations around the coastline of Fiji&#160;have been identified for this species, seven of which are in decline based on catch per unit effort data collected during fisher interviews (<span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""http://www.scrfa.org/"">www.scrfa.org</a>&#160;accessed 2015). On one aggregation, catch per boat per trip declined from 300 kg in 1985 to 100 kg by the mid-1990s and to only 12 to 20 individuals by 2002/2003 (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and Kuridrani unpublished data 2008). Grouper catches have been declining and effort increasing on northern Vanua Levu reefs as its export value remains high (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).&#160;Fisher interviews (n=63) indicated that catch on aggregation sites has declined about ten-fold over the past two decades around Fiji (Kuridrani 2008).&#160;Unregulated&#160;fishing and poaching is still occurring according to&#160;local communities in much of Fiji&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).<strong style=""""><br/><br/>Micronesia:</strong>&#160;Underwater monitoring conducted across Micronesian reefs between three to 10 metres depth, observed only nine individuals of this species<em>&#160;</em>at four of nine sites (P. Houk unpublished data 2016). Underwater surveys conducted across Micronesia recorded only four individuals of this species<em>&#160;</em>across eight islands/atolls and 55 stations (about 29 total hectares surveyed)&#160;(B. Taylor unpublished data 2016).<em>&#160;</em>During a 12-month market survey in 2005, 383 individuals were sampled (20.7% of all groupers sampled), size ranged from 17.1 to 40.6 cm standard length and 47.4% were immature (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). A follow-up market survey in 2015/2016, reported that this species represented 30.2% of all groupers (n = 899), sizes ranged from 17 to 57 cm total length and 56% were immature (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).<em>&#160;</em>A&#160;12-month market and export survey in Chuuk in 2014 sampled 3,419 individuals of this species, which represented 11.2% of all fish landings and 5% by volume. Sizes averaged 33 cm and 45% were immature. Few gravid individuals were observed, which suggests that spawning aggregation fishing may be relatively low in Chuuk (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).<em>&#160;</em>A very large spawning aggregation in Pohnpei is now substantially reduced from an estimated 20,000 fish in 1998 to 1,000 fish in 2013 (&lt;90% decline). Due to&#160;continued heavy fishing pressure on aggregations and take of juveniles, this species now has a truncated age and size in Pohnpei (Rhodes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Underwater surveys at the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary conducted from 2001 to 2013 recorded a declining trend in aggregation densities, from about 125 individuals per 100 m<sup>-2</sup>&#160;in 2005 to 25 individuals in 2013 presumably due to the lack of enforcement following 2005 (Rhodes <em>et al. </em>2014). In 1999, local fishermen landed an estimated 4,000 pre-spawning individuals from the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary over a seven-day period, which is about 20–30% of the aggregation (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b). In addition, both age and size were significantly reduced within the spawning population of the sanctuary in 1999, particularly in 13 to 18 year-old fish (Rhodes<em> et al</em>. 2011). Six aggregation sites were identified through fisher surveys conducted by the Society for the Conservation of Reef Fish Aggregations and fishers reported declines over multiple decades. The Ebiil spawning aggregation site once yielded high catches of groupers (<em>Epinephelus polyphekadion</em>,<em> E. fuscoguttatus</em>, <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>), but according to fisher interviews, declined by about 86% from c. 1,500 kg per trip in the 1960s to less than 200 kg per trip in the early 2000s (PCS and SCRFA 2011). The site has been relatively effectively protected&#160;since 2010 (PCS and SCRFA 2011), and data indicate the population is no longer declining, but recovery to pre-fishing numbers is not yet known (Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2014).&#160;At least five grouper spawning aggregations of Palau have possibly disappeared since the 1970s according to fisher interviews (Johannes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Sadovy 2007, PCS and SCRFA 2010). Numbers appear to be increasing at the Ulong aggregation site due to improved protection<strong>&#160;</strong>(Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and A. Bukurrou unpublished data 2015). It was once exported live to Hong Kong from Palau, but this trade has now been banned and is now used only domestically.<strong style=""""><br/><br/>Cook Islands:</strong>&#160;Fishermen target spawning aggregations in Taruia Passage in the Cook Islands with catch rates of about 10 to 12 fish per man hour. Anecdotal information does not suggest significant reduction in population (Passfield 1996). No further more recent information is available from this area.<strong style=""""><br/><br/>French Polynesia:</strong><em>&#160;</em>A survey (510 transects) conducted across 10 atolls in French Polynesia in 1996 reported this species at a&#160;density of 0.02 fish/m² and an average size of 34 cm fork length. This species was reportedly a major component of the commercial catch in the 1980s on Tikehau atoll in the Tuamotus, but is no longer observed there (M. Kulbicki pers. comm.&#160;2016).&#160;Many of the atolls of the Tuamotus have large aggregations of this species, and fishing has caused some of them to decline markedly (S. Planes pers. comm. 2010). Due to the presence of a tourist resort and biosphere reserve, a very large aggregation (10,000-20,000 individuals) on Fakarava Atoll is not fished (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Clua 2011, Y.

In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan to southern Queensland, Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and Lord Howe Island (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Its depth range is one to 60 metres.</p>","<p>This species supports relatively low volume fisheries through much of its range, but is highly valued in the international live reef fish export trade of southeast Asia, and to a lesser extent in the western Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean. Nearly all landings are taken from spawning aggregations. Currently, the major exporting countries are the Philippines and Indonesia; Thailand, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and the Maldives formerly contributed to the trade, but no imports to Hong Kong from these countries have occurred in recent years (Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department 2015). It is also commercially important in the southern part of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia (Rasem&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997). It is caught with hook-and-line, spears and traps in Australia and Papua New Guinea (Heemstra and Randall 1993). It can be hatchery-produced, but this is not currently commercially viable.<br/></p>",Marine,"<p>A number of management plans are in place for this species, although enforcement is mostly poor to lacking. Measures include minimum catch size limits, seasonal fishing bans, aggregation site protection and export bans.<br/><br/>The export of wild-caught groupers from Indonesia is restricted to local Indonesian companies, which reduced fishing effort; however, some illegal trade remains (Anonymous pers. comm. 2016). In Indonesia's Karimunjawa National Park, there is a time and site closure for fishing of&#160;<em>E. polyphekadion</em>&#160;(Yulianto&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Since&#160;the 1980s, the Pohnpei State Government has implemented measures to reduce fishing effort on groupers, including a sales ban during the main spawning season; however, subsistence fishing is still permitted and there are no limits on the number of individuals that can be taken. There is also a 16-inch size limit regulation in place in Pohnpei, but it is insufficiently enforced. The sales ban may also be mostly ineffective since aggregations in close proximity to population centres and major fishing villages are still targeted outside the ban period and during some spawning months not covered by the ban (i.e., February). As of 1999, the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary of Pohnpei was expanded to provide protection for aggregations, but effective enforcement is lacking and declines have been noted, particularly since private enforcement ended in 2005. In 2014, a second aggregation site at Ant Channel was protected by a combination of private enforcement and the implementation of the Pohnpei Ant Atoll Marine Sanctuary. A third possible aggregation site was protected in 2015 by the inclusion of Palikir Pass (Channel) in the Pohnpei marine sanctuary system; no foreign fishing vessels are allowed and there are entry restrictions for divers at one site.<br/><br/>In Chuuk (Micronesia), the government imposed a grouper catch and export ban 1 January through 31 May that reduces fishing effort on this species (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).<br/><br/>Concerns for the species in Fiji has led the government to&#160;consider implementing protective measures during spawning season. In addition, a national campaign advising the public to not consume the species during spawning season aims to reduce take by local fishers.<br/><br/>The Palau Marine Protection Act of 1995 prohibits the sale or purchase of <em>Epinephelus polyphekadion</em>&#160;(even for subsistence purposes) from April 1 through July 31, as a means to reduce fishing on spawning aggregations (Johannes 1999). This sales ban was recently extended to 31 October and there is a 3-year ban in Ngarchelong and Kayangl State from July 2015 until July 2018. In addition, foreign fishing vessels are no longer permitted, diver restrictions are in place at one site and there is a 50 pound maximum export per person. Enforcement of fishing restrictions has improved in recent years at the Ebiil aggregation site, which is located in a marine protected area (PCS and SCRFA 2010).<em><br/><br/></em>Since December 2003, Australia has implemented several measures to reduce fishing on this species, including catch size and bag limits, restrictions on gear, limited entry for vessels into the reef fishery and establishment of marine protected areas (Queensland Government 2016).<em> </em><br/><br/>A management plan for the live reef food fish&#160;trade was drafted for the Honiara market in the Solomon Islands in 2002 that aimed to provide total protection of spawning aggregations of <em>E. polyphekadion</em> by banning fishing on aggregations for five days on either side of the new moon during the three-month spawning season (Donnelly 2001) and modifying licence conditions (E. Oreihaka pers. comm. 2003); however, enforcement is lacking and<strong>&#160;</strong>only one aggregation site (Roviana) is protected.<br/><br/>In New Caledonia, grouper fishing during spawning season in the area of known aggregations is restricted&#160;(M. Kulbicki pers. comm.&#160;2016). <br/><br/>Management the live fish trade in the<em>&#160;</em>Maldives includes a 31-inch minimum size for <em>E. polyphekadion</em> (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011)<em>.<br/><br/></em>To reduce heavy fishing by the live reef food fish trade in Papua New Guinea, a community-based marine protected area was implemented&#160;at the Bolsurik aggregation site that has measures to specifically reduce grouper catch. A recent monitoring survey showed that aggregation size had increased from 22 individuals in 2005 to 241 in 2009, which demonstrates the potential benefit of small-scale marine protected areas (Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Though almost all spawning aggregations of this species have experienced declines, a large one remains and is protected in the Tuamotu atolls of French Polynesia (Y.

It is heavily exploited and highly valued in markets throughout most of its range. It possesses intrinsic life history characteristics that make it vulnerable to overexploitation which include possible sex change, late age at sexual maturity and aggregate spawning.&#160;Quantified data available up to the year 2000, such as catch per unit effort, landings statistics and fisher interviews, indicate that declines between 50 to 90% are likely to have occurred in Colombia and Mexico. It is also exploited elsewhere in its range, but quantitative data are not available. Considering that this species is still highly valued in the market and there are no effective conservation measures in place, fishing pressure is presumed to have remained at unsustainable levels to present. Applying an exponential regression to extrapolate the data to the past three generation length time window (54 years; 1962-2016), regardless of when the time series started, results in estimated suspected declines ranging from 32-98%. Furthermore, a large proportion of the landings are known to be comprised of immature individuals, which contributes to growth overfishing. Given this decline, and considering the uncertainty in the data, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bd. Research is needed on its population status and fishing effort elsewhere in its range, and conservation measures that effectively reduce fishing effort are highly recommended.&#160;The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>This demersal species inhabits rocky reefs and sandy or muddy bottoms adjacent to reefs at depths of 46 to &gt;100 m (Cudney-Bueno and Turk-Boyer 1998, Thomson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Caceido <em>et al.</em> 2015). Adults and juveniles are thought to occupy the same habitats and depths (Caceido&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). It is uncommon in shallow waters and likely to have a low population density during non-spawning periods (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). It feeds mainly on crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, and stomatopods) (Gómez <em>et al</em>. 1999, Thomson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Chasqui Velasco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Spawning in the Gulf of California occurs in the spring and summer months with a peak in July when fish form spawning aggregations on muddy bottoms (Cudney-Bueno and Turk-Boyer 1998, Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al.</em> 2008, Beldade <em>et al</em>. 2014). Spawning peaks occur in Colombia in July and February (Acevedo 1996). The average length at sexual maturity ranges from 63 to 68.9 cm total length (corresponding to ~8 years of age), longevity is at least 28 years and maximum total length is at least 130 cm (Acevedo 1996, Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2015, Robertson and Allen 2015). Acevedo (1996) concluded that <em>H. acanthistius</em> is a protogynous hermaphrodite, however, the possibility of misdiagnosis of immature bisexual fish as transitional individuals is likely, and the diagnosis of a protogynous sexual pattern remains unconfirmed (B. Erisman pers. obs. 2016). Given a longevity of 28 years and an age of maturity at 8 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski&#160;and Bellwood&#160;(2006), results in one generation length being estimated as 18 years.</p>",Overexploitation is a major threat to this species.,"<p>This species&#160;is commonly targeted in fisheries throughout the Gulf of California and in central Mexico and is occasionally taken on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico (Espino-Barr <em>et al</em>. 2004, Aburto-Oropeza<em> et al.</em> 2008, Ainsworth 2011, Moreno-Báez <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is also heavily exploited on the Pacific coast of Colombia (Chasqui Velasco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Altogether, this area represents a large proportion of the species' global range.<br/><br/>Three generation lengths is estimated to be 54 years; therefore, the time window over which population decline is estimated is from 1962 to 2016. An estimated 50% decline in landings has occurred in Colombia over approximately the past 18 years (one generation length). A greater than 50% decline in both CPUE and landings occurred in the Gulf of California from 1950-2000, and despite the lack of data over the past 15 years, declines are inferred to have continued to the present since fishing effort has continued at unsustainable levels. Fishing pressure is likely at similar levels elsewhere in its range. Based on the information below that includes catch and catch per unit effort data as a proxy for abundance trends, we suspect that population declines of at least 30% and possibly as great as 50% have occurred over the past three generation lengths. Applying an exponential regression to extrapolate the data to the past three generation length time window (54 years; 1962-2016), regardless of when the time series started, results in estimated suspected declines ranging from 32-98%.<br/><br/><strong>Gulf of California/Mexico:</strong>&#160;<em>Hyporthodus acanthistius</em>&#160;was reported to comprise 1.2% of the total fish catch at about 0.3 kg/day in Colima, Mexico from 1983 to 1998 (Espino-Barr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).&#160;Fishers in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico reported that the abundance of this species was much lower in the 2000s as compared to the 1950s. For example, in the 1970s fishers reported catches of a ton per day were common, whereas capturing 100 kg in a day was considered a good catch in the mid 2000s (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008), which loosely translates to a 90% decline in catch per unit effort. Fuzzy logic algorithms using data collected during interviews with fishermen in this area indicate a 50% decline in relative abundance from 1950-2000 (Ainsworth 2011). The Gulf of California fishery for <em>Hyporthodus acanthistius</em>&#160;collapsed in the 1980s, at which point fishers transferred their effort to target sharks. During the 1990s, annual catch of&#160;<em>H. acanthistius</em>&#160;was about 180 tons, but then declined to 20 tons after 2002, which is about a 90% decline. Mean annual landings also declined in San Felipe in the northern Gulf of California from 10 tons in the 1990s to less than 3 tons in the 2000s (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). In addition, approximately 76% of commercial catch of <em>H. acanthistius </em>in the Gulf of California in the mid-2000s was comprised of immature individuals (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008), which may be indicative of growth overfishing.<br/><br/><strong>Colombia:&#160;</strong>Of a total of 356.4 kg of “chernas” and other groupers sampled throughout the Colombian Pacific between 1993 and 1996,&#160;<em>H. acanthistius</em>&#160;represented 22.9% of the total catch by weight (Gómez and Zapata 1999).&#160;Landings of this species&#160;in the Colombian Pacific declined by approximately 50% from 1995 to 2010, and the mean catch size was lower than size at maturity (Chasqui Velasco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The total landings reported for this species in Colombian Pacific fishery statistics were 0.86 tons in 2013&#160;(SEPEC 2013), and this is likely an underestimation of the total catch due to lack of continuity in data collection. Assuming that species reported as ""cherna"" in the fishery statistics correspond to catches of <em>H. acanthistius</em>, annual landings in Colombia since 1990 range between 50 and 200 tons (Chasqui Velasco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Buenaventura, Colombia between 2012-2014, between 68 to 77.5%&#160;of captured individuals of this species measured below the average size at sexual maturity (Chasqui Velasco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).</p><p><strong></strong></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This eastern Pacific species is distributed from southern California (USA) to central Peru (Thomson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robertson and Allen 2015).

It is exploited throughout its range, including take of juveniles, which amplifies overfishing. Population data are limited, but significant reductions observed in Hong Kong in landings and body size over the past 37 years support strong evidence that a suspected 30 to 50% decline has occurred over at least the past three generation lengths (30 years). Life history data are also limited; therefore, the generation length default of 10 years is applied. Fisheries management for this species is very limited throughout its range and fishing pressure continues to be unsustainable, thus, declines are expected to continue.&#160;It is listed as Vulnerable A2bd. Information on this species has been confused with other similar grouper species, and directed efforts to improve conservation, reduce fishing effort and monitor the population are needed. Research on life history parameters would also be beneficial.","This species inhabits mud bottoms and coral and rocky reefs (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Sadovy and Cornish 2000), including artificial reefs (Wilson 2003). Adults can be found in depths from 20 to 200 metres, while juveniles occur in shallower depths to 5 metres (Heemstra and Randall 1993, A. To pers. comm. 2016). Its maximum total length&#160;is 136 cm and maximum weight is 38 kg (J. Schratwieser, IGFA World Records pers. comm. 2007). Information on the reproductive biology, longevity and age at maturity is very limited for this species. It is a relatively large grouper species, and a similar-sized congener is&#160;<em>Epinephelus coioides</em>, which is a protogynous hermaphrodite that can grow up to 114 cm in total length (Craig<em> et al</em>. 2011). Females of <em>E. coioides</em> mature at about two to three years and may reach a maximum age of 22 years or more. Based on these data, the generation length of <em>E. bruneus</em> may be near 12 to 13 years, but this estimation is considered highly uncertain.",Overfishing is a major threat to this&#160;species.,"Relatively little information is currently available for this species across most of its relatively small range. Previously it was described as common and abundant in regional fisheries in the 1970s, but it has declined dramatically over the past 30 years, and is generally regarded as rare in recent years presumably due to overfishing. Based on the available landings data, and significant reductions in body size of individuals marketed in Hong Kong, the species is suspected to have declined by 30 to 50% over the past 30 years (A. To pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Hong Kong:&#160;</strong>This species can frequently be observed on artificial reefs off Hong Kong (Wilson 2003). It was occasionally recorded during an underwater survey (one 30 cm fish in a shallow coral area and a larger individual around large boulders) conducted off Hong Kong (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). It was considered 'rare' in recently conducted underwater surveys in Hong Kong (To<em> et al.</em> 2013). During 187 underwater surveys conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Hong Kong coral and rocky reef and adjacent areas, this species was not observed (Shea and Ho 2016). However, all these survey results should be interpreted with caution and do not fully reflect its status, as it also inhabits muddy substrates, which were not sampled during these studies. This species was once one of the most abundant groupers in Hong Kong in the 1960s and 1970s (about 37 to 56 years ago), and was frequently captured in fisheries by longline, trawl and hand-line (Chan 1968). It was also one of the most common year-round food fishes available in the market (Herklots and Lin 1960). In the 1960s, the maximum total length of this species was slightly over 90 cm, commonly 30 to 60 cm, and all sizes were available in the Hong Kong market (Chan 1968). A government publication from the early 1970s, reported the common size has remained at about 30 to 76 cm (AFD 1972).&#160;The Hong Kong Port Survey report for 1996/1997 reported that zero tonnes of this species were landed (AFCD 1998), which likely indicates that overall catch of this species was either very low or totally absent. This is inferred to be result of overfishing, not a reduction in fishing effort. A&#160;market survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006, recorded a total of 220 wild-caught individuals of this species. Of these, 90% were taken from Hong Kong waters and the remaining were mostly from adjacent waters of the northern South China Sea (To 2009). The average total length of these wild-caught individuals was about 25 ± 7 cm and ranged from 10 to 60 cm, and an estimated 99% were juveniles (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). Currently, it is undoubtedly one of the less common grouper species encountered in the local wet markets, and large individuals of this species (i.e., 50 cm) occur very rarely in local catches (Sadovy and Cornish 2000, To 2009). A&#160;restaurant and wet market survey conducted in 2012/2013 recorded 716 individuals of this species, which comprised about 2.8% of all groupers surveyed in terms of numbers, and 96% were immature (Lam 2013). A&#160;long-term monitoring trawl survey conducted since 2006 in the western waters of Hong Kong,&#160;this was&#160;the most commonly captured grouper species in terms of occurrence, but had a relatively low density (M. Liu unpub. data).<br/><em><br/></em><strong>Taiwan:&#160;</strong>Based on 10 to 15 years of underwater observation from a very limited locality in Taiwan, this species is considered to be naturally rare (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016).",Decreasing,"The nominal species <em>Epinephelus moara&#160;</em>was recently resurrected from synonymy with <em>E. bruneus</em> (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013). At present, the distribution of <em>E. bruneus</em> is from Zhejiang Province to Hainan, China, including western Taiwan. However, the complete distribution of these two species requires further research. Its depth range is 5-200 metres.","This species is exploited by fisheries throughout its range. It is considered an excellent food fish and is captured with gill nets, traps, handlines, longlines and trawls (Heemstra and Randall 1993, To 2009).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures for this species. It is also not known to benefit from no-take marine protected areas. In the South China Sea off China (adjacent to Hong Kong), there is an annual two and a half month fishing moratorium during which trawling and some other types of fishing are banned (except for hook and line and gill-netting). In Hong Kong waters, trawling has been banned since December of 2012. As 71% of wild-caught individuals of this species are reportedly caught by trawl (To 2009), this may reduce fishing effort at some unknown level. There is a critical need for a formal&#160;stock assessment, improvements in fishery monitoring and reductions in fishing effort, especially on juveniles. Research is also needed on its reproductive biology and life history parameters.","",,false,false,Global

Therefore, this species extent of occurrence (EOO) was estimated to be 18,435 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;based on known point localities. Regional experts support the plausible threat of the increased duration and frequency of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events that can cause severe and rapid declines for restricted-range, shallow-water species in this region and therefore it is inferred that there is a continuing decline in habitat quality for this species. The number of locations is uncertain but is likely to be less than 10. In light of its small geographic range (&lt; 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>), its preference for very shallow, coastal marine waters, and the limited number of locations (&lt; 10) where threatened processes from climatic changes are expected to continue and worsen in the future, <em>Opisthonema berlangai</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable&#160;B1ab(iii).

It is known to a maximum standard length of 26 cm but is more common to 18 cm (Whitehead 1985).","In the eastern tropical Pacific, severe localized declines in fish populations have occurred after strong ENSO events that result in shallow waters that are too warm and nutrient poor for extended periods of time (Grove 1985, Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2009). The frequency and duration of ENSO events in this region (e.g. the up-welling zone off the coast of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and the offshore islands) appears to be increasing (Glynn and Ault 2000, Soto 2001, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2004). The effects of ENSO events are thought to be indirectly driving extreme fluctuations in&#160;<em>Engraulis ringens,&#160;</em>a related species distributed in the eastern tropical Pacific.

103433002,41876,Odontaspis ferox,Vulnerable,A2bd,2016,2015-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Smalltooth Sand Tiger (<em>Odontaspis ferox</em>) appears to have an extensive, albeit fragmented, distribution in tropical and warm-temperate latitudes of the world's oceans. Apart from about five shallow water dive locations where it has been seen repeatedly, the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is known from fewer than 200 records suggesting that it is rarely encountered (or reported), or naturally has low population numbers. However, new records continue to accumulate, including several recent captures and a number of photographs and video recordings taken in deepwater at oceanic islands and on submarine seamounts and ridges. With this new distributional information, it is becoming evident that the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is probably continuously distributed across the oceans and around the peripheries of the continents. <br/><br/>Although larger and bulkier, this species is morphologically very similar to the Sand Tiger (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>) and is presumed to have a similarly very low reproductive capacity (producing only two pups every two years). This likely very low fecundity makes it potentially susceptible to local extinction, even at seemingly small capture rates. Although probably not specifically targeted, there are commercial landings of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger from bottom trawls, set-nets and line gear in many parts of the world including the Mediterranean Sea, Japan, Indonesia and (occasionally) Australia. Demersal trawl fisheries off Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa operate in areas of known and likely occurrence. Off the southeastern coast of Australia, fishery-independent surveys indicated a decline of over 50% in catches of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger after 20 years of trawling on the upper slope (200–650 m) off New South Wales. Similar declines are likely to have occurred in other parts of its range impacted by fisheries, such as the in the Mediterranean Sea where the decline of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger is suspected to match or even exceed that in Australia; regionally, the species is currently assessed as Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean. Although it is more often found in depths greater than 200 m (max. depth recorded is 880 m), occurrences of small aggregations of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger in shallow water at a number of locations (eastern tropical Atlantic, eastern and southwestern Pacific Ocean) suggest that the species may be more vulnerable to fishing pressure than previously assumed, and may also be susceptible to coastal habitat impacts similar to those that affected the Sand Tiger (<em>C. taurus</em>).<br/><br/>Globally, there are many parts of its distribution where there seems to be little or no fishery activity, and the species is protected in the waters of some countries e.g. Croatia, Malta, Spain (Mediterranean coast), Colombia (Malpelo Island Sanctuary), Australia (New South Wales), and New Zealand. However, a precautionary assessment of Vulnerable is considered appropriate because of documented and suspected local declines, the species' apparent rarity, its presumed very low fecundity and high vulnerability to exploitation, and its continued bycatch in fisheries in a number of countries.","The Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;is a rarely encountered species that is morphologically very similar to the Sand Tiger (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>)&#160;but larger and bulkier, and has been observed or captured across a much broader depth range (10–880 m).&#160;The species mainly&#160;lives close to the seabed around islands and underwater seamounts characterised by narrow, steeply sloping shelves, or in the deep waters of continental outer shelves and upper slopes of larger land masses.&#160;Fergusson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008) report diver observations and photographs of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;in depths less than 50 m in widely separated locations including Pemba Island (Tanzania), Cocos-Keeling Island in the Indian Ocean, Malpelo Island (Columbia), and the Kermadec and White Islands (New Zealand); all these habitats comprised rocky substrates shelving steeply into deep water. Similarly, most Mediterranean Sea captures were by gillnets and vertical longlines set on steep, rocky ground, although usually at greater depths (100–300 m) than the dive sites (Fergusson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Demersal trawls generally require relatively smooth substrate for the gear to operate, and the many trawl captures off South Africa and southeastern Australia indicate that the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;also frequents smooth terrain, at least in deepwater. Remote video recordings in the Gulf of Mexico showed the species&#160;swimming in 450 m depth over areas of&#160;<em>Lophelia</em> coral reef (Sulak <em>et al</em>. 2007). The records from mid-water trawls in open waters of the Indian Ocean were proximal to deepsea ridges and seamounts, suggesting that the species may also inhabit the pelagic&#160;zone, possibly while moving between shallower localities.<br/><br/>Little is known of the biology of this shark but its reproduction may be similar to that of the Sand Tiger. The maximum recorded size for females is 450 cm TL and 344 cm TL for males but there were insufficient data for Fergusson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008)&#160;to precisely define the size at maturity: males were estimated to mature between 200 and 250 cm TL and females between 300 and 350 cm TL. Age and growth data are not available for the Smalltooth Sand Tiger, but generation length can be estimated from the Sand Tiger (<em>C. taurus</em>) from the Northwest Atlantic which has a female age of maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 35 years, resulting in a generation length of 20.5 years.<br/><br/>Compagno (2001) cites an observation which suggests the species practices uterine cannibalism in the form of oophagy, resulting in the birth of single embryos from each uterus. The smallest recorded neonate, from Taiwan, was&#160;101 cm TL and exhibited an umbilical scar (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2013); this is within the birth size of 100–110 cm TL&#160;suggested&#160;by Fergusson <em>et al</em>. (2008), a size proportionally consistent with the size at birth for the smaller&#160;Sand Tiger&#160;(95–105 cm TL; Compagno 2001). It&#160;probably has a non-continuous breeding cycle similar to, or possibly more extended than the Sand Tiger. The gestation period for the Sand Tiger&#160;is 9–12 months with a probable rest year between pregnancies (Compagno 2001). An analysis by Fergusson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008)&#160;of 64 Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;captures worldwide found a weak inverse relationship between shark size and depth (R<sup>2</sup>&#160;= 0.129; p &lt; 0.05), with small juveniles almost exclusively occurring in deepwater (&gt;200 m). Mature-sized&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;were caught across their whole depth range (15–880 m) but almost all small juveniles (&lt;150 cm TL) came from depths greater than 200 m suggesting that parturition occurs in relatively deep water.","Although this species is not specifically targeted by commercial fishing activities, its likely very low fecundity makes it susceptible to local extinction, even at seemingly small capture rates (Fergusson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Since the 1970s there has been a substantial increase in deepwater fishing effort worldwide. In particular, significant trawl fisheries have developed on the continental slopes and ocean ridges off Australia, New Zealand and southern Africa, and the depths at which the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;commonly lives (300–700 m) are regularly trawled. Similarly, as shallow water fisheries become depleted, fishing gear such as mesh-nets, droplines and longlines are being deployed at increasingly greater depths, often in steep inclines and rough seabed areas favoured by&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger.&#160;Even if incidental captures by trawls or nets were returned to the sea intact, these sharks are unlikely to survive the trauma of their capture from deepwater.&#160;It is very likely that even very low fishing mortality could seriously impact on local viability of a species such as&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;with its intrinsically low reproductive rate and ultimately&#160;may put the survival of the species at risk.&#160;<br/><br/>In addition, the unregulated fishing for sharks for the fin-trade in many remote areas of the world, particularly around oceanic islands, also poses a severe risk to&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger<em>.</em>&#160;A Colombia newspaper article (Sabogal 2007) contended that the problem of shark-finning operations in waters around Malpelo Island, despite fishing being banned in its extensive marine sanctuary, was so critical that species such as&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;were ""in danger of dying out"".&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>In the Mediterranean, dedicated efforts to detail captures and other indices of its abundance only began since about 1995. Regional literature and fisheries data concerning historical captures are generally patchy and lacking in detail, so longer-term trends in its abundance are unknown. Moreover, fisheries records are sometimes confused by the widespread use of similar common names for different Mediterranean species; e.g., 'tiger' shark in Malta may refer to this species or indeed to the Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>) or the Sand Tiger (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>). Occasionally&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;is caught by artisanal fisheries in the Tyrrhenian Sea off Calabria, Italy (M. Vacchi, pers. comm.). The species is uncommon in the Adriatic Sea but its current status there is difficult to assess, because of fishery mis-identifications with other sharks.  Until the mid 1990s, occurrences off Croatia included relatively small (&lt;200 cm TL) specimens caught by trawls and deepwater bottom longlines, which were locally confused with, and marketed as, smoothhound <em>Mustelus</em> spp. (Soldo and Jardas 2002). Since then there have been no more records of the species in the Adriatic (A. Soldo, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In areas of steep untrawlable terrain, characteristic of many locations in the Mediterranean Sea, gillnetting and longlining are likely to impact on local populations, with mature individuals being particularly vulnerable.&#160;Specimens are most often taken nocturnally by bottom gillnets, bottom longlines and vertical setlines operating over, or closely adjacent to, rocky or boulder-strewn seafloors. Trawler captures are likely in various areas (e.g., Sicilian Channel and Adriatic Sea).&#160;Coastal development for tourism, coupled with uncontrolled spearfishing, unregulated coastal fisheries, pollution and increased human aquatic leisure activities may all seriously impact these sharks whilst inhabiting areas outside their deepwater environment, in the same manner that may have accounted for the contemporary acute decline or even disappearance of the (routinely coastal) Sand Tiger from its previous Mediterranean range (Fergusson <em>et al.</em> 2002).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Australia and New Zealand</strong><br/>Incidental captures during commercial trawling on the outer continental shelf and continental slope are a potential threat to its survival in southeastern Australian and New Zealand waters.&#160;The species is now legally protected in&#160;New Zealand and&#160;Australia, but compliance is difficult to enforce and carcasses of juvenile Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;are sometimes marketed in Australia simply as 'shark'.&#160;From the available information, the Smalltooth Sand Tiger was never abundant off New South Wales (NSW), but there is strong evidence that numbers seriously declined between 1972 and 1997. Of the 36 specimens caught by the NSW Fisheries Research Vessel <em>Kapala</em>, 33 were caught between 1975 and 1981 (from 500 slope trawl tows), but only three were taken from about 300 trawl tows made between 1982 and 1997 (Fergusson <em>et al. </em>2008). Comparable data are available for NSW upper slope trawl surveys in 1976–77 and 1996–97 where gear and sampling protocols were similar (see  Graham <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2001). Twelve captures (14 sharks) were made during 246 tows in 1976–77, but only a single juvenile was caught during 165 tows made in 1996–97. A low level of capture of&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;in southeastern Australia's trawl fishery continues with Walker and Gason (2007) estimating an annual catch across the whole fleet of ~3.5 tonnes, with most being retained suggesting that the catch comprised mainly juveniles.<br/><br/>In New Zealand, no catch data were available for the species. However, between 1980 and 2005, up to 20 specimens were caught near White Island, Bay of Plenty, for aquarium display in Auckland but the maximum survival in captivity has been 11 months. There are several records from inshore trawl and gillnet fisheries but greater numbers of unreported captures are likely in New Zealand's deepwater trawl and line fisheries.<br/><br/><strong>South Africa</strong><br/>Small numbers were observed caught on longline gear at about ~300 m along the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, in the late 1980s, and further anecdotal information indicates relatively frequent capture of these sharks (~200 cm TL) during target fishing for deepsea sharks and rays  (D. Ebert, pers. comm., 2004). Recent evidence of possible sightings of shallow water aggregations off the Transkei coast, South Africa, at depths of 20–30 m suggests that this species may be more vulnerable to fishing pressure than previously assumed. There have been unconfirmed, but reliable, reports by divers of small aggregations of&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;off the Transkei coast in South Africa. These sightings have been in depths of 20–30 m in areas of deepwater drop-offs (similar to those encountered off Lebanon), suggesting that this species may be more vulnerable to fishing pressure than previously assumed.<strong><br/></strong>","This species is globally widespread&#160;in warm temperate and tropical seas around islands and on continental shelves and slopes. However, there are relatively few records (&lt;200) suggesting that it is rarely encountered (or reported), or naturally has low population numbers. With such a paucity of data, there has been no attempt to calculate overall population size.&#160;The connectivity of this species between widely separated localities is unknown and its fragmentary occurrences may represent a series of isolated subpopulations. However, Fergusson <em>et al. </em>(2008) hypothesised that the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;may cross large oceanic distances by following submarine ridges and/or moving between islands and seamounts. For example, divers have observed small aggregations at the Kermadec Islands while several Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;have been caught around White Island (North Island, New Zealand) which is almost 1,000 km away at the southern end&#160;of the Kermadec Ridge; there are also several captures and sightings reported from deepwater, above ridges and on submarine seamounts in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.<br/><br/>Regional inter-relationships between Mediterranean&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;and those from other parts of the open Atlantic Ocean (e.g., Azores, Canary Islands) are unknown but, given the cosmopolitan distribution of this species and its occurrence on both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean should not be considered disjunct based solely on analysis of records of capture. It is more likely that these seemingly isolated records are parts of a continuous distribution pattern that will become more evident over time as additional specimens are observed or collected (Long&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). However, genetic work is urgently required to assess the spatial relationship of the species around the globe.<br/><br/>No nursery areas for the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;have been defined but there is no evidence to suggest that breeding is not widespread. Documented captures have included a mix of neonates, juveniles and adults across most regions, although no pregnant females have been reported (see Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2008). Available records showed that most shallow water observations were of large, adult-sized specimens whereas almost all neonates and small juveniles (&lt;200 cm TL) were caught in depths greater than 300 m (Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2008); these authors suggest that neonatal&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;are either born, or move soon after birth into deeper offshore nursery depths on continental and insular slopes.",Decreasing,"The Smalltooth Sand Tiger is distributed worldwide, and is now reported from more than 30 countries, including numerous offshore and oceanic islands. Records for more than 160 captures and observations were collated and cited by Fergusson <em>et al.</em> (2008), and showed&#160;the&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;to have&#160;an seemingly disjunct distribution across most parts of the world. With additional and more recent records (e.g., Acuña-Marrero <em>et al. </em>2013, Long <em>et al.</em> 2014), the presence of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;has now been established&#160;around the peripheries of all oceans, and at some isolated mid-oceanic insular sites and on submarine ridges and seamounts; the species is also widespread throughout the Mediterranean Sea from where it was first described from France's&#160;Côte d'Azur&#160;by Risso (1810). Overall, the verified latitudinal range&#160;is between 46°N in the Bay of Biscay to around 38–39°S in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; a more recent report of a dead <em>Odontaspis</em> (presumably&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger), washed ashore on the coast of Normandy (western English Channel), possibly extends its northern range to almost 50°N (Ebert and Stehmann 2013).<br/><br/>The following more detailed distributional information is mainly derived from Fergusson <em>et al</em>. (2008) which contains references to most published records; additional references are cited.&#160;In the eastern North Atlantic,&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;has been recorded from the Bay of Biscay (France), Spain, Madeira, Azores, Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013), Morocco, and Western Sahara; its shallow water occurrence at the Canary Islands is now featured on websites as a diver attraction. It is widespread in the Mediterranean Sea where records are from Spain and the Balearic Islands, Algeria, northern Tunisia, Italy, the Pelagic Islands, several countries bordering the Adriatic Sea, Greece and the Aegean Sea, Cyprus, Turkey, and Lebanon; it has also recently been included in the marine fauna of the adjacent coast of Israel (Galil&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Many of the Mediterranean sites apparently favoured by&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;are typically located either along the coasts of islands lying contiguous to deepwater, near offshore seamounts or at mainland localities where continental shelves are narrow, e.g., within the Tyrrhenian Sea, around Sicily, off southwestern Malta, off Lebanon, off the southern coast of Cyprus, and around the Dodecanese and Cyclades island groups of the Aegean Sea. It was first recorded off Lebanon by George&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1964), but reports of&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;being observed by divers near Beirut &#160;(Fergusson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008)<em>&#160;</em>are now believed to be misidentifications of of the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (<em>Hexanchus griseus</em>).&#160;The status of&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;in North African waters of the Mediterranean is patchily known. A small number of specimens are reported and confirmed by preserved dentition from Algerian fisheries and literature and contemporary records for Tunisia are equally sparse. However, specimens are likely still landed at Tunisian ports, from fisheries operating throughout the Sicilian Channel. There are no contemporary data for this species in Libyan or Egyptian waters but it may occur in the slope waters of the southern Levantine Basin.<br/><br/>The species has been recorded from the western North Atlantic Ocean since 1989, with specimens being collected or observed from the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico), North Carolina (USA) and the Florida Straits; in 2004, a 3–4 m Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;was videoed in ~450 m depth on the Viosca Knoll, south of Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico (Sulak 2007). The presence of&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;off Brazil was initially based on jaws collected by fishers off Natal, Rio Grande do Norte but there have been subsequent reports (with photographs) from shallow water around the Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha (Garla and Garcia 2006). In addition,&#160;Long&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2014) cites reports of several longline captures by fishers operating from Santos City, São Paulo State, southern Brazil. There is a one record from the eastern side of the South Atlantic: a specimen was caught in ~400 m during a 1969 trawl survey off the coast of Nigeria (Fishbase 2015).<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean off South Africa,&#160;the&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;was first known from a few juvenile specimens recorded from trawls on the outer edges of the continental shelf off the&#160;KwaZulu Natal coast. In the late 1980s, small numbers were caught on longline gear at about ~300 m along the south KwaZulu Natal coast, and further anecdotal information indicates relatively frequent capture of these sharks (of approx 2 m total length (TL)) during target fishing for deepsea sharks and rays (D. Ebert, pers. comm.).&#160;There have also been unconfirmed, but reliable, reports of sightings by divers of small aggregations of&#160;the&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tiger<em>&#160;</em>around deepwater drop-offs on the Transkei coast in South Africa. To the north, captures have been made off Madagascar, the Chagos Archipelago (Winterbottom and Anderson 1997), the Maldives and Sri Lanka, while divers have observed the species in shallow water at Pemba Island (Tanzania). In the eastern Indian Ocean, divers photographed a large specimen in 15–30 m at Cocos-Keeling Island while, in Indonesia, the species has been observed among landed sharks from demersal longliners operating off southwestern Java and Lombok (White <em>et al</em>. 2006); there is also a single trawl capture from the Northwest Shelf off Western Australia. Captures in oceanic waters of the central and southern Indian Ocean have been over the Melville, South-West Indian, and Ninety-East Ridges.<br/><br/>Across the North Pacific,&#160;the&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;is known from Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al. </em>2013), Japan, at the Kasuga-2 undersea volcano near the Mariana Archipelago (Juniper and Chadwick 2004), the Hawaiian Islands, southern California (USA) and the Gulf of California (Mexico); in 2010, divers reported the species in a kelp forest off southern California (see Elasmodiver 2015). In the eastern equatorial Pacific, the species is a dive attraction at Malpelo Island off Columbia, and the Isla del Cocos off Costa Rica while, in November 2010, a ~400 cm TL specimen was videotaped by divers at Wolf Island in the Galapagos Archipelago providing the first record for that locality (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ritter and Compagno 2013). In February 2013, its southern range in the eastern Pacific was extended by more than 3,000 km to central Chile when a specimen was photographed by a submersible in ~340 m at San Ambrosio Island, about 900 km west of the Chilean mainland (Long <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Most South Pacific records are from western sector around Australia and New Zealand, and islands to their north. There are two records from deepwater research trawls south of New Caledonia and one from a commercial trawl in 883 m (the deepest record) on a seamount on the Louisville Ridge, 600 nautical miles east of New Zealand. There are several records from the east and west coasts of New Zealand's North Island, including a deep-baited video recording of a&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;in 880 m off White Island in the Bay of Plenty (Te Papa 2009); the species is also a diver attraction at the Kermadec Islands to the north. Off southeastern Australia, almost 60 captures (mostly by trawl) are documented from outer-shelf and upper-slope depths (150–850 m) off New South Wales (NSW) and eastern Bass Strait. The only record from the south coast of Australia is a&#160;neonate (102 cm TL) caught in 2005 by trawl in 240 m off South Australia (D. Bray, Museum Victoria, pers. comm.). In 2011–12, three large Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;were caught at the Barcoo and Taupo Seamounts (~200 nautical miles east of Newcastle, NSW) by power handline in depths between 400 and 600 m (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the new records since the review by Fergusson <em>et al</em>. (2008), such as for the Galapagos Island, Chile and the south coast of Australia, add to the seemingly fragmented distribution of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger, they also give support to the contention by Long <em>et al.</em> (2014) that these apparently isolated records are, in reality, parts of a much broader and continuous distribution that will become better defined as more specimens are observed or collected.","Although seldom, if ever, targeted by fishers, the flesh of incidentally caught specimens is used for human consumption, and its very large, oily liver is harvested for its reasonably high squalene content (Compagno 2001). In some areas, the fins of the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;are also taken for the Asian shark-fin trade (Sabogal 2007). In New Zealand, specimens have been captured for display in aquaria; however, survival in captivity has been short. The species has also been featured as a diver attraction in brochures advertising dive-charter operations to the Kermadec Islands, north of New Zealand (Anon. 1993), and also online to publicise diving at locations such as the Canary Islands, Malpelo Island and off Lebanon (e.g. <a href=""www.elasmodiver.com/Smalltooth_Sandtiger_Shark.htm"">www.elasmodiver.com/Smalltooth_Sandtiger_Shark.htm</a>).",Marine,"<strong>In place:</strong><strong><br/></strong>'Deepwater nurse sharks (<em>Odontaspis ferox</em>)' are protected under the New Zealand Wildlife Act 1953 making it illegal to hunt, kill or harm deepwater nurse sharks within New Zealand's territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone; trade in teeth, jaws and fins is also illegal (NZ Dept of Conservation 2015). This protection includes waters around the Kermadec Islands. &#160; &#160;&#160;<strong><br/></strong><br/>Because the numbers of Sand Tiger (Grey Nurse) Sharks (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>) had been seriously depleted&#160;along the New South Wales (NSW) coast of Australia by indiscriminate spearfishing, and by some commercial harvesting, that species was protected in 1984 (Pollard <em>et al.</em> 1996). To avoid any mis-identification or claims of confusion with the similar Smalltooth Sand Tiger, both species were included on the NSW protected species list.&#160;Despite this legal protection, compliance is difficult to enforce and carcasses of juvenile&#160;Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;are sometimes marketed simply as 'shark'. However, even if they or larger adults were returned to the sea intact, these sharks are unlikely to survive the trauma of trawl capture from deepwater. The species is likely to occur in some protected areas of the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network.<br/><br/>Located some 506 km off the coast of Colombia, the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary includes Malpelo island (350 ha) and the surrounding marine environment (857,150 ha). This vast marine park, the largest no-fishing zone in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, provides a critical habitat for internationally threatened marine species, including the Smalltooth Sand Tiger. &#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>At least three countries protect&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;within the Mediterranean Sea. They are Spain (protected off its Mediterranean coast; see Nickel 2012), Malta (Anon. 2013), and Croatia where 'within&#160;waters under Croation jurisdiction, the Smalltooth Sandtiger Shark is proclaimed as a strictly protected species' (http://www.ronjenjehrvatska.com/en/about_croatia/62-ch-0).<span style=""""><br/></span><span style=""""><br/></span><strong style="""">Recommended:</strong><strong><br/></strong>At present this species has not been protected from commercial fishing in any subequatorial African country, due to the fact that it has been observed so rarely and no records have been recorded from any commercial vessel. Development of bycatch mitigation measures such as the use of trawl exclusion devices should be undertaken in relevant fisheries. Although the distribution and status of the population in subequatorial Africa is unknown, the apparent rarity and vulnerability of&#160;the Smalltooth Sand Tiger&#160;means that should any aggregation sites be found, stringent protection would be wise.<br/><br/>Apart from its protection in waters outlined above, there are no specific protection measures in place for the Mediterranean, despite its status there (regionally assessed as Critically Endangered). The protection of favoured coastal habitats and more detailed monitoring of catches within Mediterranean fisheries should be priorities. Conservation of frequented sites as a dive tourism attraction could provide an incentive for local protection, as for well-known Sand Tiger (<em>C. taurus</em>)<em>&#160;</em>habitats in Australia and South Africa. There is now more evidence that coastal locations are frequented by mature Smalltooth Sand Tigers&#160;on a repetitive seasonal basis, possibly for reproduction. Where identified, these sites deserve stringent protection. Community-based dive observations or monitoring at shallow aggregation sites may be of use in obtaining information on its biology and knowledge of important habitats in shallow waters.<br/><br/>Overall, further study is needed to accurately determine the distributional range, abundance and biology (including possible migrations, sex ratios, fecundity, genetic connectivity, etc.) of this species.&#160;Any dead specimens landed by commercial fishing operations should be retained and delivered to the nearest relevant research organisation, so that more biological and genetic information can be obtained.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is caught in artisanal gillnet and longline, purse seine, and industrial shrimp trawl fisheries, which operate throughout most of its range. Where eagle rays have been targeted, fishers have reported declines in catches indicating local depletion. Fisheries are intensive in parts of its range, are noted for overcapacity, recent declines in catch, and poor or no management. This eagle ray may have limited refuge in the Galápagos Marine Reserve, but illegal fishing is ongoing there. Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries operating throughout most of its range and noted declines in catch in some areas, but some refuge in marine parks, the Pacific Eagle Ray is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (43.5 years) based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","This eagle ray inhabits coastal inshore waters in bays and estuaries. It reaches a maximum size of 230 cm DW or 283 cm total length but is usually smaller than 130 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). These rays can be solitary or form large aggregations. Reproduction is viviparous, but little else is known of its biology. The generation length for the Pacific Eagle Ray is suspected to be 14.5 years, close to that of the related Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>), which has an age at maturity of 5 years and a longevity of 24 years (Martin and Cailliet 1988).","Pacific Eagle Rays are caught in artisanal gillnet and longline, purse seine, and industrial shrimp trawl fisheries. In Mexico, gillnetting in the Gulf of California has caused substantial declines in several species such as pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004), and other eagle rays are targeted and caught in this fishery (Ehemann <em>et al. </em>2017). Where eagle rays have been targeted elsewhere, fishers have reported declines in catch (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al. </em>2011). Shrimp trawling is prevalent in Mexico south of the Gulf of California, and management issues such as overcapacity and declining catches have been cited in that fishery (Foster and Vincent 2010). This ray is caught on longlines in Guatemala, where it is now rare (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In El Salvador, this species was formerly not retained but is now being utilized and has become increasingly rare (A. Gonzalez unpubl. data 2019). Gillnets capture them in Costa Rica but they are not retained (M. Espinoza unpubl. data 2019). Data are sparse in Nicaragua and from Panama to Ecuador, but artisanal fisheries in this part of its range are sparsely managed and inadequately enforced&#160;(Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). In the Gulf of Panama, this ray is caught as bycatch in purse seine fishery targeting small pelagic fish (Morales-Saldaña unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In Colombia, this species is mainly caught in small-scale fisheries with gillnets and longlines, as well as in industrial shrimp trawl fisheries, and is consumed or sold locally (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017,&#160;Mejía-Falla <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Overall, Pacific Eagle Rays are caught as bycatch in intensive and inadequately managed fisheries through most of their range, with very little refuge.","Gillnet, trawl, and longline fisheries (both small- and large-scale) capture this species throughout much of its range; these fisheries are intensive in many places along the Eastern Pacific coast, and in most cases management is inadequately enforced or completely lacking. In Mexico, gillnetting in the Gulf of California has caused substantial declines in several species such as pelagic sharks (Sala&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004), and other eagle rays are targeted and caught in this fishery (Ehemann&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017); these are suspected to have also declined. Where eagle rays have been targeted elsewhere, fishers have reported declines in catch (Cuevas-Zimbrón&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;The Pacific Eagle Ray is now considered to be rare in Guatemala (C.

It is benthopelagic at depths of 0–60 m, and possibly to a depth of 90 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple demersal fishing gears, including trawl, gillnet, and set net, and is retained for human consumption or fish meal.<br/><br/>It has undergone a localised population reduction of 81% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) in Ariake Bay, Japan, due to a predator control program. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific time series, although catches of skates and rays from across the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 46–96% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical fishing pressure was high, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent in South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Across its range the species is still considered common and the inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. It is suspected that the Naru Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","The Naru Eagle Ray is benthopelagic and semi-oceanic over the continental shelf from the surface to 60 m depth, and possibly to 90 m depth (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It enters estuarine waters to breed and use as nursery grounds, and in southern Japan, schools move inshore in summer months and move offshore in winter (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005, White <em>et al. </em>2013, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW), males are mature by ~ 80 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is estimated as ~95 cm DW (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous with a litter size of 1<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">–</a>7 embryos reported and a size-at-birth of 33–35 cm DW (White <em>et al.</em> 2013, Last&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 19 years, thus generation length is 12 years (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2005).","<p>The Naru Eagle Ray is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple demersal fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/></p>  <p>In Japan, this species is targeted in a predator control program implemented in Ariake Bay in 2001 to protect commercially important bivalves as the Longnose Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus flagellum</em>)<em>,&#160;</em>and presumably the Naru Eagle Ray, feeds on these bivalves  (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). Up to 10,000 individual eagle rays (which includes this species, Longnose Eagle Ray and the Japanese Eagle Ray<em>,&#160;Myliobatis tobijei</em>) have been targeted in gillnets annually as part of the program. Across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019). In South Korea, the Naru Eagle Ray is occasionally captured (C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). Fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). </p>  <p></p><p></p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. <a name=""_Hlk35497192"">In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of tidal flats since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). </a>In the East China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands (Heileman and Tang 2009). In Viet Nam, large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995).<br/></p>","The Naru Eagle Ray is common in coastal habitats over shallow tidal flats (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). In Japan, this species' abundance has declined by 50% in Ariake Bay over the past 15 years, where it is targeted in a predator control program (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). This represents a decline of 81% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). Prior to the implementation of the program, the population of eagle rays (which also includes the Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis tobie</em>i)), had been increasing in Ariake Bay (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2005). The average maximum size of Naru Eagle Ray individuals in Ariake Bay appears to be decreasing (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019) and in the Seto Inland Sea, research from 2004 to 2012<a name=""_Hlk20403143""></a> found the abundance of larger Naru Eagle Rays (&gt;120 cm disc width) decreased after 2008 (Shimamoto<em> et al.</em> 2019).    <p><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">In Japan, the catch of all skates and rays combined from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</a></p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea, China, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson<em> et al.</em> 2013).</a></p>  <p></p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (36 years), they represent declines of 75%, 94%, 46%, and 96% in&#160;Japan, South Korea, China, and Viet Nam respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Significant localised depletion of the Naru Eagle Ray in Ariake Bay is evident with a population reduction of 84% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to the predator control program. Historical fishing pressure was high across the spatial and depth range of the Naru Eagle Ray, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Across its range the species is still considered common and the inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. Overall, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Naru Eagle Ray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean where it occurs from Japan to Viet Nam, including North and South Korea, and China (White <em>et al. </em>2013, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","<p>The meat is used for human consumption and fish meal.

In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial bottom trawling in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Further research is needed on population size and trends, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.  </p>","",,false,false,Global

R</span>ecent changes to the taxonomy of this species, and reporting of the species under different names (e.g., Cow Stingray, <em>Dasyatis ushiei</em> or Black Stingray, <em>D.&#160;thetidis</em><em></em>) may have precluded its accurate identification in the past. Little data are available to determine population trends although the very large size of the Brown Stingray makes it intrinsically susceptible to population depletion. There is no reason to infer or suspect a reduction in population size across its range in Australia, New Zealand, or the United States given the levels of fishing effort across its known range in these countries. However, there are largely unmanaged fisheries that operate across the remaining regions where it has been recorded (e.g., West Africa, India, and Indonesia) and the intense fishing pressure is a cause of concern. While declines in rays have been noted in these regions, this species also occurs deeper than most stingrays and this may offer it some refuge from fishing in deeper waters. Overall, i<span style="""">t is suspected that the Brown Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (65 years)&#160;due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</span>","<span style="""">The Brown Stingray is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates and&#160;sometimes around coral reefs on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0</span><span style=""""><span style="""">–</span>800 m (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b).

Following two centuries of fisheries development, target shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2008).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal&#160;(Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades and reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.&#160;</em><span style="""">2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­ to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010 - these were mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch (Walker&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2018). Furthermore,</span><span style="""">&#160;China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">the reported legal catch by&#160;</span><span style="""">more than 40% (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p>In Pakistan, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). In India, there are intense coastal fisheries with a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years. For example, about 6,600 trawlers were operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, there is a targeted fishery for rays that began two years ago and consists of 20–40 boats and catch up to 6 tonnes of rays per trip (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 14 April 2020). In Thailand, most&#160;fisheries are overexploited.&#160;Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with batoid contribution to rising catches. Batoids comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings in 2003, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).","<span style="""">There are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally (e.g., Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Watson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013,&#160;Belhabib<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018).<br/></span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style="""">First, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Brown Stingray is considered rare with few records over the last few decades (</span>Capapé 1993, Serena<span style="""">&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).

Analysis of various&#160;trawl datasets from the Adriatic Sea between 1948 and 2005&#160;</span>indicate that only four individuals were captured (Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2013). The Italian survey program Gruppo Nazionale Risorse Demersali (GRUND) carried out over 22 surveys in Italian waters between 198 and 1998. The percentage presence of this species was one of the lowest recorded (0.83%) and it was only captured in the South Ligurian Sea and Sardinian waters (Relin<span style="""">i <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Off&#160;the coast of Turkey, this species is considered rare with only five surveys having recorded fewer than five individuals each between 2000 and 2017 in&#160;Iskenderun&#160;Bay, the Gulf of Antalya, and the Aegean Sea (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2017).

Population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but do indicate rising fishing pressure.&#160;Since the 1970s, the greatest African fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries were located in Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). Across West Africa,&#160;</span><span style="""">the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) decreased by 71% between 1970 and 2015 from 0.68 t/kW (tons per kilowatts) to 0.20 t/kw (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Simultaneously,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">the average elasmobranch landings increased by more than 2.5 times from 1970 to 2015 (Pauly&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2020), implying an increase in fishing effort. Within countries, landings have begun to decline&#160;in recent years. For example, in</span><span style="""">&#160;Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased from 1950 to 1972 then declined by 80% from 1972 to 1981. Landings increased again until 2001 followed by a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline from 2001 to 2016. These declines in landings can be inferred to represent&#160;population reductions as the fishing effort has remained stable during</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""> the decline (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).

The industrial elasmobranch CPUE of the region more than doubled during this time frame (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).

In Pakistan, while this species is considered rare, there has been a change in area of operation of fish trawlers from less than 40 m depth to about 150 m on the continental shelf area which has increased the frequency of landings for this species (Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 26 January 2021).&#160;In India, one individual (as Roughtail Stingray) was reported from exploratory trawl surveys undertaken in 1972 off Quilon, west coast of India at a depth of 250 m (Silas and Selvaraj 1985).

However, if this species does occur in India, although rarely reported,<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing.&#160;The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990</span> and 2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">In Thailand, nine individuals were recorded during landing site surveys&#160;undertaken in 2013–2014 (BOBLME 2014). There are no species-specific ray landings data but data are available on all combined ray species from the Thailand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</span>Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in eight years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;</span><span style=""""><br/><br/>Sixth, in Southeast Asia, catches of sharks and&#160;rays are very high but are declining and fishers are traveling much further from port to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl&#160;fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and&#160;elsewhere are extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;While species-specific data on long-term declines in sharks and rays in&#160;the Southeast Asia region are lacking, declines of the Brown Stingray in this region and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2006). For example, the catch of&#160;whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998–2014 from 300 t to an estimated 167 t (Zeller and Pauly 2016). </span>In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in western Sumatra and Java; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi pers. comm. 14 April 2020). Research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort.&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">In Taiwan, this species is only&#160;occasionally observed at fish markets (Ebert</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2013).

The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993 to 2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu pers. comm. Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics 2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993 to 2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H.

Between 2008 and 2013, 32.9 t of the species was reported from commercial fisheries (Francis 2015). The species was ranked with&#160;relatively high risk from current fishing activities, but it also exists at depths of &lt;100 m where many commercial fisheries closures exist (Ford<em> et al.</em> 2018). The species is listed as Not Threatened by the New Zealand Threat Classification System (NZTCS) (Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2018) and was regionally assessed as Least Concern using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Finucci <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Eighth, in the United States, this species is considered common in nearshore waters of Hawaii and is the most common species in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu (Cartamil&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002). There are no commercial or recreational fisheries for this species (Dale and Holland 2012).<br/></p><p>The Brown Stingray has a patchy distribution and little data are available to determine population trends. There is no reason to infer or suspect a reduction in population size across its range in Australia, New Zealand, or the United States given distribution overlap with/or the levels of fishing effort. However, there are largely unmanaged fisheries that operate across the remaining regions where it has been recorded (e.g., West Africa, India, and Indonesia) and the intense fishing pressure is a cause of concern. While declines in rays have been noted in these regions, this species is likely to have some refuge at depth. Overall, i<span style="""">t is suspected that the Brown Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (65 years)&#160;due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</span></p>",Decreasing,"The Brown Stingray is found in the Mediterranean Sea (but absent from the Black Sea), east Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, the west Pacific, and Eastern Central Pacific Ocean (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016b). It has a widespread but patchy distribution and recent changes to the taxonomy of this species, and its reporting under different names (e.g., Cow Stingray or Black Stingray) may have precluded its accurate identification in the past. Furthermore, many records of this species are old and require verification.","The Brown Stingray is used for its meat. While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh in many coastal communities across its range as an important source of protein (e.g., Eastern Central Atlantic region: Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005; India: K. K. Bineesh pers. comm. 07 February 2017).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species.&#160;Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Brown Stingray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts its range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future.&#160;<p><span lang=""EN-US"">In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure, and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).</p>Oman has banned trawling in its waters since 2011 and India has a seasonal trawl ban that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches are likely to occur in other fisheries (e.g., gillnetting). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnage are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).<p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1987). There are currently plans in place to lift both this ban in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi pers. comm. 14 April 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020).</p><p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Australia, the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and other bycatch reduction devices has significantly reduced the bycatch of rays, especially for large individuals with &gt;100 cm total length such as the Brown Whipray (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2004). State and Commonwealth marine protected areas may provide some refuge for this species. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 0–100 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption and possibly fish meal. Landings of this species in some areas have appeared stable in China over the past 10 years, although concurrent effort data for those areas is lacking. The catch-per-unit effort of all rays has remained stable in Taiwan over 17 years, and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the Japan, China, and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 46–85% over the past three generation lengths (26 years). Historic and current fishing pressure are high across most of the species’ range, yet is likely to have a stable population in Taiwan over 17 years (two generation lengths) which indicates that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure, possibly due to a short generation length. Fishing pressure has been in decline in Japan over the past three generation lengths (26 years). Dramatic levels of habitat loss across its China range is a threat to the species. It is suspected that the Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 0–100 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016a, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~29 cm disc width (DW) (~80 cm total length), male and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Reproduction is oviparous with litter sizes of 1–3 and size-at-birth of ~8 cm DW (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the related and similar-sized Plain Maskray (<em>Neotrygon annotata</em>)  that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 4 years and a maximum  age of 13 years, resulting in a generation length of 8.5 years (Jacobsen  and Bennett 2010).","<p>The Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption and possibly fish meal.</p>  <p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22884618""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a).</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). </p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s and 65% loss of tidal flats (one type of intertidal habitat) since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).&#160;</a></p>","<p> In China, the observed species abundance at some fish markets has remained stable over the past 10 years, although trends prior to that are unknown (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Fishing pressure has increased in China over the past decade and the lack of change in landings may indicate a decline in catch rates, however there is no concurrent effort data at the area of the fish markets to infer population trends. In Taiwan, although  there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all  rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu,  Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). </p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan, China, and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. <br/></p><p>In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p><p> In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</a></p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray (26 years), they represent declines of 84%, 46%, and 85% in Japan, China, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.</p>  <p>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the spatial and depth range of the Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray. Yet, a stable population is reported from Taiwan over 17 years (two generation lengths). This indicates that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. Fishing pressure has been in decline in Japan over the past three generation lengths. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may afford the species some refuge. Overall, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Pale-edge Sharpnose Stingray is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific from southern Japan to Viet Nam, including China and Taiwan; the presence of the species in Thailand and the Philippines is uncertain (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).","This species is used for human consumption and possibly fish meal.

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/></a></p>  <p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019).

It is also recently reported from east India. The species is demersal on the continental shelf in rocky, coral, and soft-sediment habitats at depths of 25–36 m. An isolated, entirely freshwater population occurs in the Zuojiang River, China. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption. The freshwater population, which is subject to commercial fishing pressure, is suspected to have declined by 80–90% over the past 20 years. There are no species-specific time-series from elsewhere, although catch-per-unit effort of all rays has remained stable in Taiwan over 17 years, and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Malaysia  Exclusive Economic Zones, and catch rates in Indonesia and India indicate declines of 46%–99% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). Historic and current fishing pressure are high across the species’ entire range, yet in China and Taiwan this is an abundant and common species with a stable population in Taiwan, which suggests that the species has some resilience to fishing pressure and it may have refuge in rocky habitat. It is suspected that Bennett's Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>Bennett's Stingray is demersal across rocky, coral, and soft-sediment habitats, and occurs inshore on the continental shelf at depths of 25–36 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, Weigmann 2016, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In China, a local population occurs entirely in freshwater in the Zuojiang River, more than 1,500 km inland (Zhang <em>et al. </em>2010). The inland population is isolated from the South China Sea due to dams in the Pearl River Basin, and is breeding in the freshwater habitat (Zhang <em>et al. </em>2010). The species reaches a maximum size of 61 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~32 cm DW with female size-at-maturity unknown. Reproduction is viviparous and size-at-birth is ~13 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the related Kuhl's Maskray (<em>Neotrygon kuhlii</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 6.5 years and a maximum age of 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).<br/></p>","<p>Bennett's Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, likely including trawl, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption. The freshwater population in the <a name=""_Hlk24460796"">Zuojiang River is subject to commercial fishing pressure (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of Bennett's Stingray.</a><br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956–2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019). <br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore and occur across all habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, and estuaries. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. By 2007, over 40% of the trawler catch in the Gulf of Thailand consisted of small, low-value fish (Derrick <em>et al. </em>2017). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s  with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries  in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive  and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and  stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude  (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al.</em>  2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the  world with batoid contribution to rising catches. Batoids comprised over  50% of chondrichthyan landings in 2003, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). </p><p></p>  <p> </p><p></p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series for Bennett's Stingray. In China, the isolated freshwater population is now rare with less than 20 individuals captured annually (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Based on anecdotal information, it is suspected that this isolated population has declined by 80–90% over the past 20 years (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Elsewhere in China, this is species is abundant and common with small to large individuals noted at fish markets; anecdotally there is a slight decrease in landings in the past 10 years (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In Taiwan, this species is considered very common (H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). Although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years (1997–2013) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Landings data are available on all combined ray species from the Thailand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Malaysia EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Cambodia, the reconstructed catch data showed a 91% reduction decline  in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches sharply rose from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014  (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in populations of sharks, rays, and skates in both countries can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh<em> et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed catch data showed declines in landings of sharks, rays, and skates. On the east coast, there was a 30% decline from a peak of 17,604 t in 1999 to 12,314 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). On the west coast, the decline was 54% decline from a peak of 19,308 t in 1979 to 8,902 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s on both coasts and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in Peninsular Malaysia. In Indonesia, research survey data shows an ~ 50% decline in ray  catch-per-unit effort 1976–1997 throughout the Java Sea in the areas of  the Bennett's Stingray distribution (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). In India, there is no information on ray catches from the east coast,  however, the annual average catch rate of demersal rays landed by   trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 declined by 63%,  despite a doubling of trawl effort (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This  provides an indication of overall batoid declines as a result of heavy  (and increasing) fishing pressure on the Indian continental shelf. <br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of Bennett's Stingray (36 years), they represent declines of 46%, 99%, 99%, 58%, 55%, 70%, and 92% in China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, east and west coast Peninsular Malaysia, Indonesia, and India, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. A population trend cannot be inferred for Thailand. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of  exploitation’) is high across the spatial and depth range of Bennett's  Stingray. The isolated freshwater population in China is suspected to  have undergone dramatic declines of 80–90% over the past 20 years. The  inshore distribution provides little refuge from fishing pressure, yet  in China and Taiwan this is an abundant and common species, which  suggests that it has some resilience to fishing pressure. The  inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may afford the  species some refuge. Overall, the species is suspected to have undergone  a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths  (36 years).</p>",Decreasing,"Bennett's Stingray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans from northern China to Java, Indonesia, including Taiwan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia (Zhu and Meng 2001, Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). A single specimen has recently been reported on the east coast of India (Muktha <em>et al.</em> 2019). Records from Bangladesh (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014) require further verification.","This species is used for human consumption, and is retained live for sale in China to increase the market value (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">No specific measures are in place. </a><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">The freshwater population in China is highly threatened and a cessation to commercial fishing and a designated protected area are recommended for the Zuojiang River population  (Zhang <em>et al. </em>2010). Elsewhere in China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East China Sea and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).</a><br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (GT) (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). The species may receive some protection in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which cover  ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with  no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6%  of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 GT are  prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF  2015). Research is required on the species' life history, population size and trends, and catch rates should be monitored.   </p>  <p>  </p><p></p><p>  </p>","",,false,false,Global

Furthermore, there&#160;is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species which are a cause for concern.<br/><br/>Overall, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries as well as aggregating behaviour, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Daisy Whipray&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (32 years)&#160;due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.

Its aggregating behaviour makes it particularly susceptible to various fisheries (Gulyugin <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style="""">In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;</span>et al.&#160;<span style="""">2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

However, although larger than its regional congener the Pearl Whipray (<em>Fontitrygon margaritella</em>), it is important to note that these species are still confused and records are likely to be aggregated. This species was only recorded in Guinea during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). Yet, in Senegal, this species is now sometimes recorded in artisanal fisheries landings along the coast (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). There, while rays are now commonly marketed, several ray species were likely to be discarded in the past due to their low commercial value but have now become utilized bycatch (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, in The Gambia, previously unused ray species have recently become commercially targeted in response to a declining shark fishery (Moore et al. 2019). Yet, during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018, this species was only recorded in small numbers (12 individuals) compared to the Pearl Whipray (thousands of individuals) (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, it is sometimes recorded in both artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries, but it is less common than the Pearl Whipray (M. Dia, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In recent environmental DNA surveys across the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau, this species was not detected in water samples but confirmed from market surveys, although in smaller quantities than the Pearl Whipray (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that this species represented 4.2% of catches with up to 16.1 kg captured in each 30 min set between 1983–1984 (Lhomme 1985). Landing site surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 3% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Nigeria, although quantities are not available, and it is likely that the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray data are aggregated, they are very commonly captured in industrial trawl fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). It has not been detected in recent surveys in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species along with other dasyatids (Brown Stingray (<em>Bathytoshia lata</em>), Marbled Stingray (<em>Dasyatis marmorata</em>), Common Stingray (<em>D. pastinaca</em>), Pearl Whipray, and Round Stingray (<em>Taeniurops grabatus</em>)) were considered common and represented 18.5% of rays captured in 2018 (99.9% mortality rate) and 26.5% in 2019 (100% mortality rate) (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). Overall, dasyatids in trawl fisheries represented 4.6% of trawl production in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. This species was also recorded throughout the year from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and represented 1% of ray landings (E. Chartrain and G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to 18 individuals representing 4.77% of catches recorded in Ghana and Gabon (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Republic of the Congo, this species was the most commonly recorded ray with 1,128 records representing 4% of landings during surveys undertaken between January and December 2019, although some of these records might include the Pearl Whipray (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, landings of the Pearl Whipray and Daisy Whipray represented up to 70% of all shark and ray records over two years of landing site surveys between 2018–2019 (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). However, based on sizes of specimens landed (&gt;34 cm DW), the Daisy Whipray is likely to be the most common species recorded there. Similarly, this species represented 7% of all sharks and rays reported through a citizen science network set up in Cameroon between 2019–2020 (A. Takoukam Kamla pers. comm. 7 July 2020). In Angola, five individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker </span></span><em>et al</em><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, even though this species is still landed in several countries across its range, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries as well as aggregating behaviour, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Daisy Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (32 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation. It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2d.<br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Daisy Whipray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Mauritania to Angola (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b; R.W.

While little-species specific information is available, the meat of rays is consumed fresh across many coastal communities in the region as an important source of protein (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). It is also salted-dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, it is sometimes used as animal feed (e.g., for chickens in Ghana; I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Daisy Whipray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure, and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;The gill and tanglenet fishery, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/02/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p></p><p>In Malaysia, this species is very common in Peninsular Malaysia and caught by trawls and demersal gillnets (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply in Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).</p><p>The Dwarf Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam EEZ. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, lift net, longline, push net, and traps, and it is retained for human consumption or for fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nm from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is one of the most commonly landed elasmobranchs (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).","<p>This species is the most commonly landed small ray throughout Peninsular  Malaysia and Indonesia (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). There is no species-specific population trend data for this species but despite this,  reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Dwarf Whipray (26 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 59–84%.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ, specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’); and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Dwarf Whiprays in Indonesia is 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 97% when scaled to three generation lengths (26 years) (Krajangdara 2019). There is a large amount of Illegal, Unerported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Dwarf Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Dwarf Whipray has undergone a 30–49% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (26 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Dwarf Whipray&#160;is found in the coastal waters of the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific from Vietnam to southern Myanmar (Last <em>et al. </em>2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016b).",The flesh of the Dwarf Whipray is used fresh for meat. Excess flesh is salted and dried for human consumption (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010b).,Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 marine protected areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p></p><p>In Viet Nam There is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>","",,false,false,Global
104219816,161615,Pateobatis fai,Vulnerable,A2bd,2016,2015-02-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This is an amended version of the 2015 assessment to accommodate the change in genus name from <em>Himatura </em>to <em>Pateobatis</em>.<br/><br/>The Pink Whipray (<em>Pateobatis </em><em>fai</em>) has a wide, but poorly defined range throughout the Indo-West Pacific. It is frequently misidentified as <em>P. jenkinsii,&#160;</em>which can complicate species-specific catch data<em>.</em>&#160;It is taken as a utilised bycatch of tangle/gillnet, trawl net, and dropline fisheries throughout Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean. Inshore fishing pressure is intense throughout this species' range in Southeast Asia and in parts of the Indian Ocean. It is caught in particularly high numbers in the target fishery for rhynchobatids operating in the Arafura Sea. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of sharks and rays are reported to be declining, with fishermen having to travel further to sustain catch levels. Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is commonly caught&#160;in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays, the level of decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations)&#160;and&#160;exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, as well as from habitat loss.<br/><br/>In Australia,&#160;the Pink Whipray is considered at minimal threat throughout its wide range as there is no information to suggest that this species has declined in this area.&#160;Fisheries in northern Australia are generally well managed and the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) have significantly reduced the bycatch of large stingrays. There are also marine protected areas in this species' range, and this species is common in parts of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. This large species may have limiting life history characteristics that would make it biologically susceptible to depletion in fisheries and therefore, efforts should be made to assess and monitor mortality in fisheries and population trends throughout its range. The Pink Whipray is assessed as Vulnerable globally based on inferred levels of decline and exploitation across a large part of its range, but is considered to be Least Concern in Australia.","The Pink Whipray is found on soft substrates on the inner continental shelf, from the intertidal zone to at least 200 m depth (Last and Stevens 2009). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Males reach maturity at 108-122 cm disc width (DW), but size at maturity for females is unknown (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009). Maximum size is at least 186 cm DW and size at birth is reported at 30-55 cm DW (Manjaji 2004, White <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160;Gutteridge 2012). Little is known of its biology. A generation length of 20 years can be estimated based on the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Himantura astra</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacobsen and Bennett 2011), but noting that the Blackspotted Whipray&#160;grows to a much smaller maximum size (80 cm disc width) than the Pink Whipray (186 cm DW).<br/><br/>Aggregations have been observed on atolls of the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef (Last and Stevens 2009); it has been observed aggregating in groups of up to 25 individuals within sandy coral reef and inshore habitats (Vaudo and Heithaus 2009). Tracking data indicates that such aggregations are likely seasonal, with more frequent aggregations known during warmer months (Vaudo and Heithaus 2012). The species has also been observed ""catching a ride"" on other large bodied ray species (in Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia) (W. White, pers. obs., 2007).","The inshore fishing pressure for the Pink Whipray is high throughout much of its range in Southeast Asia. In this area, most bycatch by commercial fisheries (especially trawlers) are landed and sold as food fish.&#160;In Indonesia,&#160;and probably throughout other areas of its range, this species is captured by demersal tangle net, bottom trawl, commercial gillnet and, to a lesser extent, longline fisheries&#160;(White <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>The Pink Whipray and other stingrays are an important retained bycatch of the commercial gillnet fishery in Indonesia that targets rhynchobatid rays in the Arafura Sea (Last and Compagno 1999; W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Catches in inshore waters have declined and these vessels are having to travel farther to sustain catches; the rhynchobatid fisheries are very intensive in this region, thus the level of exploitation is extremely high.<br/><br/>Within Borneo, the species is an occasional capture in the demersal tangle net and bottom trawl fisheries (Last <em>et al. </em>2010), and it has been observed from fish market surveys within Thailand (Krajangdara 2014). Given that this species occurs in shallow, nearshore environments, ongoing and widespread degradation of coral reefs and coastal areas throughout south-east Asia are likely contributing to declines in the region.<br/><br/>In Sabah (Malaysia), Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia, <em>Himantura</em> species are often caught and landed in the inshore fisheries (trawls and longlines) and are also taken by Danish seine fishing gear (M. Manjaji-Matsumoto and Fahmi, pers. obs. 2007; W. White, pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>Within the prawn trawl fleet that operates in the Gulf of Papua in Southern Papua New Guinea, the Pink Whipray<em>&#160;</em>is captured in low numbers, as bycatch reduction gear are not currently in place for the fishery (L. Baje, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In Australia, catch data for this species is relatively limited, though large specimens were previously reported as bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery. However, with the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and other bycatch reduction devices in the fishery, the ray bycatch has declined by 36.6% and there has been significant reductions in the catch and associated mortality of the Pink Whipray&#160;(Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>This species may be more vulnerable to depletion given its large size at maturity and maximum size compared to other&#160;<em>Himantura&#160;</em>species (Manjaji-Matsumoto and Fahmi, pers. obs. 2007).","This species is common but not abundant in some areas in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines (M. Manjaji-Matsumoto, Famhi and B. Samiengo, pers. obs. 2007). It can be relatively common in reef sand adjacent areas along northern Australia, (W. White, pers. obs., 2007), including in areas of the Great Barrier Reef.<br/><br/>Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Pink Whipray in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"The Pink Whipray has a likely widespread, but poorly defined range in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans from southern Africa to Micronesia (White <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Last and Stevens 2009).<br/><ul><li><strong>Indian Ocean: </strong><em>Western Indian Ocean</em>: South Africa (Last and Compagno 1999); Suez, Egypt (R.

The presence of marine protected areas within Australian coastal waters, such as Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP)&#160;and Shark Bay Marine Reserve, has reduced the potential for this species to be captured, and it is very common in parts of the GBRMP.<br/><br/>In the Maldives,&#160;15 popular dive sites were declared marine protected areas in 1995 with further protective measures under consideration (Anderson and Hafiz 1997). The Pink Whipray&#160;is one of the species that is fed daily at a popular dive site.

It is known from a limited number of specimens collected from four locations along an ~900 km stretch of Somali coastline. It occurs on continental and insular shelves at depths of 29-91 m. Its entire distribution has been subject to at least four decades of unregulated commercial benthic trawling; shelf-occurring catsharks are very susceptible to capture in this fishing gear. The new Somali Fisheries Law bans benthic trawling, but it is suspected that past declines have already occurred given the long history of unregulated fishing across its entire range. Furthermore, enforcement of this new regulation will be a challenge. While specific data are lacking, a population size reduction of 30-50% is suspected over the past three generations (~45 years) based on actual levels of exploitation (bycatch) and the species is assessed as Vulnerable A2d. It is of concern that there have been no records since 1991, although it is acknowledged that research and monitoring have been limited in Somalia.&#160;Further investigation of this species is required to accurately define its range, biology, extent of catches in local fisheries and levels of declines. This assessment should be revisited as soon as this is available.","The Speckled Catshark occurs on continental and insular shelves at depths of 29-91 m, and reaches 48 cm total length.

Somali waters have been subjected to intense unregulated commercial benthic trawling for at least four decades, with a long history of foreign trawl fisheries operating across the entire range of the Speckled Catshark (Glaser <em>et al.</em> 2015). While the new Somali Fisheries Law now bans benthic trawling, decades of unregulated trawling may have already caused population-level impacts on this species, and implementation of regulations and enforcement remain a challenge (Glaser<em> et al.</em> 2015). Given the small size of the species, it is unlikely to be taken in longline fisheries, but may interact with small-meshed gillnet fisheries which are used by artisanal fisheries in the region and demersal trawls from illegal fishing by foreign vessels.","To date there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for this species. Further research is needed to determine population size and trends in abundance. Significant declines in commercially important demersal fish species have been reported from where it occurs and areas surrounding it (Gulf of Aden and Red Sea), with many now considered overexploited (De Young 2006). Similarly, reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, Yemen (including the Socotra Archipelago) and Somalia were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002, Glaser <em>et al. </em>2015).

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters at depths of 3–55 m. Smaller whiprays have relatively high biological productivity and the Bengal Whipray has an inferred generation length of 8.5 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally.<br/><br/>There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia can be used to infer declines of 59–84% over the past three generation lengths (26 years). In Bangladesh and Thailand, this species is one of the most common rays landed but has had steep declines in the past 10 years. Its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in declines, however, its productivity likely reduces the impact of fishing.

Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. This species is among one of the most frequently landed rays in Myanmar (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth&#160;(A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many fishing vessels in the southwest regions of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juvenile rays are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years.<span class=""tlid-translation""> A ray fishery has recently begun (2 years) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses demersal set gillnets to catch up to 6 t of rays per trip (3-5 days). There are currently 20–40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).<br/></p>","<p>There is no population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data,  reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are three lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Bengal Whipray (26 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 59–84%.</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. This species is among the top three ray species landed in Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 97% when scaled to three generation lengths (26 years) (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, this is a commonly landed ray and questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years, particularly smaller rays like the Bengal Whipray (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Although this species appears in landings in India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in rays from intense and increasing fishing. The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The Bengal Whipray averaged 8% of trawl captured in weight but trends in landings across years was not available (Kizhakudan <em>et al. </em>2010). These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense. Trawl fisheries have expanded rapidly since then (K. V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 07/02/2017). <br/></p><p>There is a large amount of IUU in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Bengal Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Bengal Whipray has undergone a 30–49% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (26 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Bengal Whipray occurs in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from eastern India to Sarawak, Malaysia (Last&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016b, Krajangdara, 2019, Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).","<p>The flesh of the Bengal Whipray is used fresh for meat. Excess flesh is salted and dried for human consumption and is sometimes exported (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In Bangladesh, smaller rays are dried whole and sold in local stores (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In India, the skin is often processed and used for leather (R. W. Jabado pers. comm. 22/04/2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place.&#160;In Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species. The CMFRI recommend a minimum legal size for capture of 14 cm disc width for this species, however, this is not enforced (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.</p>","",,false,false,Global

There are no data on the relative sizes of the various subpopulations, and thus the proportion of each of their contributions to the global population is unknown.<br/><br/>The overall range in natural mortality is variable (0.34-1.3 year<sup>-1</sup>). Using a longevity of 14 years and age at first maturity of two years, its estimated generation length is 5-8 years. The species is targeted by large commercial and recreational sectors in most of its subpopulations. It also occurs as bycatch in purse seine fisheries that target smaller, schooling pelagic fishes.

Where management and regulations are adequate, the subpopulation can rebound: for example, while biomass in the U.S. Atlantic remains below historical levels, it has exhibited reversal of this declining trend in recent years. Furthermore, the subpopulations in the Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia appear to be stable and are not currently under threat from overexploitation. Very little is known on the status of its two subpopulations in the northern Indian Ocean and these would be considered Data Deficient by Red List standards.<br/><br/>As this species is relatively fast-growing with a high fecundity and recent estimates of natural mortality exceed those previously calculated, it has a high likelihood for recovery given reductions in fishing effort.

It is a voracious visual feeder renowned for its appetite where it often feeds on atherinids and engraulids, but also other teleosts and squid (Buckel 1999). Younger individuals hunt in schools, and the adults in loose groups. Sharks, tunas and billfishes prey on <em>P. saltatrix</em> and it is a major prey item for the Shortfin Mako Shark and Swordfish (Stillwell and Kohler 1982, 1985).<br/><br/>The species is typically found at temperatures ranging from 14-16°C to 30°C. Although there are variations in life history traits among populations, there are commonalities: adults migrate to spawning grounds, eggs and larvae are typically transported along-shore to juvenile nursery habitats, juveniles recruit to coastal areas and estuaries, grow rapidly and are mainly piscivorous (Juanes <em>et al</em>. 1996). The spawning, seasonal migration, and life cycle are closely linked to temperature. Spawning occurs in surface waters of temperatures ranging from 20-26.8°C (Norcross <em>et al</em>. 1974, Kendall and Walford 1979, Ditty and Shaw 1995, Juanes <em>et al</em>. 1996). It is a multiple batch spawner with intermediate fecundity that spawns large numbers of small eggs continuously during the spring migration (Salekhova 1959, Deuel <em>et al</em>. 1966).<br/><br/>Its maximum age is 14 years (Sipe and Chittenden 2002). Female age at first maturity is ~1.9 years at a size of 48 cm total length (Robillard <em>et al</em>. 2008). Juveniles remain oceanic for an additional 15 to 45 days after flexion before recruiting to nearshore habitats (Nyman and Conover 1988, McBride and Conover 1991). This species can grow to nearly one-third of its maximum length within its first year (Richards 1976, Wilk 1977). Survival of larvae is associated with size and growth rate; those that are larger at age one tend to be larger and faster growing throughout the larval stage (Hare and Cowen 1997). Its maximum size is 130 cm total length (Randall 1995). The IGFA all-tackle gamefish record is 14.40 kg.<br/>Natural mortality: in Turkey 0.60-0.90 year<sup>-1</sup> (Akyol and Ceyhan 2007, Cengiz <em>et al</em>. 2013); in Oman 0.57 year<sup>-1</sup> (Chesalin <em>et al</em>. 2012); in Western Australia 0.34-0.42 year<sup>-1</sup> (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013); in Eastern Australia 0.8-1.3 year<sup>-1</sup> (Leigh and O'Neill 2004). Over five different studies, the overall range in natural mortality is 0.34-1.3 year<sup>-1</sup>.<br/><br/><strong><em>Regional migratory behaviour</em></strong>: This species is highly migratory along the U.S. Atlantic coast and seasonally moves between the U.S. south Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic, travelling as far north as Maine in the spring and summer months and to Florida in the winter (Wilk 1977, Fahay <em>et al</em>. 1999, Shepard et al. 2005, Shepard and Nieland 2010). Spawning occurs in the U.S. South Atlantic Bight from March to May, September to November, and May to August (Collins and Stender 1987, Hare and Cowen 1993). Spring/summer spawned young of the year migrate from estuaries to continental shelf waters of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Bight in early fall, while adults are found over the continental shelf throughout summer and fall (Buckel <em>et al</em>. 1998). Spawning in the Gulf of Mexico may occur in April and in October-November (Ditty and Shaw 1995), and larvae are rare in the eastern Gulf. It has been noted to spawn off south Texas (Finucane <em>et al</em>. 1978). Off Brazil, it spawns mainly during the winter (south of 32°S) and migrates from south to north throughout the year (Muelbert and Sinque 1996, Silvano and Begossi 2010). Juveniles recruit to estuaries in Brazil south of Rio Grande and in northern Argentina (Perier 1995). In the Mediterranean, adults overwinter primarily in the sea of Marmara and Aegean Sea, and migrate through the Bosporus Strait into the Black Sea in spring (Turgan 1959, Gordina and Klimova 1996). Spawning in the Mediterranean occurs in spring and summer (Tortonese 1984), probably along the north-western coast on the middle shelf (Sabates and Martin 1993) and recruits to coastal areas in Bulgaria and Romania in the late summer (Porumb 1971). Off northwestern Africa, major spawning grounds are found in frontal zones off southern Mauritania (17°N to 22°N) from May to July (Conand and Franqueville 1973, Conand 1975, 1976, Champagnat 1983). A second spawning may have occurred off northern Senegal in October and November (Champagnat 1983); however, this activity is likely to be greatly diminished or no longer occurring due to the effects of overexploitation (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles recruit to estuaries in southern Senegal, Gambia and northern Guinea (12°N to 15°N) between December to January and August to September (Champagnat 1983). In eastern South Africa, adults migrate northwards to KwaZulu-Natal in the winter. It spawns north of 31°S (off Durban) in the austral spring and summer (October to March) (van der Elst 1976). Juveniles recruit to coastal bays and, to a lesser extent, to estuaries south of the spawning grounds from December to March (van der Elst 1976). Off western Australia, spawning occurs in spring (October-November), and autumn (March-April), with spring spawning occurring in the central portion of the range, and autumn spawning in the southern portion. Juvenile nursery habitats include coastal/estuaries along the southern west coast. In eastern Australia, adults migrate northwards to spawn in spring and summer in the northern portion of the range and juveniles utilize nursery habitats in both the northern and southern portions from December to February and June to August (Bade 1977, Blaber and Blaber 1980, Morton et al. 1993, Zeller et al. 1996). <br/><br/><strong><em>Generation Length</em></strong>: <br/>The equation used here to calculate generation length is: <br/><br/>Generation Length = Age of first reproduction + (z * Length of the reproductive period)<br/>where Length of the reproductive period = Longevity - Age of first reproduction<br/><br/>Longevity = 14; age at first reproduction = 2; z = 0.5; therefore, generation length = 2 + [0.5*(14 - 2)] = 8 years<br/><br/>Based on an age of first maturity of 2 years, and longevity of 14 years, generation length is conservatively estimated at about 8 years. The value for z is inferred as 0.5 because the fecundity of this species increases with age and data necessary to calculate z are not available. Considering the assumption made with z, we therefore chose to use a range of generation lengths of 5-8 years with 8 years likely being a high estimate of the actual duration. Therefore, three generation lengths = 15-24 years.<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","Overfishing is occurring in many of the approximately 8-10 geographically isolated subpopulations of this species (i.e., the Mediterranean, northwestern Africa, southwestern Atlantic, eastern Australia, and southern Africa). It forms predictable congregations of spawning and post-spawning adults, which increases its susceptibility to rapid depletion by heavy fishing activity (Govender 1996, Hoyle <em>et al</em>. 2000, Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012). While it is explicitly targeted by recreational or commercial fisheries in many parts of its range, it is also taken as incidental catch as part of nearshore multi-species fisheries, particularly those targeting small pelagics (Martín <em>et al</em>. 2008). Off Senegal, juveniles and adults are heavily targeted by purse-seine and recruitment overfishing is likely occurring.","<strong><em>Population structure</em><br/></strong>This seasonal migratory species is found in about 8–10 geographically isolated subpopulations (Briggs 1960, Goodbred and Graves 1996); northeastern Atlantic (U.S. east coast), southwestern Atlantic (southern Brazil), Mediterranean (Turkey), northwestern Africa, southern Africa (Angola and South Africa), northern Indian (Somalia, Oman, India), and Australia (western and eastern). Despite its larval capacity for long-distance dispersal, gene flow between subpopulations is severely limited (Goodbred and Graves 1996). Recent study indicates that western and eastern Atlantic populations appear to be isolated (Pardiñas <em>et al</em>. 2010). Very little information is available on its subpopulations in the northern Indian Ocean portion of its range.<br/><strong><br/><em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Global&#160;</span></em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><em>FAO landings statistics summary</em></span></strong><strong style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/></strong>The following Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) fishing regions reported landings in 2011: Eastern Central Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Atlantic, Western Central Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Southeast Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Pacific, Southwest Pacific.&#160;The period of three generation lengths is estimated at 15-24 years. <u>Overall global landings declined by 7-46% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(calculated using the endpoints of the data) (FAO 2013)</u><u>.</u> The largest fisheries occur&#160;in the southwestern Atlantic (Brazil), the western Atlantic along the&#160;eastern USA, the southern Mediterranean along Africa, southern Africa, and eastern Australia.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic</strong></em><br/><u>U.S. Atlantic</u><br/>Along the U.S. Atlantic, this species is managed as a single, migratory stock distributed from Maine to eastern Florida. This management regime/unit stock hypothesis is supported by genetic data (Graves   <em>et al</em>. 1992, Goodbred and Graves 1996, Davidson 2002, Wood 2013). It is&#160;abundant and widespread along the eastern U.S. (Kendall and Walford 1979) and supports a significant recreational fishery and a smaller commercial fishery in the U.S. (Rodger and Zharen 2012). Concerns surrounding population decline caused fishery managers to implement a rebuilding plan for the stock in 2001, and as a result of these measures, the population gradually increased and was determined to have been rebuilt by 2007.&#160;Historically, total stock biomass estimates peaked in 1982, then declined by 77% by 1996 before increasing by 64% to 2010 and slightly declining again by 4% in 2012&#160;(Wood 2013).&#160;Fishing mortality steadily declined between 1987 to 1999 and has remained steady since 2000.&#160;The most recent stock assessment update for the Atlantic coast indicated it was&#160;not overfished, nor experiencing overfishing (Wood 2014). <u>Estimated total abundance</u><u>&#160;declined by 13-34% over the past 15-24 years&#160;</u><u>(1999-2013 and 1990-2013)</u><u>, estimated total biomass declined by 7% over the past 24 years and increased by 31% over the past 15 years, and estimated spawning stock biomass increased by 16-27%&#160;</u><u>&#160;over the past 15-24 years&#160;</u><u>(calculated using the endpoints of the data) (Wood 2014; pages 24-25 Tables 10 and 11).</u>&#160;Estimated recruitment has remained relatively constant since 2002, but dropped to an all time low in 2012 (Wood 2013). Recruitment increased in 2013 and it is now thought that low estimates in recent years can be attributed to a biased model (Wood 2014). Models indicate that biomass may continue to decline into the future under current fishing pressure if poor recruitment continues. In addition, changes in fishery-independent survey methods as well as limited age information and lack of data on discard size have contributed to uncertainty in the stock assessment (Wood 2013). In response, a coast-wide sampling program was established&#160;in 2012 to improve the data used in future stock assessments.<br/><br/><u>Gulf of Mexico</u><br/>This species is landed incidentally in fisheries targeting other coastal migrants (<em>Scomberomorus</em> spp., <em>Rachycentron canadum</em>). Due to minimal catch levels, it is not managed within the Coastal Migratory Pelagics Fishery Management Plan of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (as of 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, commercial landings over the past 25 years (1990-2012) declined from about 230 mt in 1990 to 30 mt in 1998, and then increased again to about 110 mt in 2012. By comparison, commercial landings in 2012 in the Atlantic stock was 2,236 mt (Wood 2014), which is 20 times greater than in the Gulf of Mexico. There are no catch statistics for Mexico. This species has a smaller body size in the Gulf of Mexico compared to individuals in the Atlantic population (Barger 1990).<br/><br/><u>Southwestern Atlantic</u><br/>This species is widely distributed off eastern South America, but is more abundant south of Rio de Janeiro (23S). Individuals off southern Brazil are smaller than those along the U.S. Atlantic and northeastern Africa (Haimovici and Krug 1996). This species is considered relatively abundant from southern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) to northern Argentina where it comprises a single stock and is fished with purse-seines and gill-nets (Juanes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). Landings from Rio de Janeiro to Argentina averaged about 5000 t from 1970 to 1992 and peaked at 15,000 t in 1971. Most landings occurred in Brazil (88.5%), followed by Argentina (11.4%) and Uruguay (0.1%). Within Brazil, the majority of landings occur in the waters off Rio de Janeiro and Brazilian fisheries are data-poor in general (Silvano and Begossi 2010). The purse-seine fishery is largely sustained by individuals age 1-3 years (age at first maturity is 2-3 years), with age-1 fish representing 53.2% of the total number and 35.2% of the total weight. Between 1976 and 1983, over 99% of the catches were of individuals aged 1 to 4 years; as such, this fishery is likely at a high risk for recruitment overfishing. <u>Off Rio de Janeiro, estimated catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) declined by 54% over the past 17 years (1992-2008) (</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data) (Bender <em>et al.</em> 2014 supplemental data)</u><u>.</u> Fishers interviewed about observed trends in bluefish landings&#160;corroborated the observed decline in CPUE. Results of the interviews indicated that the amount caught by line fishers declined by 70% over the past 50 years (1960-2010) and in the beach seine fishery by 80% over the past 60 years (Bender <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><u>Eastern Central Atlantic</u><br/>Landings are recorded by northern CECAF (Fishery Committee of the Eastern Central Atlantic), a fishing region defined within the bluefish range as Morocco to Gambia, including the Canaries and Madeira Islands and Cape Verde Islands. Landings peaked in the 1970s and have generally declined since then (FAO 2013). There was a severe decline in landings from 1970 (peak of 19000 tonnes) to 1986 (less than 2,000 tonnes), and has since been fluctuating around 4,000-5,000 metric tonnes over the past 20 years.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 52-61% over the past 15-24 years (</u><u>1999-2013 and&#160;</u><u>1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(CECAF via FAO FishstatJ 2013).&#160;</u>A data series in the Improve Scientific and Technical Advice for Fisheries Management (ISTAM) project database (1962-1999) reveals fluctuations in mean weight until 1988, when mean weight averaged 2.6 kg, followed by a period of decline to an average weight of 1.1 kg in 1999 (ISTAM database, Camar unpublished data 2013). This species was formerly considered common off Senegal, but recently, only juveniles are occasionally seen (S. Mor pers. comm. 2012) and it is now considered commercially extinct (Belhabib<em> et al.</em> 2014). It may be retained in purse-seine fisheries targeting small pelagics (i.e. clupeoids) as it is in some Mediterranean fisheries, but this is not quantified nor confirmed.&#160;<br/><br/><u>Mediterranean<br/></u>Genetic evidence indicates there is regional population structuring between the eastern and western Mediterranean (Pardiñas 2010).&#160;Landings data imply that&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>&#160;is most abundant in the eastern Mediterranean and has only recently begun being fished in the western Mediterranean. It occurs as&#160;by-catch in the&#160;anchovy and sardine&#160;purse-seine fishery off&#160;the Catalan Coast&#160;(Martín&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).&#160;Patterns of morphological differentiation suggest the existence of three distinct groups in the Mediterranean and Black Seas: the eastern Black Sea, the western Black Sea/Marmara Sea/Aegean Sea, and the northeastern Mediterranean (Turan&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006). In the past, this species was primarily taken as bycatch with smaller schooling clupeoid species, but is now directly targeted via commercial purse seine (Dhieb <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Landings in the western Mediterranean increased from &lt;50 tonnes prior to 1996 to a peak of 200 tonnes in 2010, possibly reflecting the increased abundance and northward expansion of this species in the western Mediterranean in response to warming sea temperatures in the region (Sabatés<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2012). <u>Overall regional landings declined by 33% over the past 24 years (1990-2013) and increased by 49% over the past 15 years (1999-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).&#160;</u>Overfishing of larger species such as the bluefish occurred in the 1960-70s and reconstructed catches indicate that it has been declining since around 1980 (Ulman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The largest commercial bluefish<em>&#160;</em>fishery in the Mediterranean is located in Turkey, and is among the most frequently landed species in the recreational fishery in the Ankakale Strait (also Turkey) (Ünal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<u>Reconstructed total bluefish landings off Turkey declined by 32% over the past 24 years (1987-2010) and increased by 7% over the past 15 years&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(Ulman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013; Table 5 page 339).&#160;</u>The&#160;mean length of individuals caught in Turkey&#160;decreased by 44% between 1959 to 2004 (45 years) and fishing mortality is too high (Akyol and Ceyhan 2007, Cengiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;Catch from the Black Sea increased until the late 1980s, and has since declined (Keskin 2012). The primary gear used is purse seine, which exerts heavy fishing pressure on young, migrating individuals. In the past, the bluefish&#160;entered the Black Sea seasonally, but is now rarely present due stock depletion in the region (Lleonart 2008).&#160;Off Tunisia, this species is exploited by artisanal fishers and commercial purse seiners and is also experiencing growth overfishing in this area (Dhieb <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).<br/><br/><u>Northeast Atlantic and Azores</u><br/>In the Azores, it is targeted in the pole-and-line coastal pelagic fishery from June to October&#160;(Pinho<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Landings in the Northeast Atlantic FAO fishing zone are declared by Spain and Portugal. Overall landings peaked in 1997 at 1,914 tonnes and subsequently declined by 97% to 59 tonnes by 2000 and has been stable around that level ever since.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 77-87% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).</u>&#160;In the Gulf of Cadiz, landings fluctuated&#160;between 2001 to 2009 with a slight overall declining trend. <u>According to data collected by the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) in the Gulf of Cadiz, biomass&#160;(g/haul) declined by about 80%&#160;and CPUE (number/haul) by 50% over the past 17 years (1997-2013) (J. Gil Herrera pers. comm., IBTS Trawl Survey Data).<br/></u><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>Southern Africa</em><br/></strong><u>Southeastern Atlantic - Angola<br/></u>In the southeastern Atlantic, this species&#160;is heavily targeted off southern Angola by the growing industrial, artisanal, subsistence and recreational sectors (especially after a civil war that ended in 2002). This increase in fishing pressure has had negative impacts on marine resources in the area, including&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>. Truncation of age (26% reduction in maximum age) and length (11% reduction in max length), and reduction of female dominance between study periods reflects the selective removal of large, old individuals. This&#160;is likely to have negative consequences for its reproductive success. Fisheries management policies are considered insufficient and ineffective.&#160;<u>Overall regional landings declined by 64-99% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).</u>&#160;The Angola population appears to be isolated from the South African population (Maggs <em>et al.</em> 2012); it is less common between northern Namibia and Cape Point, South Africa except within Saldanha Bay (Maggs and Mann 2013).&#160;<br/><br/><em><strong>Western Indian Ocean </strong></em><br/>Recent surveys have suggested a bi-polar distribution of&#160;<em>P. saltatrix</em>&#160;in the Western Indian Ocean. It has been found off Puntland in Somalia and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, but not between these latitudes (van der Elst<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004). There is currently no information about this species in the northwestern Indian Ocean. Reported landings of this species to the FAO from the western Indian Ocean zone have been very few since records first began in 1950; however, it is known that its population off Oman is exploited (Chesalin <em>et al.</em> 2012). This species undertakes annual northward migrations from the southeastern coast of South Africa, and reaches the waters of KwaZulu-Natal to spawn in late spring (van der Elst 1976). It is&#160;heavily fished by shore anglers along the KwaZulu-Natal coast (Beckley and Connell 1996) and is caught by subsistence fishers in the eastern and western Cape (Maggs and Mann 2013). CPUE declined by 60% between 1956-1973, but varied from year to year (van der Elst 1976). A 1997 assessment considered the stock to be overexploited (Govender 1997).&#160;<u>Overall South Africa landings reported to FAO declined by 82-89% over the past 15-24 years (1999-2013 and 1990-2013)&#160;</u><u>(</u><u>calculated using the endpoints of the data)&#160;</u><u>(FAO 2013).&#160;</u><u>As recorded by Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife shore patrols, CPUE declined by about 80% between 1985-2009 (25 years); however, there is considerable uncertainty that this is an accurate representation of its overall population status as it excludes data from offshore areas (Maggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).</u>&#160;Despite management intervention, which included the revision of management protocols in 2005, no improvement in catch rates were detected between 2005-2012. <br/><strong><br/></strong><em><strong>Australia</strong></em><br/>Australia has two genetically distinct exploited populations, one on the east coast in New South Wales and southern&#160;Queensland, and one on the west coast (Leigh and O'Neill 2004). Total catches along western Australia are low and it is thought that the population is comparatively small. This species&#160;is heavily exploited by both the recreational and commercial sectors off&#160;Queensland-New South Wales, eastern Australia and over 80% of fish available to the fishery have been regularly harvested. Biomass is estimated at about 40% of unexploited levels (60% decline in biomass) and is about half the level seen in the 1970s. Fishing pressure has caused a decrease in body length over the history of the fishery and very few fish older than age three remain in the population. <u>In eastern Australia, standardized catch rates declined by 50% from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s (roughly three generation lengths), and the proportion of unexploited biomass dropped by 55% to 68%, depending on the degree of increase in recreational fishing pressure incorporated into the model (Leigh and O'Neill 2004).</u><br/><br/>Commercial and recreational fisheries are spatially segregated in western Australia; commercial fisheries are mostly in the Gascoyne Coast Bioregion (GCB), while recreational fisheries are primarily in the West Coast Bioregion (WCB). Although previously managed separately, evidence suggests that a single stock extends across both bioregions. It has been assumed by Smith <em>et al.</em> (2013) that the majority of the spawning stock is located in the GCB. The status of the&#160;western Australia population was assessed by the Department of Fisheries, Western Australia in 2013. Anecdotal evidence suggests a substantial decline in WCB recreational catch rates during the 1980s and 1990s; however, recent data indicate improvement in the stock's status, which may have been due to changes in fishing regulations that occurred between 1990-2009. Catch rates in the commercial fishery suggest that abundance in the GCB declined after 2000, but is still high compared to historical levels&#160;(i.e. pre-1990).&#160;Catch rates in the GCB suggest that current spawning stock biomass is relatively high and recruitment in the WCB has been increasing since 2004. These indicators suggest that there is currently a low risk for overfishing; however, this is based on several assumptions on stock structure that should be verified to improve future stock assessments (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>Overall Global Population Status</em><br/></strong>Given that each subpopulation appears to be isolated from each other and it is unknown whether one contributes a higher proportion to the overall global population or not, the declines were straight averaged equally across all subpopulations. This included zero place-holders for those areas where the population is stable (Gulf of Mexico and Western Australia).&#160;The overall (global) averaged minimum and maximum estimates for decline ranged from 39-53% over the past three generation lengths (15-24 years). We chose a range of values for the time series due to the uncertainty associated with generation length as well as the varied nature of the data types available from each individual area.",Decreasing,"This migratory, pelagic marine fish is found in about 8–10 isolated subpopulations in coastal temperate and subtropical waters of all ocean basins except the eastern Pacific (Briggs 1960, Goodbred and Graves 1996). Its distribution coincides with sea surface temperatures of 18-27°C, and it has been suggested that range shifts amongst subpopulations have resulted due to historical changes in water temperature.<br/><br/>In the western Atlantic Ocean it is known from Nova Scotia (Canada) south along the U.S., Bermuda, throughout the Gulf of Mexico. and along South America from Santa Marta, Colombia to Bahia San Blas, Argentina (Goodbred and Graves 1996,&#160;Collette 2002, Robertson and Van Tassell 2015). It may be absent from northern Brazil within the vicinity of large river mouths such as the Amazon (Goodbred and Graves 1996). In the eastern Atlantic&#160;it occurs in the Mediterranean and Black Seas,&#160;the Azores (Santos&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997), Canary Islands (Dooley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985), Madeira (Whitehead&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1986), Cape Verde Islands (Monteiro 1998,&#160;Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), Portugal south to northern Gambia (S. Mor pers. comm. 2012), and from southern Angola to South Africa (Goodbred and Graves 1996).&#160;It is absent from the Gulf of Guinea region (F. Nunoo pers. comm. 2015).&#160;It also occurs in the Indian Ocean from South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar&#160;(van der Elst 1976),&#160;Somalia (Puntland)&#160;(van der Elst<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2004), southern Oman, and southwest India (Randall 1995).&#160;It occurs along eastern Australia from Frasier Island to the New South Wales/Victoria border and along western Australia from Onslow to Albany. It is less common off southern Australia and in the Great Australian Bight (Kailola&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993, Goodbred and Graves 1996). Records from the Malay Peninsula (Randall 1995, Goodbred and Graves 1996),&#160;Taiwan (Shen 1993), Hawaii (Hureau 1991),&#160;Northern Territory (Australia), and Indonesia appear to be erroneous&#160;(Collette 1999). Its depth range is 0-200 m (B. Collette pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>It is&#160;expanding its range northwards in response to recent (late 20th century) warming of the deep and upper layers of western Mediterranean (Sabatés<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2012). Northern-most records in the Mediterranean include the southern Catalan coast (Sabatés&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012) and the northern Adriatic (Dulčić&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).","This species is highly-valued in both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. It is caught mainly with gill net, hook-and-line, and purse seine.&#160;Historically, the recreational fishery has accounted for 80% to 90% of the total catch in U.S waters. Off Senegal and Mauritania, the commercial fishery is characterized by large, automated, foreign vessels operating offshore that are&#160;equipped&#160;to capture and process/preserve product. There is evidence that inshore marine fish stocks in these countries are facing increasing fishing pressure (van der Elst<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005). In Angola, this species contributes to&#160;an important recreational fishery that is utilized primarily by visiting anglers from South Africa (Potts&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In the Mediterranean along the Catalan Coast, it occurs as bycatch in the purse-seine fishery for small schooling pelagics such as anchovy and sardine (Martín <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<p><br/></p><p></p>",Marine,"Subpopulations of this species are subject to varying degrees of fisheries management throughout its range. In 2014, this species was regionally assessed as Near Threatened in the Europe region due to overexploitation and regionally assessed as Least Concern in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015 due to no significant decline.<br/>&#160;<br/>The use of seasonal area closures in South Africa (Govender 1996, Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012) and Australia (Zeller <em>et al</em>. 1996, Ward <em>et al</em>. 2003) is thought to protect spawning adult <em>P. saltatrix</em> from such selective fishing pressures (Bealey 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>United States</em></strong><br/>The Atlantic coast stock is jointly managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. A total annual quota is established and allocations are given to commercial and recreational fisheries (Wood 2013). Regulations also include permits and limits on size and bag (Shepard 2006, NMFS 2012). A rebuilding plan established in 2001 has allowed this subpopulation to increase (Wood 2013) and action is under way to improve uncertainty in some of the data utilized for the stock assessment.<br/><br/><strong><em>Brazil</em></strong><br/>Despite economic importance and indications of significant decline, Brazilian bluefish fisheries are data-poor and not formally managed. Suggested conservation measures include reduction of fishing effort by purse seines and limiting the capture of juveniles (Silvano and Begossi 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Atlantic/Mediterranean</strong></em><br/>This species does not appear to be managed in the western Mediterranean. Regulations such as minimum mesh sizes, size limits, and gear restrictions are in place in parts of the eastern Mediterranean. However, in the case of Turkey where the majority of landings are taken, these regulations are not adhered to (Ulman 2005). According to Cengiz et al. (2013), growth overfishing in the Turkey population will continue unless gear restrictions and minimum size limits are implemented and enforced.<br/><br/><strong><em>Eastern Central Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Other than the collection of catch data, this species is not managed in the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, efforts to control fishing effort are the principal tool of management, and are applied indirectly through licensing. Legislation prohibits trawling within 12 miles of the Mauritanian coast. Additionally, pelagic trawlers and purse seines are prohibited from utilizing nets with a mesh-size less than 40 mm.<br/><br/><em><strong>Angola and South Africa</strong></em><br/>Off Angola, management of this fishery is inadequate. Fisheries management policies in Angola favour development and there is little accuracy in monitoring. Off South Africa, there is an annual closed season for this species from 1 October to 30 November as well as a minimum capture size of 30 cm and a 4-fish bag limit (Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Republic of South Africa 2014). Commercial exploitation is prohibited in the KwaZulu-Natal (Maggs <em>et al</em>. 2012). Despite revision of management protocols in 2005, no improvement in catch rates were detected. Poor angler compliance and lack of regulation knowledge indicate that alternate management measures are needed. Recommendations include the establishment of a marine protected area network (Dunlop and Mann 2012). A nation-wide stock assessment for this species is urgently needed (Maggs and Mann 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>Australia</em></strong><br/>In Australia, recreational fishery regulations have included minimum legal sizes (typically between 23-35 cm TL), quotas, and temporal closures to coincide with spawning aggregations (Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several assumptions about stock structure need to be clarified through improved data collection when developing future stock assessments (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2013).<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""></span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><p></p></span>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
115334224,194365,Lutjanus campechanus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2015,2015-08-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widely distributed&#160;over hard bottom and sand habitats in the entire Gulf of Mexico and to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on the U.S. east coast. It is long-lived (to 57 years), reaches full reproductive maturity at about 10+ years of age, and generation length is estimated to be 22 years.<br/><br/>Its population is subjected to heavy exploitation by both recreational and commercial fisheries throughout this area. The population is considered to consist of three separate stocks: (1) the U.S. Atlantic; (2) the U.S. Gulf of Mexico; and (3) the Mexican Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>The majority of historic landings have come from the Gulf of Mexico. The Red Snapper is of high economic value and the majority (74-87%) of the Mexican catch is exported to the U.S. and other countries. Since 1945 (past three generation lengths), stock biomass in the U.S Atlantic declined by 95.8% and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico declined between 33-68%. Off Mexico, landings declined by 58% between 1980-2013 (with the peak occurring in 1993) and effort is assumed to have increased in some areas. Biomass on the Campeche Bank (an area of historically high abundance) declined by 49% between 1984-1999 and apparently has not recovered. Juvenile Red Snapper are susceptible to shrimp trawling in the Gulf of Mexico which has significantly reduced recruitment to the exploited phase. Bycatch reduction devices are now required in the U.S. shrimp fishery, but are not universally implemented in Mexican shrimp fisheries.&#160;The Red Snapper has the potential for rapid recovery. The U.S. Gulf commercial sector has been managed by an individual fishing quota (IFQ) program since 2007 and landings have not exceeded the IFQ. In the U.S., the recreational sector is managed with short fishing seasons, small bag limits, gear and size restrictions. The U.S. Atlantic stock has been under a moratorium since 2010, with only limited openings over the past two years. Due to these management measures, both U.S. stocks have shown evidence of rebuilding in recent years, and detailed data collection and stock assessment protocols are in place to closely monitor commercial and recreational fisheries. The Mexican stock was last assessed 15 years ago (2000), at which time exploitation rates exceeded those that produced maximum sustainable yield, suggesting that overfishing was occurring. Currently, the Mexican commercial fishery is regulated through permitting and gear restrictions; however, the efficacy of enforcement is unknown. Recent Mexican government reports urge the reduction of fishing effort in the fishery, but there is no formal management plan.&#160;Data have not been available from the Mexican fishery for three generation lengths (66 years). However, landings increased from 1980 (the first available year of data) to 1993. This increase in landings may represent an increase in effort and does not likely represent an increase in population size. The 1993&#160;landings of 7,205 mt was the highest in the 33 year time series, but it is a conservative estimate of possible maximum landings potential based on the data from the past, when nominal fishing effort (rather than population abundance) likely constrained landings. However, we assumed that effort has remained stable or increased in Mexican waters since 1993, such that the 58% decline in landings is proportional to a similar declines in the population. Therefore, it is inferred that a population decline of at least 58% has occurred in&#160;the Mexican component of the fishery&#160;over the past three generation lengths.&#160;Given this, the average estimated population decline was at least 46% (average of 33% and 58%), and the threat of overfishing continues. Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2bd). Additionally, we recommend that&#160;precautionary fishery management be adhered to and enforcement against illegal fishing activity is expanded in U.S. waters. Increases in the quantity of fishery and biological data for the Mexican component would greatly improve Red Snapper stock assessments and enforcement in Mexican waters.","Adults of this species are found over natural and artificial hard bottoms. Juveniles inhabit shallow waters, including estuaries and are common over sandy or muddy bottoms (Castro-Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 1999). It occurs in depths ranging from a few meters as juveniles, to over 600 m as adults (Camber 1955, Bradley and Bryan 1975).&#160;Telemetry studies off Alabama found high site fidelity rates (72% yr<sup>-1</sup>) and long residence times (20-1099 days)&#160;on natural and artificial habitats (Topping and Szedlmayer 2011a,b); manual tracking over 24 hours in similar locations suggested that individuals remain close to artificial reef structures, with about 75% of all fish locations with 30 m of reef sites (Topping and Szedlmayer 2011b). Individuals&#160;collected from standing platforms were significantly younger, but larger, than the red snapper from the shelf edge banks (Cowan<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).&#160;Red Snapper feed mainly on fishes, shrimps, crabs, worms, cephalopods, and some planktonic items including urochordates and gastropods  (Szedlemayr and Lee 2004).<br/>&#160;<br/>The maximum size reported is 100 cm total length (TL) (Allen 1985, Robins and Ray 1986) and 22.8 kg (Allen 1985). By age five,&#160;100% of&#160;females are&#160;mature and 50% mature by age 1.4 years; 100% of males mature by age four (SEDAR 31 2013), but it does not&#160;reach full reproductive potential until ages 10-12+. The m<span style="""">aximum reported age in the Gulf of Mexico is 57 years. The maximum observed age in the US South Atlantic is 54 years</span>. Field surveys suggest that older fish spawn more frequently&#160;and have a longer spawning season (Fitzhugh <em>et al</em>. 2012,&#160;Kulaw 2012,&#160;Lowerre-Barbieri <em>et al. </em>2012). There was a positive correlation between the number of spawning events per season with age (Kulaw 2012). The increased annual fecundity of older females would likely increase the generation length. Calculated batch at age and proportion mature at age&#160;can be found in&#160;Fitzhugh <em>et al.</em> (2012). The average age of reproducing adults being caught in the commercial fishery is 5-7 years, and individuals over 10 years of age are rarely caught (SEDAR 31 2013).<br/><br/>This&#160;gonochoristic&#160;species reaches maturity at 20.8-30.9 cm TL (Grimes 1987, Patterson&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2001, Woods 2003). Along the Southeastern United States, White and Palmer (2004) found that the smallest mature male was 20 cm TL, and the largest immature male was 37.8 cm TL; 50% of males are mature at 22.3 cm TL, while 50% of females are mature at 37.8 cm TL. Spawning season varies with location, but in most cases occurs nearly year round (Grimes 1987). White and Palmer (2004) reported that the spawning season off the southeastern United States extends from May to October, peaking in July through September. On Campeche Bank, it spawns between April-October (Gonzalez-De La Rosa and Re-Regis 2001).<br/><u><br/>This assessment uses a generation length of 22 years based on data presented in&#160;SEDAR 24 (2010).</u>","This species has been historically heavily exploited in U.S. waters, but is now under a government-mandated management plans in both the US Gulf and Atlantic jurisdictions&#160;to end overfishing, including a five year fishing moratorium in the US Atlantic. It is also highly valued in Mexican waters, but we could not identify formal management planning or stock assessment documents, though overfishing is assumed to be occurring. Bycatch of juvenile Red Snapper in Gulf shrimp trawl fisheries may have contributed to population declines of the stock. Shrimp fishery bycatch in U.S. waters has declined (SEDAR 31 2013); however, substantial fishery bycatch remains in Mexican waters (SAGARPA 2012) and bycatch reductions devices are not universally implemented.<br/><br/>There is some concern that the explosive decommissioning of oil platforms poses a significant risk of mortality to surrounding fishes. It&#160;is prone to high release mortality, because it inhabits relatively deep water and possesses a physoclistus gas bladder (Campbell&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The recent implementation of an Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) system for <em>L. campechanus</em> may be causing increased release rates in the Gulf of Mexico (Cullis-Suzuki<em> et al.</em> 2012).","<strong><em>U.S. Atlantic stock</em><br/></strong>The U.S. Atlantic stock component has been estimated to have about one-third the biomass of the Gulf of Mexico stock component (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015). From 1955-2010, t<u>he total stock biomass declined by 96% in the U.S. (SEDAR 24 2010). </u>This period does not exactly span three generation lengths; however, population declines likely exceed 96% for this whole period. Commercial Red Snapper landings increased from 1950 to the late 1960s (North Carolina to eastern Florida), peaking at 473 mt in 1968 (Manooch <em>et al. </em>1998, National Marine Fisheries Service pers. comm.). Between 1975-1998, annual landings declined from 327 mt to 40 mt. Eastern Florida landings dominated the catches through the mid 1970s, after which a precipitous decline occurred. Between 1990-2001, 58% of the total Red Snapper landings came from on Florida's Atlantic coast; with 6% in Georgia, 25% in South Carolina, and 11% in North Carolina. Recreational landings of red snapper peaked in 1985 at 605 mt. In 2014,&#160;recreational fishermen&#160;landed 477 mt, in spite of an extremely limited season. Manooch <em>et al</em>. (1998) suggested that the fishing mortality rate (F) should be reduced by 33% to 68%, depending on the natural mortality rate and desired SPR. These results were revisited by Potts and Brennan (2001) who suggested a broader range of reduction in F, from 30% to 80%. Prior to 2006, red snapper was listed as overfished in the South Atlantic (SEDAR 24 2010). As such, Amendment 4 to the South Atlantic Council’s Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan&#160;(regulations effective January 1992) implemented a rebuilding plan of 15 years beginning in 1991. Its status was changed to unknown because the previous pre-SFA determination of overfished was based on SPR (spawning potential ratio), which is inadequate because it is not biomass-based. Based on the results from SEDAR 15 (2008), it was reported as overfished and a new rebuilding plan was developed in Amendment 17A to the Snapper Grouper FMP. The 2010 stock assessment (SEDAR 24 2010) indicated that the U.S. southeast stock of red snapper is currently overfished and is experiencing overfishing. The estimated time series of F/FMSY suggests that overfishing has been occurring at least since the mid-1990's. The increase in stock status appears to have been assisted by the 1992 management regulations, and then perhaps reinforced by strong recruitment events. Base-run estimates of spawning biomass have remained below MSST throughout most of the time series. Current stock status was estimated in the base run to be SSB2009/MSST = 0.09. The estimated time series of F /FMSY suggests that overfishing has been occurring throughout most of the assessment period; F2007-2009/FMSY = 4.12. No new evidence is available that suggests the Atlantic and Gulf should be managed as a single stock, and no new evidence of regional separation within the Atlantic is available. An updated stock assessment for the south Atlantic region (anticipated SEDAR 41) is scheduled to be completed in November and peer-reviewed in&#160;2016. Preliminary analyses of fishery independent survey data indicate a large increase in CPUE from 2010 onwards, due in part to the fishery closure initiated in 2010 for the southeast U.S.; the stock is showing strong evidence for rebuilding over recent years (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>U.S. Gulf of Mexico stock</em><br/></strong>The U.S. Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery, which is targeted by commercial, for-hire, and recreational fishermen, is currently classified as overfished. The stock itself is divided into eastern and western Gulf components based on area-specific life history characteristics, catch statistics, and survey indices. The recovery of the population in the US Gulf is largely dependent upon the northwestern Gulf stock, which has long been considered to be the historical center of red snapper abundance&#160;<u>(SEDAR 31 2013)</u>.&#160;<u>In the eastern and western Gulf, estimates of spawning stock biomass have declined about 80-90% since the 1940s (although the majority of the population is in the western Gulf). Spawning stock biomass has been relatively stable at very low levels since the mid-1980's. According to the most recent stock assessment (SEDAR 31 2013), predicted total biomass declines ranged between 33-68% over the years 1945-2011.&#160;</u>Total biomass and spawning biomass steadily declined from the late 1880s through the early 1900s, and was stable up to the 1940s (SEDAR 31 2013). The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council implemented a Reef fish Fishery Management Plan in 1984 to rebuild declining reef fish stocks, including Red Snapper. Evidence of a decline in the adult population was documented as early as the late 1980s, during which the fishery was primarily supported by age<sup>-1</sup> to age<sup>-3</sup> fish. When the first Red Snapper stock assessment was conducted (Goodyear 1988), the stock was determined to be so overfished that reductions in fishing mortality of 60-70% would be required to rebuild the stock. The effective number of spawners in the eastern and western populations are estimated to have been reduced in 2003 to 39% and 50%, respectively. The effective spawner levels associated with the SMSY{current-shrimp} benchmark equates to 12.9% and 5.2% of unfished levels in the east and west, respectively (SEDAR 7 2005).&#160;Recreational landings from the US Gulf of Mexico have declined by 77% over 31 years; from 2.61 million individuals in 1981 to 0.59 million in 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014). The number of estimated individuals released alive annually has increased from 55,153 in 1981 to 1.42 million individuals in 2012 (NMFS pers. comm. 2014); but many individuals suffer mortality from barotrauma.<br/><br/>The predicted mean age was 3.5 years in the year 1872 and since fishing began, declined to between 0.5-0.9 in 2004 (SEDAR 31 2013). The annual index of abundance in the northern Gulf from Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) ranged from near 0 to about 4.5 between 1982 and 2011, with no clear increasing or decreasing trends through the time series. There was a peak between 1989-1992, followed by a 14 year period of low abundances; since 2006, the index of abundance has fluctuated almost yearly (Pollack&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, see Figure 14 for data). This could be indicative of a substantial decline in the population prior to the initiation of the SEAMAP sampling program. A bioeconomic model intended to evaluate the different recreational management strategies found that the red snapper fishery in the Gulf of Mexico was not overfished or experiencing overfishing. This model incorporated density dependence and utilized a higher juvenile natural mortality rate, which likely caused the divergence between this model and previous stock assessment models. Although the authors did not suggest that this model replace the stock assessment, the results suggest that the red snapper fishery is underfished and the current management strategies are inefficient (Griffin and Woodward 2011).<br/><br/>In 2008, the Gulf of Mexico stock was evaluated as overfished and undergoing overfishing and in 2013, it was declared rebuilt (SEDAR 31 2013). Although populations in the U.S. no longer appear to be declining, annual catch limits in U.S. Gulf waters have been raised to 4,990 mt in response to strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 that occur on average every 5–7 years. Management has responded to increases in biomass by raising red snapper catch limits, only to have to reduce catches two to three years later to comply with the rebuilding schedule for this species. For example, after the strong 1989 year-class, catches were increased to 9.1 mt, only to be reduced because it became apparent the sustained catches were too high to meet management objectives. Similar histories occurred after strong year classes in 1995, and 1999-2000 and now in 2013 in response to the 2004 and 2006 year-classes. It is likely that landings of 11 mp going forward are unsustainable. There was some evidence that productivity of the stock was increasing in the early 2000s, but this trend appears to have ceased in recent years. In addition, the most recent benchmark stock assessment assumes that the S-R relationship has a very high estimate of steepness (0.99), inferring that recruitment may be almost independent of stock size. The SSR_Steepness factor is 0.94 for this species, which indicates the potential for a rapid recovery under the right conditions and that recruitment may be independent from stock size. Projections indicate that red snapper stock can rebuild within 31 years which is the longest recommended period by the NOAA Fisheries NSGs.&#160;The most recent stock assessment for the Gulf of Mexico is SEDAR 31 (2013). Though management has been more stringent for the Atlantic population than the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, biomass appears to be increasing at the same rate for both populations in recent years. Up to 20% of its historical biomass has been recovered within the past 20 years (equal to most recent generation length).&#160;<br/><br/>Furthermore, Red Snapper in the U.S. Gulf have a selectivity function that is dome shaped. Large, old, adult red snapper (highly fecund) have less affinity for structured habitat and move off higher relief natural and artificial reefs after they are about 10 years old. Most of these fish move onto either very low relief shell-rubble reefs or muddy/sandy bottoms with no relief, where they form small groups. Prior to 1990, there was a longline fishery for these large red snapper. Since 1990, longlines have been prohibited inside of 91 m, making these fish less vulnerable to exploitation. This has important consequences concerning stock status now because the time period (1980s to early 1990s) when the Gulf red snapper stock was at its lowest biomass (~20 years ago) was the time when most of today's most fecund spawners should have been produced, but were not, leaving a very truncated age distribution. There has been some rebuilding in the number of larger spawners, but high catches since the early 1990s appear to be limiting escapement to older age classes. As such, this species may rapidly recover much more under the right management (i.e., constant F) and governance conditions (J. Cowan pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The overfished status of the Red Snapper fishery is the result of not only an excessive amount of effort in the directed fishery, but also, a high level of bycatch mortality of juveniles by shrimp trawling. Without some reduction in bycatch, stock assessments projected that the stock cannot rebuild to BMSY even if no harvest was allowed in the directed fishery (SEDAR 31 2013). Therefore, large reductions in bycatch mortality from the shrimp fishery need to be achieved either through technological means such as bycatch reduction devices, or through a reduction in effort by the shrimp fishery. Currently, BRDs are estimated to achieve about a 40 percent reduction in red snapper bycatch and are required by law. The Gulf shrimp fishery was one of the most economically important fisheries in the United States, but effort has significantly declined since 2002 and it is now not considered to be a major threat to the stock's ability to rebuild (SEDAR 31 2013).&#160;<br/><br/><strong><em>Mexico<br/></em></strong>This is one of the most important Mexican fishery resources in the Gulf of Mexico, with a historical centre of abundance on the Campeche Bank (Gonzalez-De La Rosa and Re-Regis 2001). Snappers are targeted by commercial and artisanal longline and hand line fisheries.&#160;<em>Lutjanus campechanus</em>&#160;is considered part of a multi-species fishery off Mexico, but represents 90% of the overall catch. The majority (74-87%) of red snapper landings are sold to international markets, while smaller species are sold domestically. Between the 1950s to 1970s (prior to the establishment of EEZ boundaries), U.S. and Cuban fishing fleets also exploited red snapper on the Campeche Bank (J. Ault pers. comm. 2015). In 2012, at least 16 Cuban vessels held permits to fish for snapper in Mexican waters (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>Based on declining catch trends off Yucatan, Campeche and Veracruz, the fishery has deteriorated significantly.&#160;<u>Landings in Mexico have declined by 58% over the past 20 years, from 7,205 t in 1993 to 3,021 t in 2013 (SAGARPA annual landings reports 1980-2013). Effort is assumed to have been constant and possibly increased in some areas. In addition, biomass on the Campeche Bank declined by 49% between 1984-1999 (Instituto Nacional de la Pesca&#160;2000 via C. Monroy and T. Brule pers. comm. 2015)&#160;</u><u>and has not recovered</u><u>.&#160;</u>The estimated initial biomass (1984) was 33,740 t and in 1999 it was 17,150 t. There was an 80% decline in landings off Yucatan on the Campeche Bank between 1990-2013; the largest proportion (on average 27%) of the total landings are attributed to Yucatan State through the time series. There was also a 77% decline off Veracruz between 1991-2013 and a 71% decline off Campeche between 1993-2013. Landings off Tamaulipas and Quintana Roo appear to have remained stable. Effort has been increasing off Tabasco since at least 1990 and has been the leading producer of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico since 2002, but has not and likely will not reach the level of catch that Yucatan State had prior to the early 1990s. The last evaluation of the Mexican stock was conducted 15 years ago (Instituto Nacional de la Pesca&#160;2000) and this report concluded&#160;that the Campeche Bank stock was exploited slightly above its maximum sustainable yield and that a continuance of fishing at these levels would cause a decline in biomass.&#160;<br/><br/>As catch of <em>L. campechanus </em>has been declining, exploitation of other snappers such as <em>L. synagris</em> and <em>O. chrysurus</em> has been increasing (SAGARPA 2012). In addition, Mexican fishers from the state of Tamaulipas poached at least 692 mt of red snapper from U.S. waters off Texas in 2013-2014. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that they detected about 15% of these vessels that are fishing within the U.S. EEZ, which may indicate that they are taking more than is currently known (U.S. Coast Guard pers. comm. via GMFMC meeting presentation 2015). Juveniles frequently occur in large amounts as bycatch in the Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries; bycatch reduction devices are not consistently utilized in this region, but are encouraged (SAGARPA 2012).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/><em>Population connectivity<br/></em></strong>The pelagic larval duration for<em> Lujanus campechanus </em>is approximately 31 days (Rooker <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on a coupled bio-physical model of the Gulf of Mexico, larvae released on Campeche Bank are primarily retained on the bank. However, a small fraction of the released larvae were able to cross the deep basin to the southern portion of Florida (0.33%) or went through the Straits of Florida (1.6%) within 18-21 days (Johnston <em>et al</em>. 2013). Given the trajectory of the Loop Current, spawning aggregations in the northern Caribbean Sea might contribute larvae to the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Otolith chemical signatures suggest that there is little mixing between the populations in US and Mexican waters and that the larger red snapper population in the northwestern Gulf may be serving as a source region of recruits for the north central region (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is likely that the populations east and west of the Mississippi are metapopulations. Connectivity between populations in the northern Gulf and Campeche Banks is not yet confirmed, but is suspected to be low.",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina south along the U.S. and throughout the Gulf of Mexico except Cuba (Robins and Ray 1986, Anderson 2002). There are records of vagrants from Massachusetts, Cuba, and the Bahamas. Its depth range is approximately 10-190 m.&#160;Records from the Caribbean and South America are attributed to <em>Lutjanus purpureus </em>in past treatments of the <em>L. campechanus</em> and <em>L. purpureus </em>complex. Recent genetics papers suggest <em>L. purpureus</em>, Caribbean Red Snapper, is a synonym of <em>L. campechanus</em> (Gomes <em>et al.</em> 2008, Gomes<em> et al.</em> 2012). <em>Lutjanus campechanus</em> and <em>L. purpureus</em> are here treated separately based on several factors, including many functional differences between the North American and Brazil populations and their distinct literatures on biology and management. &#160;<br/><em><br/></em>","This is very important species in both commercial and recreational fisheries in U.S. and Mexican waters.&#160;It is primarily harvested with hook and line gear. Commercial fishermen typically attach multiple hooks to a weighted line.&#160;Off Mexico, it is commonly fished&#160;using the “reinales” gear with number and hook size varying for each state. Veracruz and Tamaulipas also use the ""cala huachinanguera"" and the ""Rosary"" method. The Mexican snapper fishery includes multiple species, however, <em>L. campechanus</em> comprises 90% of the landings. It is highly valuable in both domestic and international markets; most Mexican Red Snapper catch is exported for sale in international markets, while smaller snapper species are sold domestically (SAGARPA 2012).",Marine,"<strong><em>U.S. Gulf of Mexico<br/></em></strong>The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council implemented a Reef fish Fishery Management Plan in 1984 to rebuild declining reef fish stocks, including red snapper. Gulf Red Snapper is under a rebuilding program that aims to restore the stock by 2032. Recent population assessments indicate an increase under recent fishery regulations.<br/><br/>The recreational fishery for red snapper in the Gulf is open during a limited period of time per year, and catches are monitored so as not to exceed a yearly quota.&#160;Recreational anglers are permitted to keep only two red snapper per person, per day, that measure a minimum of 16 total length. In addition, anglers must have in possession a venting tool and dehooking device when fishing for Gulf reef fish. The use of non-stainless steel circle hooks is also required for fishermen using natural baits. Commercial fishing regulations include a 13-inch minimum  size limit, an annual quota of 2.55 million pounds, gear restrictions,  closed areas, and an IFQ program. The IFQ  program allocates individual shares of the commercial quota to  fishermen. Fishermen may harvest their quotas whenever they choose to do  so and must report their harvest.&#160;The 2012 Regulatory Amendment to Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper eliminated the October-December closed recreational fishing season, increased the commercial and recreational quotas, and maintained the individual fishing quota program for the commercial sector (SEDAR 31 2013). Although a variety of minimum size regulations have been implemented to help rebuild the population, this may not be an efficient method because of the high discard mortality (Deleveaux 2012).<br/><br/>In the mid-1990s, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) were used to limit the bycatch of juveniles in the shrimp trawl fishery (SEDAR 31 2013). While the BRDs did not appear to reduce juvenile bycatch to the expected degree, shrimp fishing effort has been reduced substantially since 2002, which may be improving survival probabilities for juveniles in some areas (Cowan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Porch 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Red Snapper caught in the Madison Swanson Marine Reserve (northeastern Gulf of Mexico) are significantly larger and older than those caught outside the reserve and there appears to be a spill-over effect to nearby locations (Koenig and Coleman 2013).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong><em>U.S. Atlantic</em><br/></strong>To address overfishing of Red Snapper in the southeast U.S., the Council developed Amendment 17A to the Snapper-Grouper Management Plan. The final rule implemented the following in 2010: prohibit all harvest and possession of red snapper in federal waters of the South Atlantic and in state waters for vessels holding federal snapper-grouper permits; require the use of circle hooks in the snapper-grouper fishery in federal waters north of 28 latitude; and require a program to monitor red snapper. As a result of these measures, the population has begun to increase since 2010. The Red Snapper is currently managed under a rebuilding plan whereby the South Atlantic Council established a process for a short season opening each year as long as total mortality (removals and discard mortality) is below the Acceptable Biological Catch (G. Waugh pers. comm. 2015). Red Snapper inhabit multiple MPAs under several designations established by the SAFMC in the southeast Atlantic coast. &#160;<br/><strong><br/><em>Mexico</em><br/></strong>Off Mexico, access to the commercial snapper fishery is controlled through permits and gear type is restricted to increase intraspecific selectivity. Management recommendations call for&#160;reductions of at least 30% in fishing mortality off the states of Yucatan, Campeche and Veracruz and to reduce the sale of fishing licenses&#160;off Tampico, Quintana Roo and Tabasco (SAGARPA 2012).&#160;It is also recommended to introduce the use of appropriate bycatch reduction devices in shrimp trawls, issue permits specific to the resource, evaluate the effectiveness of these measures, and establish benchmarks for management plans (SAGARPA 2012). A stock assessment document on the Mexican population would be extremely valuable for comparison to the SEDAR documents and other research from the northern Gulf of Mexico and US Atlantic coast.","",,false,false,Global

However, it is dependent upon <em>Acropora</em>&#160;coral reefs as its only food source, and is therefore highly susceptible to habitat loss. It has reportedly undergone local extinctions in Okinawa, Japan due to habitat loss. Of the 167&#160;<em>Acropora</em>&#160;species occurring in the Indo-Pacific, 51 (30%) are listed in a threatened category (Vulnerable or Endangered), and another 23 (13%) are Near Threatened. This species is also highly sought after for the aquarium trade in some parts of its range, but little is known on the impact from this threat. Due to its direct dependency on&#160;<em>Acropora&#160;</em>reefs, we infer that&#160;<em>O. longirostris</em>&#160;may experience projected population declines of at least 30% over the next three generations. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c. Research and monitoring is needed on the status of its population.","<em>Oxymonacanthus longirostris</em> occurs in clear lagoon and seaward reefs. It nests near bases of dead corals, often on clumps of algae. It feeds exclusively on <em>Acropora</em> polyps. Feeding takes place throughout the day becoming less towards the evening (Barlow 1987). The maximum length recorded is 12 cm total length (TL) (Lieske and Myers 1994). Most individuals live no more than two years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, we infer that ten years is greater than three generation lengths.<br/><br/>It is a monogamous species (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001, Whiteman and Côté 2004). It lives in an exclusive and heterosexual pair, with the male and female sharing the same territory to feed. Aggression is used commonly in courtship. Spawning commences when after swimming together in different tufts, the female concentrates on just one and begins to thrust repeatedly and pause. The male follows suit nuzzling the female. The female then drops into the algae and spawns, while the male releases the sperm beside her. The pair then swims back to their territory (Barlow 1987). This species produces between 200 and 300 eggs per clutch (Barlow 1987).<br/><br/>Coral bleaching can rapidly affect this corallivorous species. At one site of Okinawa Island (Japan), the growth rates of adults during the 1998 coral bleaching event were significantly lower than those measured in 1997. Tagged harlequin filefish were found to disappear at rates significantly higher than in previous years and no individuals (juvenile, young or adult) observed in March 1999 (Kokita and Nakazono 2001). As this species exhibits strong site fidelity and the abundance nearby did not noticeably increase, it was presumed that the individuals died in response to the bleaching event (Kokita and Nakazono 2001). Similarly, at Cousine Island (the Seychelles), this species declined rapidly after extensive coral mortality in 1998 from a mean of 6.4 individuals per count in 1997 to 0.0 individuals per count in 1999 (Spalding and Jarvis 2002). Kokita and Nakazono (2001) concluded that the occurrence of healthy acroporid corals, which appear to be particularly susceptible to coral bleaching is essential to the survival of this species in the wild.","<p>Because of its dependency on <em>Acropora </em>reefs, <em>O. longirostris</em> is susceptible to population declines due to habitat loss in parts of its range. As of 2008, 15% of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and South-east Asia among the most threatened (Wilkinson and Souter 2008). &#160;Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Of the 167&#160;<em>Acropora</em>&#160;species occurring in the Indo-Pacific, 51 (30%) are listed in a threatened category (Vulnerable or Endangered), and another 23 (13%) are Near Threatened. In 1998, an extensive bleaching event was observed in reef areas worldwide. This event severely impacted the fringing reefs of Bise, off the northwest coast of Okinawa, Japan, with most of the living coral dying and filamentous algae quickly covering the dead corals. Of all species, acroporid corals seemed the most susceptible to bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg and Salvat 1995,&#160;McClanahan 2000).&#160;</p>According to a leading expert in aquarium-related fishes,&#160;<em>O. longirostris</em>&#160;is one of the most difficult ornamental fishes to keep alive in captivity (Michael 1999), yet data from the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, and the&#160;Marine Aquarium Database (GMAD) which was assembled in 2000, indicate&#160;<em>O. longirostris</em>&#160;is one of, if not the, most heavily traded fishes that have been classified as most unsuitable for maintenance in aquaria (Wabnitz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Reports in the database indicate that 1,393 individuals of Harlequin filefish were traded between the years of 1999-2002, but reports by exporters between the same time period indicate that nearly 16,000 individuals were exported. High collection rates of this fish for the aquarium trade in addition to the higher frequency of natural disaster events such as bleaching observed in recent years may genuinely put at risk local populations and drive stocks below their critical recovery level (Kokita and Nakazono 1999, Kokita and Nakazono 2001).","<em>Oxymonacanthus longirostris</em>&#160;is a common inhabitant of shallow coral reefs in the Indo-West Pacific (Matsuura 1984). This species has reportedly undergone local extinction in Okinawa, Japan due to habitat loss (Hawkins&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).

Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but could be high; at vessel mortality for the congener, Owston's Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus owstoni</em>), was found to be 80% (Ellis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160; <br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004).&#160;A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region. Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2005). <br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, deep-water sharks are regularly reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Finucci&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Between 2008–2013, the Knifetooth Dogfish was not recorded in any commercial records (Francis 2015); the species may be recorded under a generic ""deep-water shark"" reporting code, however, reporting of deep-water shark catch to the species level has improved considerably with the introduction of identification guides (McMillan <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>","Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (111 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis of the relative abundance estimates from Spanish Porcupine Bank trawl surveys in the from 2001 to 2018 (ICES-WGEF 2018) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.1%, consistent with an estimated increase of 423.2% over three generation lengths (111 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the past three generation lengths.&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Knifetooth Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In New Zealand, the species is known from only a handful of records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;The gill and tanglenet fishery, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/02/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, this species is very common in markets throughout the country and caught by trawls and demersal gillnets (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply in Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Indonesian Sharpnose Ray (26 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 59–84%.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and&#160; research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Dwarf Whiprays in Indonesia is 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (26 years) (Krajangdara 2019). There is a large amount of illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Indonesian Sharpnose Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Indonesian Sharpnose Ray has undergone a 30–49% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (26 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Indonesian Sharpnose Ray occurs in the Indo-West Pacific from Indonesia to Thailand (Last<em> et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019).",<p>The flesh of the Indonesian Sharpnose Ray is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption throughout its range (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). <br/></p>,Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 marine protected areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.</p><p><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

Spawning aggregations are heavily exploited by artisanal fisheries, and declines are either documented or suspected in Saudi Arabia, Eritrea and Sudan since the mid-1990s. There are some protected areas, but conservation measures to reduce fishing pressure are not sufficient to prevent further declines. Therefore, this species is estimated to have undergone global-level declines of at least 30%, or possibly more, since 1995, which is a time period covering the past two generation lengths (24 years), and this decline is expected to continue in to the future over the next generation length (12 years) due to insufficient fisheries management and continued fishing pressure. It is listed as Vulnerable A4bd with a strong recommendation to reduce fishing pressure overall, especially on spawning aggregations.","This species is strongly coral reef-associated and is uncommonly found in shallow lagoon and seaward reefs. Its maximum total length is 120 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993). This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite that forms spawning aggregations. There is a single major annual reproductive period in the central Red Sea. Females reach sexual maturity at a total length of 57.2 cm and males at 61.4 cm and the estimated natural mortality is 0.21-0.23 year<sup>-1</sup> (Elamin 2012). It can attain a maximum age of 19 years and the age at first maturity is 4.6 years&#160;(DesRosiers 2011, Elamin 2012). Based on a longevity of 19 years, age of first maturity of 4.6 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 12 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species, and targeted effort on spawning aggregations causes rapid population declines (Elamin 2012, H. Choat pers. comm. 2018).","This species is rare to uncommon along the eastern Red Sea coast, but it is naturally relatively abundant on the west coast (e.g., Sudan). Its density during underwater surveys conducted in central&#160;Saudi Arabia was 0.47 individuals&#160;per 1,000 m² as compared to 2.91 individuals per 1,000 m² in Sudan (R. Cole pers. comm). Differences in abundance appear to be habitat related, although, it also may be attributed to fishing pressure occurring on coastal reefs of Sudan (M. Berumen pers. comm). However, underwater surveys conducted along the coast of Sudan in 2007 recorded very low numbers of this species, with zero sightings at 24 out of 36 sites (Equipe Cousteau 2008). Extensive underwater surveys conducted in 2014 did not record it from Djibouti, Socotra or western Oman (H. Choat and M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2018).&#160;An underwater survey conducted off Egypt in the Red Sea at seven sites between 3-10 metres depth from 2001 to 2003,&#160;did not observe this species (Leujak 2006). According to underwater surveys conducted in 2013, it appears to be virtually absent from the Gulf of Aqaba (H. Choat pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>According to fisher interviews, declines have occurred in some areas. It is virtually absent from Eritrea, which may be due to heavy fishing there. In Saudi Arabia, catch of this species is highest in the northern and central areas, particularly by the handline fishery (79.6% of production) with gill nets and traps representing about 1% of the catch. This is the most abundant epinephelid species in the Jeddah market. Official fisheries statistics reported by Saudi Arabia from 1995-2002 show that catch and catch per unit effort of this species in the handline fishery was stable over time with an annual average of 304 tonnes, which represented 2.3% of total catch of fish in Saudi Arabia (Red Sea only; Fallatah 2005). However,&#160;there has been a&#160;gradual catch decline in northern and central areas and an increase in southern areas of Saudi Arabia; although, in the southern area, this species is frequently confused with <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>, so catches may be mis-reported there. A spawning season fishing closure during 1994-2001&#160;reduced effort and catch&#160;(Fallatah 2005). Its current status in Saudi Arabia is not known. In Sudan, this species has been heavily targeted, especially during spawning aggregation season, since at least the mid-1990s; as a result, it is considered overfished. In addition, immature individuals comprise a significant portion of the catch, which is contributing to growth overfishing (Elamin 2012).&#160;Estimated landings of&#160;<em>Plectropomus areolatus </em>and <em>P. marisrubri</em>&#160;in the Sudanese fishery declined by 50-60% from 80 tonnes in 1999 to 40 t in 2010.

Males may spawn in their first year but females do not spawn until their second year (Berra 1984). Australian Grayling grows to about 300 mm total length. Throughout its range, the Australian Grayling is known to occur at elevations up to 700 m asl and is able to move large distances inland (Koster and Raadik 2010). Recent acoustic telemetry studies (Koster <em>et al. </em>2013, Amtstaetter <em>et al.</em> 2015) demonstrate the existence of a rapid, long-distance migration (often more than 40 km) from freshwater reaches to spawning grounds in the lower reaches immediately upstream of the estuary. These migrations occur in autumn and are initiated in response to increases in river flow (Koster <em>et al.</em> 2013, Amtstaetter <em>et al. </em>2015). Following downstream migration, most individuals return upstream to the area they previously occupied, suggesting homing behaviour and an attachment to a precise locality during the non-migratory phase (Koster <em>et al.</em> 2013). A recent radio-telemetry study of the day-to-day activity and habitat use of Australian Grayling in the Bunyip River, Victoria, also revealed that most of them occupied restricted (i.e. tens to hundreds of metres) reaches of stream during the non-spawning period and displayed diel patterns in localised movements, moving greater distances at night than during the day (Dawson and Koster 2018).</p><p>  </p><p><br/></p><p>  <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>Australian Grayling has declined dramatically since European settlement.

Reduced flows which&#160;increase periods of estuary mouth closure have the potential to impede access of drifting eggs and larvae to the sea, and migration of juveniles from the sea back into freshwater. <span>Projections of increased drought along the east coast of Australia raise concerns about the loss of spawning migration cues for adults and reduced outflow that might result in fewer juvenile fish being attracted to river mouths.&#160;Increased southward penetration of the East Australian current due to climate change could impact on populations by sweeping larvae southward during the marine phase of the life cycle and limiting recruitment into rivers in the northern parts of its range (NSW DPI 2015). Increasing urban development and associated&#160;changes in hydrology and habitat conditions are also a threat in some localities (e.g. Cardinia Creek near Melbourne). Predation of juvenile Australian Grayling by invasive Brown Trout has been recorded in coastal streams in Victoria (T. Raadik pers. comm. 2019). <span>Currently, and into the future, it is predicted that there is a very low likelihood of spawning and recruitment of Australian Grayling in highly regulated and flow-stressed rivers such as the&#160;Latrobe River and Yarra River (Shenton<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2014).

The species inhabits inshore sandy and rocky habitats to a depth of 35 m and little is known of its biology. The Brown Shyshark is a bycatch of trawl, and commercial and recreational line fisheries, and is subjected to habitat degradation due to coastal development. Trend analysis of angler surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area estimated population reductions of 57% over the past three generation lengths (60 years), although there was a high level of uncertainty in this estimate. Overall, due to estimated declines over part of its range, its limited  inshore distribution that is exposed to habitat degradation, and  potential levels of exploitation across its range, it is suspected  that  the Brown Shyshark&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%  over  the past three generations (60 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Brown Shyshark is demersal in inshore shallow areas, with a preference for sandy and rocky habitats, to a depth of  35 m (Human 2007, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It reaches a maximum size of 69 cm total length (TL),  males mature at 55 cm TL and females mature at 61 cm (Human 2007, Ebert <em>et al.</em>  2013). Reproduction is oviparous with egg cases laid in pairs (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to  age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip  Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity  of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15  years (Liu <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is smaller than  the Brown Shyshark (48 cm vs 69 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size,  the generation length is inferred as 20 years for the Brown Shyshark.","The Brown Shyshark is bycatch of trawl fisheries, and commercial and recreational line fisheries (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). Trawl fishing effort in South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Shore line fishing effort has decreased over the last 16 years as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches. Although the Brown Shyshark is discarded, many fishers regard the species as a nuisance and persecute them as such, likely causing high post-release mortality (Human 2009, K. Gledhill, unpubl. data, 2018). When discarded without undue harm, post-release mortality is likely low, based on generally very low at-vessel and post-release mortality for catsharks (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species is sometimes caught for the aquarium trade, but there are no known target fisheries for this purpose (Human 2007). Habitat degradation is likely an issue for this catshark due to its inshore nature and the high level of coastal development occurring within its range, and it is suspected that this has caused a decline in the quality of habitat.","There are no estimates of population size for the Brown Shyshark. Population trend data of standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) (number of fish per angler per day) for 1996–2017 (22 years) were available from the De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA) shore-based research angling surveys conducted by the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 57.0% over the past three generation lengths (60 years), with the  highest  probability (41.3%) of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths but also with a high probability (36.3%) of  &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. The 22 years of CPUE data fluctuated greatly and led to a high degree of uncertainty in the modelled abundance index, and also required extrapolation to a long period of three generations (60 years). This combined to produce a probability distribution with contrasting high probabilities of extinction risk. The De Hoop MPA was established in 1985 and is a no-take reserve, and the population trend is indicative only and may not be representative of the trends in fished areas of South Africa. However, currently there are no other data available to assess population trends.&#160;<br/><br/>Overall, due to estimated declines over part of its range, its limited inshore distribution range that is exposed to habitat degradation, and levels of exploitation across its range, it is suspected  that the Brown Shyshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%  over the past three generations (60 years).",Decreasing,"The Brown Shyshark is endemic to South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans from False Bay, Western Cape to Durban  (Human 2009, M.

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016). <br/></span>","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Barbeled Houndshark that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Barbeled Houndshark still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, while species-specific information is not available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically very abundant but that targeted fisheries led to severe declines in quantities landed. The species is still captured as bycatch in targeted fisheries for 'tollo' generally consisting of the Common Smoothhood (<em>Mustelus mustelus</em>) and the Barbeled Houndshark. However, annual fisheries statistics from the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches collected since 2010, indicate that landings declined from 299 t in 2010 to 17 t in 2018 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). On the other hand, experimental fishing surveys indicate that catches have increased over the last decade (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004 and 2006, this species was present in 8.3% of the total catches and contributed 0.2% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). Two individuals were also recorded during research trawl surveys carried out between 2007–2010 in Mauritanian waters, representing 0.01% of occurrence (ratio of number of fishing hauls in which the species occurred) (Pascual-Alayon <em>et al</em>. 2017). Between 2004–2011, this species was recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region in most countries except for The Gambia, Cape Verde, and Sierra Leone and was considered very abundant (Diop and Dossa 2011, M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). There has been no recent records of this species in landing site surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, two individuals were recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010–2018 (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Cape Verde, the species was recorded during Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys undertaken between 2015–2017 with one individual sighted in 220 hours of underwater video footage (S. Pires, S. Ratao unpubl. data 2020). The species is likely caught in artisanal fisheries across the archipelago but landings quantities are not available because data are aggregated with other species such as the Common Smoothhound, Atlantic Weasel Shark (<em>Paragaleus pectoralis</em>), and the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>). There, it is targeted for cação (dried shark meat) which has replaced imported cod from Portugal and has resulted in increased targeted shark fisheries (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2018). It was recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012, but data on quantities are not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). There have been no records of this species in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 or in Nigeria during regular fisheries research surveys (K. Metcalfe, A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, it was not recorded in landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 despite other species of sharks with similar catchability like the Common Smoothhound being recorded (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to eight individuals representing 0.06% of catches in one haul captured from Guinea to Morocco, and two individuals representing 2.97% of catches in one haul captured Nigeria in 2004 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species represented up to 10.3% of sharks captured in 2016, 25.6% in 2017, 41.9% in 2018 and 34.7% in 2019 (with variations in catches over the years likely due to differences in the presence of onboard observers and spatial regulations in process) but these data were mostly aggregated with the Common Smoothhound while there are no records of this species from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). It was also not detected in the Republic of the Congo during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019, despite having been reported as common in the past (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005), and in Cameroon in over two years of landing site between 2018–2020 (P. Doherty, A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, two individuals were recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (A.L.

There are no other known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the region have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Barbeled Houndshark are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K.

Small numbers have been taken in directed inshore fisheries for small sharks and the species has been sporadically utilized for its flesh in southern KwaZulu-Natal. It may also be a possible bycatch of inshore fisheries, but details are lacking. The species is caught by sports surf anglers and recreational boat anglers, particularly along the  Lower South Coast and Upper Transkei (K. Cox, pers. comm., 2018). Most competitive recreational anglers release elasmobranchs after weighing (Pradervand <em>et al</em>. 2007), but the level of post-release mortality is unknown and potentially high.

It inhabits shallow coastal inshore and rocky and coral reef habitats to depths of 90 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption. Reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Bangladesh, Malaysia, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 27–88% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) of the Slender Bambooshark. Further, a population reduction of 31% was inferred for the Slender Bambooshark based on a 50% decrease in fisheries-independent research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs (all species combined) between 1978–80 and 2013 in Myanmar. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of elasmobranchs in the region. Fishing pressure is high across much of the spatial and depth range of this species yet it is still commonly landed in parts of its range. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of the Slender Bambooshark. Alternatively, the increase in landings may imply some resilience to, or refuge from, fishing pressure. The rocky habitat and inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure.<em> </em>It is suspected that the Slender Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (18 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","<p>The Slender Bambooshark occurs in shallow inshore habitats including intertidal pools, rocky and coral reefs to depths of 90 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It may possibly occur in fresh water in the lower reaches of the Perak River in peninsular Malaysia (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species reaches a maximum size of 65 cm total length (TL), males mature at 39–42 cm TL and females mature at 43 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is oviparous with individuals hatching at less than 13 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Bamboosharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Whitespotted Bambooshark (<em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 4.5 years and maximum age of 14, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The Whitespotted Bambooshark is larger than the Slender Bambooshark (95 cm vs 65 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 6 years for the Slender Bambooshark.</p>","<p>The Slender Bambooshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is regularly taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet and line, and retained for human consumption (SEAFDEC 2016, Psomadakis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>India has&#160;an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters throughout the Bay of Bengal (&gt;23,000; K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across southeast Asia (Karnad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;There is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020a). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that has been increasing in recent decades with 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in 2017–2018 (DoF 2018, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The artisanal fishing fleet operates at depths of 0–40 m on average but can operate down to 80 m (Hoq et al. 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 t in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p><p>In Myanmar, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Andaman Sea, there has been a shift to smaller, fast-growing, and productive sharks where <em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp. comprise 65% of the landings in the Ranong province of Thailand (Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). A 165% increase in fishers occurred from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise a high majority (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Slender Bambooshark. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-orientated economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020b).</p><p>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In Viet Nam, dynamite and&#160;cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, FAO 2020b).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific trend information for the Slender Bambooshark. The species is currently commonly landed in Bangladesh with 10–20 individuals observed each day at landing sites (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Monitoring of fish landing sites in Southeast Asia have shown that the relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades due to declines in large sharks and increased targeting and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and&#160;Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Lack and Sant 2012, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Bangladesh, Malaysia, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;</p><p>In India, this species was historically very common, found at landing sites in all coastal states of India, but is now uncommon or absent from landings (Joshi <em>et al. </em>2008). There are estimates of catches totalling 12 individuals per month at Cochin Fisheries Harbor, a major shark landing hub of Kerala during 2000–2002 (Joshi <em>et al. </em>2008). Market surveys during 2008–2019 did not record any individuals of this species at Cochin Fisheries Harbor, Kerala or the other coastal fishing states, indicating drastic population declines (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid 1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>In Myanmar, reconstructed catch data, from 1950 to the late 1990s, varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs over the 33 years between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013 and a shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species (Krakstad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Market surveys reveal a decline in landings of 49% over a four-year period (2006–2010) despite no reduction in fishing effort and increasing domination by small, short-lived species (San San Khine 2010). In Malaysia, the relative proportion of bamboosharks (<em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp.) in landings has doubled over recent years (Arshad <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Lack and Sant 2012, SEAFDEC 2016).&#160;Reconstructed shark and ray catches declined by 30% on the east coast of Malaysia from 1999 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Similarly, on the west coast of Malaysia, reconstructed catches declined by 18% over the same period. These declines can be inferred to represent shark and ray population reductions, as fishing effort was increasing during the period of declines in catch (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Gulf of Thailand, reconstructed shark and ray catch showed a 74% decline over 12 years from 2003 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Historically, catches fluctuated since 1950–1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.</p><p>In Indonesia, net and trawl fisheries (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Slender Bambooshark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). This species is uncommon compared to other bamboosharks in the area (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Viet Nam, reconstructed shark and ray catch declined by 97% over 29 years from 1986 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in catch (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In China, reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p><p>When these reconstructed catch declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Slender Bambooshark (18 years) they represent declines of 41%, 29%, 88%, and 27% in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Viet Nam, and China, respectively. In Myanmar, a population reduction of 31% was inferred based on a 50% decrease in research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region and the Slender Bambooshark may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks. The species is considered common in Bangladesh but is uncommon in Indonesia. This species may have some refuge from fishing activity in rocky habitats throughout its range. Overall, it is suspected that the Slender Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (18 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Slender Bambooshark occurs in the Eastern and Western Indian, Western Central Pacific, and Northwest Pacific Oceans. It has a patchy distribution from India to China, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia (western), Thailand, and Viet Nam (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Roy <em>et al. </em>2013, Arai and Azri 2019, Psomadakis <em>et al. </em>2019). The species also possibly occurs across further north to Korea and Japan and further east across Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and to the Solomon Islands (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>The species is used for its low-value meat for local consumption (SEAFDEC 2016). In Bangladesh, species of the genus <em>Chiloscyllium </em>are often landed and sold to crocodile farmers as animal feed (A.B.

In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 02/04/2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnes are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al.</em> 1987).</p><p>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East and South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019).

The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of the Grey Bambooshark. Alternatively, the increase in landings may imply some resilience to, or refuge from, fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Grey Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","<p>The Grey Bambooshark occurs in shallow inshore habitats including rocky and coral reefs at depths of 5–100 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). This species reaches a maximum size of 77 cm total length (TL), males mature at 45–55 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is oviparous with individuals hatching at less than 12 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Bamboosharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Whitespotted Bambooshark (<em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 4.5 years and maximum age of 14, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The Whitespotted Bambooshark is larger than the Grey Bambooshark (95 cm vs 77 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 7 years for the Grey Bambooshark.</p>","<p>The Grey Bambooshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range.&#160;It is regularly taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet and line, and retained for human consumption (SEAFDEC 2016, Psomadakis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across southeast Asia (Karnad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk46923857"">There is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020).</a> There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>In Bangladesh, there continues to be extensive fishing activity throughout all coastal habitats with artisanal fisheries operating at depths of 0–40 m on average but can operate down to 80 m (Hoq et al. 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 tonnes (t) in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Artisanal fishing effort in Bangladesh rapidly increased four-fold from 143,000 kilowatt hours (kW) in 2000 to 582,000 kW in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in Bangladesh (DoF 2018).</p><p>In Myanmar, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Andaman Sea, there has been a shift to smaller, fast-growing, and productive sharks where <em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp. comprise 65% of the landings in the Ranong province of Thailand (Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An indirect threat is the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves. Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific trend information for the Grey Bambooshark. Monitoring of fish landing sites in Southeast Asia reveals that the relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades due to declines in large sharks and increased targeting and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and&#160;Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Lack and Sant 2012, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In India, this species is commonly found in landings and it is taken as retained bycatch with bottom trawls, gillnets, and beach seines. Joshi <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimated the number of individuals landed during 2000–2002 was eight specimens per month at Cochin Fisheries Harbor, Kerala. This species is still common but is landed in fewer numbers compared to 2008–2010 period due to a reduced catch rate (K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Population declines are inferred from intensive trawling in shallow depth areas in the Eastern Indian Ocean.</p><p>Elsewhere, despite the lack of species-specific trend data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Thailand Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>In Myanmar, estimates of shark and ray landings, from 1950 to the late 1990s, varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 tonnes with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. Trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs over the 33 years between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013 and a shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species (Krakstad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). For a species with a three-generation span of 21 years this equates to a population reduction of 35%. Market surveys reveal a decline in landings 49% over a four-year period (2006–2010) despite no reduction in fishing effort and increasing domination by small short-lived species (San San Khine 2010).</p><p>In Malaysia, monitoring of fish landing sites has shown that the relative proportion of bamboosharks (<em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp.) in landings has doubled over recent years (Arshad <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Lack and Sant 2012, SEAFDEC 2016).&#160;Overall, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays and skates declined by 30% on the east coast of Malaysia between 1999 and 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Similarly, on the west coast of Malaysia, shark and ray catches declined by 18% over the same period. These declines can be inferred to represent population reductions, as fishing effort was increasing during the period of declines in catch (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Gulf of Thailand, catches of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 74% decline over 12 years from 2003 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Historically, catches fluctuated since 1950–1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.</p><p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Grey Bambooshark (21 years) they represent declines of 46% and 41% in Bangladesh and Malaysia, respectively. In Myanmar, a population reduction of 35% was inferred based on a 50% reduction in research survey catch rate of bulk elasmobranchs between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased over recent decades and the Grey Bambooshark may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks. It is still commonly landed in India, although catch rates have reduced. Overall, it is suspected that the Grey Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (21 years)&#160;based on actual levels of exploitation.</p>",Decreasing,"The Grey Bambooshark occurs in the Eastern and Western Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans. It has a patchy distribution from Pakistan to Thailand, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Malaysia. (Hoq <em>et al. </em>2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Psomadakis <em>et al. </em>2019). The species also possibly occurs across further north to Viet Nam and China and further east across Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","<p>The species is used for its low-value meat for local consumption (SEAFDEC 2016). In Bangladesh, species of the genus <em>Chiloscyllium </em>are often landed and sold to crocodile farmers as animal feed (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures currently in place. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 02/04/2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnes are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Grey Bambooshark, and catch rates should be monitored.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore waters on the insular and continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 170 m. This species is subject to intense fishing effort throughout its geographic and depth range. It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl and gillnet. The meat is consumed locally and traded internationally or used for fish meal production. Reconstructed catches of combined requiem sharks across the Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea infer a population reduction of 42% over three generation lengths (27 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. It is suspected that the Sicklefin Weasel Shark&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed Vulnerable A2d.","The Sicklefin Weasel Shark is demersal on the continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 170 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 114 cm total length (TL), males mature at 72–91 cm TL and females mature at ~85 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013)., Reproduction is viviparous with litter size of 2–4 pups, possibly two litters per year and size-at-birth of 26–28 cm TL (White 2007, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). There is no information on the species' age-at-maturity and maximum age hence, generation length was inferred based on data for&#160;the Whiskery Shark (<em>Furgaleus macki</em>), which reaches a similar maximum size (120 cm TL), thus generation length was inferred to be 9 years<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>(Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2000).","Throughout its distribution, the Sicklefin Weasel Shark is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020b). Juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years. About 6,600 trawlers are operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t per year from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hour in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast (Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20–25 days (NARA 2003).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased by nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of its fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). All bycatch in Malaysia is retained for the meat for human consumption, for bait in traps or for fish meal production for aquaculture. Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; There has been and is still currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated to the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is commercially valuable, with most specimens caught as bycatch landed and sold for meat. The meat is consumed locally either fresh or dried and salted (FAO 2011). Intensive trawl and gillnetting occurs throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operate throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpub. data 2020). Thus, the level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Sicklefin Weasel Shark is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The Sicklefin Weasel Shark is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020a). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh et al. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen 1997). Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. In Taiwan, the number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Demersla trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Wagey <em>et al</em>. 2017). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There are no species-specific time-series data available. In Malaysia, the Sicklefin Weasel Shark was among the top ten most commonly taken species in the early 2000s but not among the top ten species by 2016 (SEAFDEC 2006, SEAFDEC 2016). It is commonly observed at markets in peninsular Malaysia and is less common in Sabah and Sarawak (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Reconstructed catches of related species are available at the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale, i.e., Carcharhinidae, <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and Triakidae (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The aggregate catch of these closely related species are available from LMEs 35–38 (i.e., Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea). Catch levels of these species rose rapidly through the 1970s to a peak of 63,186 t in 1989. Catch then declined to 32,822 t in 2016 representing a 48% decline over 27 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>These declines equate to a population reduction of 42% over three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. It is suspected that the Sicklefin Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to actual levels of exploitation.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Sicklefin Weasel Shark has a patchy distribution in the Indian, Western Central, and Northwest Pacific Oceans where it occurs from India to Taiwan and possibly in the Red Sea (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). This species is included in checklists within the Red Sea region, however, it has not been observed in recent surveys (Spaet <em>et al.</em> 2015, Spaet <em>et al.</em> 2016), nor has it been caught by fishermen recently (J.L.Y. Spaet unpubl. data 2020).","The meat is used for human consumption fresh or salted and dried. Heads and other discarded parts may be used as fish bait in traps (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In some cases, shark jaws and teeth are cleaned and sold as souvenirs (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2006). In Malaysia, small sharks, such as this species, are sent to fish mill factories and used for fertilizer (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2006).",Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004,two shark reserves were established in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) from the shore (DoF 2015).<br/><br/>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia, there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² and in Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² and this species may occur in the MPAs (CTI 2020). However, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983, in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020c). These bans and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on ""muro ami"" gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020c). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer et al. 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance are limited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a). In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon et al. 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao et al. 2019). There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nm of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 GT (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao et al. 2019). In China, in response to the fish stock depletion, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019)<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 150–350 m. The species is currently only known from 10 specimens and is a rare bycatch of demersal trawl fisheries that is discarded in Japan and retained in Taiwan. Post-release survival may be high.<br/><br/>The fisheries in Japan overlap with the full spatial and depth range of this species, and although they have declined dramatically in effort over the past three decades (1.5 generation lengths), the species may have been subject to high fishing pressure over the past three generation lengths (60 years). Other deep-water species  have exhibited population declines in the species' Japanese range.<em> Oxynotus </em>species are highly  susceptible to population decline  from  fishing with estimated population reductions of 80% over three generation  lengths (60 years) in areas with high  fishing effort. The entire known spatial range of the Japanese Roughshark is subject to ongoing  fishing pressure which, combined with declines in other deep-water  species in the region, and a precautionary approach leads to it being suspected that the Japanese Roughshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Japanese Roughshark is demersal on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 150–350 m (Ho and Nakaya 2016, Weigmann 2016). It seems to prefer sandy or muddy habitats (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). The species reaches a known maximum size of 64.5 cm total length (TL), males are mature by 54 cm TL and females are mature by 59 cm TL (Yano 2004, Ho and Nakaya 2016). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Productivity is assumed to be low as for other <em>Oxynotus </em>spp. (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008, Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2016). Age parameters are unknown and are inferred from another species in the family Squalidae, the Shortnose Spurdog (<em>Squalus megalop</em>s) which has a female age-at-maturity of 19 years and a maximum age of 25 years, resulting in a generation length of 19.5 years (Rigby <em>et al.</em> 2016). This is similar to the generation length of 20 years that has been estimated for other <em>Oxynotus</em> spp. (Soldo and Guallart 2015).","The Japanese Roughshark is a rare bycatch of demersal trawl fisheries in Suruga Bay and Enshu-nada Sea, Japan and off Da-xi, northeast Taiwan (Yano 2004, Ho and Nakaya 2016). Japanese commercial demersal trawl fisheries operate to depths of ~700 m and discard the bycatch (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Limited information suggests the species may have high post-release survival (Koehler 2018). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>The species may be a bycatch of Taiwan deep-water trawl fisheries that mostly operate at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D. Ebert pers. comm. 28/08/2019).  However, only one specimen has been recorded from Taiwan, from the Da-xi fish markets and was trawled on the slope near Kueishan Island at ~300 m (Ho and Nakaya 2016). The trawl fishery out of Da-xi has moved into deeper waters over the past 30 years (from 1998–2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert pers. comm. 28/08/2019). During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Indonesia, the single specimen was found washed up on the beach (Wagey <em>et al.</em> 2017).","<p>No data are available on population trends for the Japanese Roughshark. The species is only known to date from ten specimens (Ho and Nakaya 2016, Wagey <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is distinctive morphologically, and it is uncertain whether it is being captured and not reported.<em> Oxynotus </em>species are highly susceptible to population decline  from  fishing, and populations in the Mediterranean and Northeast  Atlantic  have declined by an estimated 80% over three generation  lengths (60 years), or  disappeared altogether, in areas with high  fishing effort (Soldo and  Guallart 2015, Soldo and Guallart 2016). Although there have been dramatic declines in trawl fishing pressure in Japan over the past three decades, this is equivalent to 1.5 generation lengths of the Japanese Roughshark, which implies that prior to this, over the past three generation lengths (60 years), the species has been subject to high fishing pressure in Japan and other deep-water species have exhibited population declines in Suruga Bay (Yano 2004). The species' entire known spatial range is subject to ongoing fishing pressure which combined with inferred low productivity and declines in other deep-water species in the species' Japanese range, and a precautionary approach leads to it being suspected that the Japanese Roughshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Japanese Roughshark has a patchy distribution in the Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific Oceans where it is known from Suruga Bay and Ie Island (Okinawa) Japan, from northeast Taiwan, and from Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (Ho and Nakaya 2016, Wagey <em>et al.</em> 2017).

The Pacific Guitarfish is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its range (including targeted fishing), with little refuge (except in some remote areas).<br/><br/>Overall, due to levels of exploitation from its exposure to inadequately managed fisheries throughout much of its range, it is suspected that the Pacific Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (15 years).</p>",Decreasing,The Pacific Guitarfish occurs from southern Mexico to northern Chile including the Galápagos&#160;Islands (Ecuador) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).,This guitarfish is retained and the meat is consumed or sold locally.,Marine,"There are no species-specific measures in place for the Pacific Guitarfish.&#160;In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.

Benthic trawling and mechanized beach seines have been prohibited in the coastal zone of Peru (to 5 nm from shore) since 2001 (Regulation: DS-012-2001-PE) and manual beach seines from 2009 (Regulation: RM-112-2009-PRODUCE ). This has likely reduced the catch of inshore elasmobranchs in Peruvian coastal waters. The Galápagos Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos&#160;Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).

Reproduction is oviparous with 6–11 egg cases per oviduct that are laid when they are close to hatching; it is unknown if both oviducts contain egg cases simultaneously (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the similar-sized Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in an inferred generation length of 15 years for the Tiger Catshsark (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011).","The Tiger Catshark is a discarded bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, beach seine, gillnet, and squid fisheries (Booth and Hecht 1998, Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). It is also caught in recreational line fisheries (van der Elst 1979, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fisheries operate throughout its range, but fishing effort in South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Intense trawl fishing exists in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013), although this accounts for only a minor part of this species' range. The Tiger Catshark has tended to move northeast within South Africa over three decades from 1981–2016, from the wide  shelf area of Agulhus Bank to the narrower shelf area to the east (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2019). This shift is concurrent with a reduction in the probability of encounter in the DAFF research trawl surveys (Supplementary Information Figure 2). The range shift and reduction in likelihood of encounter are likely at least partially related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al. </em>2010, Blamey <em>et al.</em> 2015), as the interaction with fisheries does not appear substantial enough to be causing the reduction (C. da Silva, unpubl. data, 2018). The range shift likely represents a significant loss of habitat to this species that has a restricted southern African distribution.","There are no estimates of population size for the Tiger Catshark. Population trend data of annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016) in fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (45 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019).

The species may inhabit depths beyond the reach of some regional fishing activities.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al.</em> 2017, Moore<em> et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/><br/> There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) and at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, there are&#160;demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus</em>&#160;spp.). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at depths of 100–400 m (Cervantes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), and in Morocco, there has been a fluctuating but increasing trend in deep-water shark landings from 0.2 t in 2007 to 17.8 t in 2017 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;<br/><br/> There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/> <br/> West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels <em>et al.</em> 2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable&#160;in the short term (FAO 2020).","There are no species-specific trend data for the African Sawtail Catshark. Across West Africa, total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950<span lang=""EN-CA"">–2010, while the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of artisanal and industrial vessels declined by 34% over this period (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Fishing effort is intensive across the species' known range. Reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates&#160;data are available  across its range and while&#160;these levels of declines are not  species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader  levels of decline in sharks in the region. For example, in Mauritania reconstructed&#160;landings of sharks, rays, and skates&#160;data&#160;showed&#160;an&#160;increase of&#160;246% from 1992 to 2015, and is reflective of increasing fishing effort (Pauly&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2020). In Senegal, the reconstructed landings data showed a&#160;decline of&#160;at least&#160;30%, and possibly as large as&#160;80% from 2001 to 2016.&#160;Landings increased from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972, peaked at&#160;23,194 t in 2001, and declined&#160;to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Angola, reconstructed landings data have risen since&#160;the 1950s, but show a&#160;61% decline between 2007 and 2016; landings peaked in 2007 at 17,015 t in 2007 and were 6,576 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Declines in landings in Senegal and Angola can be inferred to represent reductions&#160;in shark, ray, and skates populations, as fishing effort increased considerably during these periods.

Female age-at-maturity is 7.5 years and maximum age is 17.9 years, resulting in a generation length of 12.7 years (Chu 2012).","<p>The Oriental Stingaree is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries by trawl and gillnet and is retained for fish meal in Taiwan and China. It may be discarded in Japan and South Korea, although the capture still poses a threat because at-vessel-mortality of urolophid species ranges from 0–50% and abortion upon capture is typical of urolophid species and can lead to reduced population viability (Rigby <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Oriental Stingaree. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. 2</em>012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22884618"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011).</a> The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NMFT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019).&#160;</p>","<p>The Oriental Stingaree is considered common in Taiwan (Ysu 2007, Chu 2012, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), but nothing is known of its abundance elsewhere.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, in Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. <br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Oriental Stingaree (38 years), they represent declines of 72%, 93%, 48%, and 95%, in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.<br/><br/>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of the Oriental Stingaree. It may have some refuge from fishing pressure in inshore rocky habitats, and in parts of southern Japan where trawl pressure is decreasing. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may also afford the species some refuge. Overall, the species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (38 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Oriental Stingaree is endemic to the Northwest Pacific from southern Japan to Taiwan, including South Korea and China (Zhu and Meng 2001, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","The species is not used for human consumption in Taiwan and China, and likely Japan and South Korea, as the flesh has a high water content and the skin is covered in a lot of mucous. It is used for fish meal in Taiwan and China (H. Ho and J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).</a><br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al. </em>2019). Since the mid-2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). It may also be protected in parts of China where there are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019a) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). Research is needed on population size and trend, and catches should be monitored.<br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in on the continental shelf at depths of 0–75 m. Its meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range.<br/><br/>There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all elasmobranchs and whiprays across the region can be used to infer declines of 50–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The species is discarded and likely has high post-release survival in parts of the Arabian Sea. This species has minimal refuge from high fishing pressure, yet it is still commonly captured in some areas, which implies some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Longtail Butterfly Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (45 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.<em><em><br/></em></em>","<p>The Longtail Butterfly Ray is demersal on inshore, sandy and muddy substrates at depths of 0–75 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 104 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~35 cm DW and females mature at ~41 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparity with litters of 1–7 pups and size-at-birth is 22–26 cm DW (James 1966, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Spontaneous abortion is, however, common in this species upon capture, which may confound the litter size determinations. It is thought to breed nearly year-round, with a peak in parturition between April and October (James 1966).&#160;Generation length is estimated from the Backwater Butterfly Ray (<em>Gymnura natalensis</em>) from South Africa that matures at 6 years and reaches a maximum age of 24, yielding a generation length of 15 years (van der Elst 1988). <br/></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Longtail Butterfly Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries for human consumption or fishmeal. In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China among the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 % annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a  major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant  2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch  is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside  Taiwan exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries  Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).&#160;By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal  fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into  offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) continued to  rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo  and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215  vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly  decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010,&#160; Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, H. Hsu  Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).  The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for  non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956–2004), but remains steady for  fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956–2004)  (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In  Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish  consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014,<strong> </strong>Helgil  2019).</p><p>There is intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020a). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In the Philippines, the fishing fleet rapidly expanded in the 1960s and  1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved  into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent  throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to  subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s  (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The commercial fleet operating in the  Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400  vessels) (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly  inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s  (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in  inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally  reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>  2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500  vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size  has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine  power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels  (Pauly<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). <br/></p><p>In Singapore, this species makes up ~2% of the rays landed (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). This species is commonly landed, particularly during the monsoon season (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;et al.&#160;2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years&#160;(Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many fishing vessels in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t(per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20<span class=""tlid-translation"">–25 days (NARA 2003).</span></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, the majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (two generation lengths). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently began (2 years) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses demersal set gillnets to catch up to 6 t of rays per trip (3<span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation"">–5 days). There are currently 20–40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006). <br/></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation"">The Longtail Butterfly Ray is reported in small numbers (&lt; 1% of  total elasmobranch landings) from Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain (Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012,  Moore and Peirce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates, this species was commonly caught in  research demersal trawl surveys but also represented less than 1% of  landed batoids by number observed during intensive landing site and  market surveys (R. W. Jabado pers. comm. 20/04/2017). In the Red Sea,  information on this species are limited to one report with no details of  catch numbers (Bonfil 2003). No records have been confirmed in more  recent market surveys from Sudan and the Saudi Arabian Red Sea (Spaet  and Berumen 2015), although this could be due to high levels of discards  of rays in the Red Sea region (e.g., Sudan and Eritrea (I. Elhassan  pers. comm. 07/02/2017))</span></span></span></span></p><p>In the Arabian Sea portion of its range, fishing pressure in places is intense and increasing. For example, in the Indian state of Gujarat, the number of trawlers increased from ~6,600 in 2004 to over 11,500 trawlers in 2010 (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004, CMFRI 2010). Similarly, gillnet fishing (including net length) is increasing in India (Bineesh K.K. unpubl. data 2017). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). In&#160;the Red Sea, the number of Saudi Arabian traditional vessels operating increased from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), while in Eritrea&#160;catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).&#160;In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting elasmobranch populations (Glaser&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Butterfly rays are generally discarded in the Red Sea and the Gulf (due to undesirable meat), in contrast to the normal retention in India. Survivorship from released line catches would be higher than trawl where the species may suffer mortality even if released.</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Marine habitats in the Arabian Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) which is likely to impact this species.</p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">D</a>espite the lack of species-specific data, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China Exclusive <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can  be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased  while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings from around 90,000 t  annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014.  This represents a reduction of 54% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Longtail Butterfly Ray (45 years). Fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p><p>In Taiwan, landings data&#160;are available on the combined catch of all ray species taken by bottom trawl in Da-xi, Yilan County. The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993 to 2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993–2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This infers a decline as fishing effort increased during the period and represents a  reduction of 99% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Longtail Butterfly Ray  (45 years). In Viet Nam,  reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates fshowed a 97% decline in landings  of sharks, rays, and skates from  1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per  year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the  early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady  decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al.  </em>2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be  inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing  effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing  during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This represents a  reduction of 99% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Longtail Butterfly Ray  (45 years).</p><p>Reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. Butterfly rays have similar ecological traits as whiprays and are likely to be caught in the same gears, thus this is an appropriate taxonomic group to help determine population trends. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years (a time-span of one generation length) despite increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, representing a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Longtail Butterfly Ray (45 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 79–96% in this butterfly ray.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and southern Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 tper year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). This butterfly ray is a dominant component of the ray catch in the Karimata Strait (R. Yuneni unpubl. data 2020). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Longtail Butterfly Ray in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (45 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (Krajangdara 2019). In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al. </em>2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. <br/></p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). All size classes of Longtail Butterfly Ray are caught and landed in Bangladesh including young-of-year and pregnant females. This is one of the most commonly landed species in southeast Bangladesh (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In Sri Lanka, approximately 75% of individuals landed of this species were mature (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Overall, reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “<em>it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion</em>” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005). The&#160;Longtail Butterfly Ray population is suspected to have declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg per hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg per hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).&#160;This is an ~95%&#160;decline over a period of three generation length (45 years) for the Longtail Butterfly Ray.&#160;Although this information is not species-specific,&#160;this provides an indication of overall ray declines as a result of heavy (and increasing) fishing pressure on the continental shelf in India (and likely reflects the situation in Pakistan). Ongoing fishing is suspected to result in continuing population declines in the future. Raje and Zacharia (2009) also report an increase in butterfly ray landings in Mumbai from 1990–92 to a peak in 1999–2001 with a drastic drop in 2002–04. Although this study reports these as&#160;<em>G. japonica</em>, this species is restricted to the Northwest Pacific, and these data could only refer to the Longtail Butterfly or the Tentacled Butterfly Ray (<em>Gymnura tentaculata</em>), the only two gymnurids found in the Arabian Sea (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), and most likely refer to the Longtail Butterfly Ray (as there are no recent records in the region of the Tentacled Butterfly Ray). In the Gulf, butterfly rays are often discarded alive, and such severe declines of this species are not expected in that part of the region.&#160;</p><p>There is a large amount of IUU fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in sharks, skates, and rays and whiprays of 30–99% over three generation lengths (45 years) can be considered representative of population reduction of the Longtail Butterfly Ray. This species is still commonly captured in parts of its range, which may indicate some resilience to fishing pressure. Overall, it is suspected that the Longtail Butterfly Ray has undergone a 30–49% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (45 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Longtail Butterfly Ray is found from the Red Sea and Arabian/Persian Gulf in the Western Indian Ocean through the Eastern Indian Ocean to the Philippines and north from Indonesia to southern Japan in the Northwest Pacific (Last <em>et al. </em>2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reports from locations outside this range require confirmation (Muktha <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The meat of the Longtail Butterfly Ray is consumed fresh or dried and salted. Its meat is valuable in Indonesia (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020) but sold at lower costs than other rays in Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, ray meat is consumed locally and exported. Smaller individuals are used for local consumption in tribal areas and coastal villages and larger individuals are exported or consumed locally. There has been some demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan and coastal areas and anecdotal information suggests in some restaurants (A.B Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, this species is used for its meat and as bait for longlines (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).&#160; In the Gulf of Oman, this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). In India, ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price.",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In China, in response to the fish stock depletions, the Chinese national  government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since  been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on  motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear  regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing  vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However,  non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues  to increase (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019).<a name=""_Hlk21689683""> In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which  cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas,  with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for accounting for 0.9% and  4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689697""></a>There  is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine  nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019).

Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been  banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual  removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government  assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency  2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices,  and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is  limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are at least three MPAs (Hon  Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine  area (FAO 2020).</p><p>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and  purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental  and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). These bans  and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and  Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby  trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within  municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1998, a ban was also  legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and  other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020).  Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use  Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries  Administrative Order 237 series of 2010 (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020),  which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer <em>et al.</em>  2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 MPAs (NFRDI 2017, CTI  2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection  including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural  Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 marine protected areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, two shark reserves were established in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020). <br/></p><p>The United Arab Emirates and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.</p>","",,false,false,Global

This skate is likely taken as bycatch in an apparently rapidly-developing foreign deepwater shrimp trawl  fishery that operates off the west coast of Madagascar in the  Mozambique Channel. There is no known market value and it is likely discarded, but survivorship from capture at such depths is likely to be extremely  low. This fishery intensified in 2017 without any known management  measures, and is likely to increase further following the global trend  in expanding deepwater fisheries. The collapse of upper slope chondrichthyan populations after exploitation of these habitats for valuable finfish and/or crustacean resources is well documented (e.g. New South Wales, Australia). The ongoing development of deepwater fishing activities in the area poses a considerable threat to the Madagascar Skate given its restricted range, limited available habitat, and apparent rarity. It is suspected that this species could undergo a population reduction  of 30% or more in the next three generations (21 years) based on actual  and potential levels of exploitation (bycatch); therefore, the Madagascar Skate is assessed as Vulnerable A3d.

Catch data, however, are not available to assess the impact of the predator control program on this species (Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019a, Helgil 2019). </p><p>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979–2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011).

Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p></p><p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019b, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>  </p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation (Heileman and Tang 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).

The species is now uncommon in South Korea, and there are concerns that it may have undergone significant declines given that there has been a 50% decline in myliobatid  landings (C-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). The species abundance is unknown in China, although the abundance of its congener, the Sharpnose Stingray (<em>Telatrygon zugei</em>), at fish markets in China has remained stable over the past 10 years (J.

Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance,  these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have  decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In Japan, the reconstructed catch data from 1950 to 2014 showed a 98% in landings over 65 years (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. <br/></p><p>  </p><p>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).

The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/></p><p>  </p><p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (39 years), they represent declines of 94%, 97%, and 49% in Japan, South Korea, and China, respectively. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the spatial and depth range of the Sharpnose Ray. Fishing pressure has been in decline in Japan over the past three generation lengths (39 years). Seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. Overall, based on a combination of declines in landings and declining fishing effort in Japan, which accounts for most of the species range, it is suspected that the Sharpnose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (39 years).<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">  </p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sharpnose Ray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean where it occurs in southern Japan, South Korea, and China (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). <br/></p>","Based on other <em>Telatrygon</em> spp. in the region, this species is likely used for human consumption and possibly fish meal.",Marine,"<p><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">No specific measures are in place.

The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21701973"">Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people moving into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S.

Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous, and females give birth to 1–5 pups that are 40 cm DW after a gestation of 10–11 months (Villavicencio-Garayazar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994). Generation length (GL) is suspected to be about 28 years, based on data available for the closely-related but smaller Diamond Stingray (<em>Hypanus dipterurus</em>) which has a GL of 18.8 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2007, 2008).","The Longtail Stingray is captured in artisanal gillnets, purse seines, and longlines and in industrial shrimp trawl fisheries which are intense and unmanaged throughout most of its range. Artisanal gillnet fisheries are widespread in the Gulf of California, and they lack effective management and have been responsible for declines in elasmobranchs (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Trawl fisheries operate off Mazatlan and have been noted for their overcapacity, poor governance, and declines in catches (Foster and Vincent 2010). Longline fisheries targeting elasmobranchs began there prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). In Guatemala, this species is sought after in multispecies gillnet fisheries and is commonly caught. In Costa Rica, shrimp trawlers catch this species commonly and it is one of the top three most susceptible species to that fishery (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2018). Although released there, this species made up over 75% of ray catches and over 10% of the overall catch in one study of artisanal fisheries in Costa Rica (López-Garro and Zanella 2015). In Panama, this ray is caught as bycatch and targeted by longlines and artisanal gillnets close to shore (Rodriguez-Arriatti 2011). In addition, it is caught in the Gulf of Panama as bycatch in the artisanal purse seine fishery targeting small pelagic fish (Morales-Saldaña unpubl. data 2019). Artisanal and industrial trawl fisheries are present in Colombia and Ecuador, but management measures are insufficient. Data from landings of small and large-scale fisheries in the Colombian Pacific show a greater capture of juvenile individuals of this species (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2011). Although protections are in place in the Galápagos Islands, illegal fishing continues (Schiller <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is very little refuge from fishing within this species' range, and its large size and presumably late maturation make it highly sensitive to fishing pressure.","There is some evidence of declines of this species in Colombia from a short time-series. In Pacific Colombia,&#160;there was a decrease in the average catch size and in the relative abundance of the Longtail Stingray in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 2001 (150.6 cm TL and 0.27 individuals/hr) and 2007 (129.7 cm TL, and 0.09 individuals/hr; Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). This is a short time-series and caution is required in extrapolating that is a longer-term population reduction. The population is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its range, with little refuge. The life history characteristics of the Longtail Stingray are not conducive to it being able to withstand intense fishing pressure, therefore, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (84 years).",Decreasing,"The Longtail Stingray occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Magdalena Bay, Mexico, to Ecuador including the <span class=""st"">Galápagos Islands (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","This stingray is retained for its meat, which is consumed or sold locally.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this stingray.

A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos&#160;Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).

It inhabits inshore waters, including estuaries, from the shoreline to a depth of 75 m. The species matures at a relatively young age of 3 years, has an annual reproductive cycle, and litters of 2–10 pups. The Lesser Guitarfish is taken as bycatch of trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach seine, and gillnet fisheries, and mostly discarded with post-release mortality varying by gear and likely ranging from 0–33%. It may be retained by some fishers, and targeted by artisanal fishers for the good quality meat and high value fins. Trend analyses of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas estimated a population reduction of 44% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) while trend analysis of angler surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA) estimated a population increase of 14% over the past three generation lengths (15 years). The reduction in research trawls is partly driven by a steep decline in catches during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was substantially higher. Climate change likely contributed to a northeast and inshore range shift away from the research trawl grounds that may account for some of the estimated population reduction, but that also likely represents a range contraction and decline in area of occupancy for the Lesser Guitarfish. The estimated population increase in the De Hoop MPA surveys may be a reflection of the inshore range shift of the species. Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over most of its range  and a substantial reduction in fishing effort in South Africa, combined  with a suspected range shift due to climate change that could account  for some of the estimated reduction but also likely represents a decline  in area of occupancy, it is suspected that the Lesser Guitarfish&#160;has undergone a  population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths  (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Lesser Guitarfish is a shark-like benthic ray that inhabits inshore waters, including estuaries, the surf zone, and enclosed bays, from the shoreline to a depth of 75 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Inshore sandy habitats are used as nursery areas, where the young remain for at least one year (Rossouw 1983). It reaches a maximum size of 140 cm total length (TL) (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), males mature at 58 cm TL and females mature at 61.5–65&#160;cm TL (Rossouw 1983). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 2–10 pups, a gestation period of 10 months,  an annual reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 23 cm TL (Rossouw 1983, Compagno <em>et al. </em>1989). Female age-at-maturity is 3 years and maximum age is 7 years; generation length is therefore 5 years (Rossouw 1983, 1984).","The Lesser Guitarfish is captured in trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach seine, and gillnet fisheries (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015). The species was previously an irregular component of the bycatch of  commercial prawn trawlers in KwaZulu-Natal, occurring  in 2.4% of trawls surveyed, however the trawl fishery has substantially decreased in effort in South Africa over the last decade (Fennessy 1994, S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Gillnet and beach seine fisheries on the Western Cape of South Africa  reported bycatch of this species, but overall these catches were not  significant (Freer and Griffiths 1993, Hutchings and Lamberth 2002).  Some beach seine fishers have reported substantial bycatch landings (up to 10 t  per year, likely also including the Bluntnose Guitarfish<em></em>  due to identification issues), but surveys suggest that this is  uncommon and overall effort from this fishery is small (Hutchings and  Lamberth 2002). Bycatch of the Lesser Guitarfish in the gillnet fishery  appears to be negligible and the animals are reportedly returned alive to the water (Freer and  Griffiths 1993, Hutchings and Lamberth 2002). Parts of Namibia are remote with very little fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). Post-release mortality likely varies with different gear, based on related guitarfish species that have an at-vessel-mortality of 10–33% from trawls, 17% in gillnets, and up to 25% on longlines, depending on the time spent hooked (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). This species may be targeted by artisanal fishers for consumption and trade, as is the case for related guitarfish species  (Moore 2017).<br/><br/>The Lesser Guitarfish has exhibited a northeast range shift within South Africa from 1981–2016 (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2019). This shift is concurrent with a reduction in the probability of encounter in the DAFF research trawl surveys (Supplementary Information Figure 3), and a range contraction with a reduction in area of habitat occupied (Currie<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2019, H. Winker, unpubl. data, 2018). The range shift and reduction in likelihood of encounter are likely related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al.</em> 2010, Blamey <em>et al.</em> 2015), as the interaction with fisheries does not appear substantial enough to be causing the reduction (H. Winker, unpubl. data, 2018).","There are no estimates of population size for the Lesser Guitarfish, although it is an abundant species where it occurs.&#160;Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) annual density estimates from South Africa (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), unpubl. data, 2018); and (2) number of fish per angler per day from surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA), South Africa (Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/> <br/> First, the annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016) in fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 7.5% over the trawled areas, consistent with a median reduction of 43.9% over three past generation lengths (15 years), with the highest probability (40.0%) of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. The estimated reduction is driven partly by a steep decline in catch rates during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was substantially higher; over the last two decades the population reduction has been less dramatic.<strong> </strong>Some reduction is likely a result of a climate driven northeast range shift  of  the species away from the core offshore trawl survey area into  less-surveyed inshore habitats (Supplementary Information Figure 3, Currie <em>et al. </em>2019). The northeast range shift also likely represents a significant range contraction of the Lesser Guitarfish and a reduction in area of occupancy.<br/><br/> Second, the number of fish per angler per day for 1997–2017 (21 years) were available from the De Hoop MPA shore-based research angling surveys conducted by the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA, unpubl. data, 2018). The abundance of the species fluctuated considerably over the 21 years. The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.2%, consistent with a median increase of 14.2% over three past generation lengths (15 years), with the highest probability (98.4%) of an increase over three generation lengths. The De Hoop MPA was established in 1985 and is a no-take reserve, and while this may not be representative of the population trends in fished areas of South Africa, the population increase may be a reflection of the inshore range shift of the species.<br/><br/>Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over most of its range and a substantial reduction in fishing effort in South Africa, combined with a suspected range shift due to climate change that could account for some of the estimated reduction but also likely represents a decline in area of occupancy, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Lesser Guitarfish is a southern African endemic occurring from central Namibia to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

The Pygmy Devilray has an extremely low reproductive output with only one pup born per litter, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devilray (<em>M</em><em>obula&#160;</em>spp.) fisheries. The species is a target of large artisanal fisheries in México and Peru, and is taken as bycatch of small- and large-scale fisheries with much of this catch likely unreported or aggregated and reported as <em>Mobula</em> spp. There are no current or historical estimates of the population  size and trend of the Pygmy Devilray and further information is  required from throughout its range. Based on distribution data, high catchability  due to its schooling behaviour, limited productivity, directed and targeted fisheries, ongoing demand in trade, and a dataset showing declines in devilray sighting records around Cocos Island, it is suspected&#160;that the Pygmy Devilray may have been depleted in areas where significant fisheries or threats for mobulids  exist. There are likely some refuges from fishing, for example in Ecuador's Galápagos Marine Resources Reserve and while it should be noted that illegal fishing is an ongoing issue in the reserve, this refuge suggests that this species may not be at a level of extinction risk characteristic of some other mobuild rays. Overall, it is  suspected that this species has undergone a reduction of ~30–49% over  the last three generations (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056). Therefore, the Pygmy Devilray  is assessed as Vulnerable A2d+3d.","The<em> </em>Pygmy Devilray occurs mainly in tropical, coastal waters from the surface down to 30 m deep (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). This species forms large, highly mobile aggregations, which can be up to tens of thousands individuals at certain times of the year in the Sea of Cortez&#160;(Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2018). It reaches a maximum size of 110 cm disc width (DW) (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at ~87 cm DW, females mature at ~97 cm DW. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of one pup born at ~35 cm DW with unknown reproductive periodicity (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, Villavicencio-Garayzar 1991, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018). Age parameters for this species are unknown and are inferred from the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pardo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, note that the Giant Devilray reaches a considerably larger size than the Pygmy Devilray (520 vs 110 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.","<p>Mobulids, including the Pygmy Devilray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Hall and Roman 2013, Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their tendency to aggregate makes mobulids particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine fisheries and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically kept because of their high trade value. When discarded alive they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2016). The Pygmy Devilray’s epipelagic distribution in regions of high productivity, which overlaps with that of tuna and other highly valued target teleost (bony fish) species, means it is exposed to multiple targeted and bycatch fisheries (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). Furthermore, this species’ preference for coastal waters places it within the range of inshore fisheries.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;</p>    <p>Global landings of mobulid species, including the Pygmy Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, total reported landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009). While this equates to an average of 1,593 t being landed per annum, reported landings are likely to represent only a fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;</p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The source locations for the largest amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</p>  Eastern Pacific Ocean fisheries data indicates a substantial increase in the bycatch of mobulids; from 1993–2013 an average of 2,800 individuals were caught per year, with a range of 1,100–6,500 (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016). Much of the devilray take in this area occurs in the Costa Rica Dome region off Central America (Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) purse seine vessels operating during 2015 in the Pacific reported landings of 71 t of mobulid species, that likely included the Pygmy Devilray (Miller and Klimovich 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Some of the largest documented mobulid fisheries have been in areas that the Pygmy Devilray occurs, specifically, México and Peru (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). A longstanding targeted artisanal mobulid fishery existed off Baja California Sur, México (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988). By the late 1990s, the primary target of this fishery had shifted to the Pygmy Devilray, as the previous target, the Bentfin Devilray (<em>M. thurstoni</em>), had become a minor component of the landings (Bizzarro <em>et al. </em>2009a,b). Recent landings data from this region are unavailable due to the ban on capture of mobulids, however, fisheries for these species continue to operate. In northern Gulf of California artisanal fishery surveys during 1998 and 1999, Pygmy Devilrays were observed to be landed in large numbers at several camps. As catches in the more southerly camps decreased, those in the north increased, suggesting that large portions of the schools may be taken during the unknown movement patterns of this highly mobile species. The species was directly targeted during these times and dominated the elasmobranch landings (Bizzarro 2001). However, although catches consist of hundreds of individuals per day when the species is present, artisanal fishermen indicate that the presence of the Pygmy Devilray is somewhat unpredictable. The Pygmy Devilray is also captured in Ecuador artisanal pelagic longline and gillnet fisheries (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Peru is ranked as having the 15th largest global batoid landings, representing 11% of total landings worldwide between 2005 and 2011. Mobulid landings were 28% of total batoid landings, with the largest proportion of landings coming from the northern coast&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana&#160;<em style="""">et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In&#160;a small-scale fishery&#160;off northern Peru, over 6,000 devilrays are estimated as landed per year&#160;with 97–99% of these landings being the Giant Devilray (Alfaro-Cordova&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2017) which suggests that only small amounts of Pygmy Devilray were caught.&#160;<p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other pollution and contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Shallow water areas have been identified as important nursery habitats of other mobulid species, and as likely also for the Pygmy Devilray (Stevens<em> et al.</em> 2018). The effects of habitat destruction and degradation and pollution in these systems may affect the survival of juvenile Pygmy Devilrays (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>","There are no historical baseline population data and global population numbers are unknown for any devilray species. Globally, however, genus-wide declines are suspected based on declining sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) data from monitored populations, catch landings data, and evidence of depletion (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hall and Roman 2013, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Rohner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Furthermore<a>, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</a>Population trend data for devilrays are most often not species-specific. Hence, many of rates of decline are inferred or suspected, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits.<br/><br/>There are no current or historical estimates of the population size and trend of the Pygmy Devilray and further information is required from throughout its range. It is exposed to many of the same threats as other <em>Mobula</em> species and is constrained by the same low reproductive rate and hence very low population growth rate, suggesting this species could be facing similar pressure to other <em>Mobula</em> species. It is suspected, based on distribution data, high catchability due to its schooling behavior, and occurrence in coastal areas, that the Pygmy Devilray may have been depleted or declined in areas where significant fisheries or threats for mobulids exist.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific Ocean, bycatch estimates from purse seine fisheries increased from 20 t a year before 2005 to a maximum of 150 t a year by 2006, and then reduced to 10 t by 2009 (Hall and Roman 2013). Grouped species bycatch data such as these are likely indicative of overall devilray population declines following over-exploitation in the region. A 20-year survey (1993–2013) reported a 78% decline in observational sighting records of devilrays around Cocos Island, Costa Rica by recreational SCUBA divers (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). While species-level identifications were not available in this study, this area is within the distribution of the Pygmy Devilray. The degree to which this index reflects wider population trends is unknown. Cocos Island is a marine protected area and lies within the area of activity of the Eastern Tropical Pacific purse seine tuna fisheries which takes large numbers of devilrays as incidental catch (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<br/><br/>These data suggest declines in mobulid rays in the Eastern Pacific, although there are likely some refuges from fishing, for example in Ecuador's Galápagos Marine Resources Reserve. While it should be noted that illegal fishing is an ongoing issue in the reserve (Carr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Schiller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), this refuge suggests that this species may not be at a level of extinction risk characteristic of some other mobuild rays. Although specific data are lacking, with current and future potential levels of exploitation, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056).&#160;Therefore, the Pygmy Devilray is assessed as Vulnerable A2d+3d.",Decreasing,"The Pygmy Devilray is restricted to tropical coastal waters of the Eastern Central Pacific and Southeast Pacific where it is known from the Gulf of California, México to Peru, including the <span>Galápagos, Cocos, and Malpelo Islands (Lawson<em> et al. </em>2017, Stevens <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><span></span>","<p>The Pygmy Devilray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates.

The cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs<em> et al.</em> 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).

This species occurs at depths from the surface down to 2,647 m, but mainly at 300–500 m in Baffin Bay. This species potentially has the world's longest generation span of 274 years, however, we conservatively use a generation length of 150 years, and consider a generation length of 50–75 years.&#160;The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (<em>r</em><sub>max</sub>)&#160;of Greenland Shark is 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup>&#160;which is nearly half the lowest&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub></em>&#160;previously calculated for any shark or ray.&#160;There have been target fisheries for this species for its for liver oil since the 13th century with an increase in fisheries since the 17th Century (one generation length). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, ending in the 1940–1960s with the development of synthetic oils. Since then, it has been taken as discarded bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries with approximately 3,500 individuals caught each year in the Northwest Atlantic, Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea. A population reconstruction, based on catch records, reveals that the Greenland Shark has been declining since the early 1600s with steepest declines beginning in the early 1800s through to the 1940s whereupon target fisheries were ended. Since then there is ongoing mortality from bycatch, but the overall fishing mortality is significantly reduced but is close to a level that may cause a decline, depending on bycatch survival rates and population generation length and resilience. The Greenland Shark was estimated to have declined by 57% in the 420 years since the 1600s, but is likely to have increased by 3% in the past century (1920–2020). The global estimated population reduction is 59% over the equivalent of three generation lengths (450 years),&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">but this value could range from&#160;11.7–72.9 depending on whether the generation length is shorter (50<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">75 years) or longer (274 years). The historic and current catch levels are uncertain, in particular the population reconstruction is likely to be highly sensitive to the catch of adults versus juveniles and post-release survival rate. Most catches seem to comprise juveniles, which might be more sustainable, but the abundance of adults seems very low and uncertain. Further, climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets and there is a projected loss of Arctic sea ice by 50% over the next 100 years. Taken together, the long history of fishing, ongoing exploitation (albeit at significantly lower levels than historically), and an extremely conservative life history, and climate change impacts of declining Arctic sea ice, it is suspected that the Greenland Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (450 years).&#160;Therefore, the Greenland Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.</span></p>","The Greenland Shark is demersal and mesopelagic on continental and insular shelves and upper slopes from the surface down to at least 2,647 m, but mainly at 300–500 m in Baffin Bay (Ebert <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Campana <em>et al. </em>2015, N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It tends to move inshore coastal areas in summer and offshore in winter (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It reaches a maximum size of 640 cm total length (TL), possibly to 730 cm TL; males mature at 260 cm TL and females mature at 400 cm TL (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with at least 2 and a maximum of 10 pups per litter, the later based on a single individual (Koefoed 1957, Castro 2011) and size–at–birth of 40–100 cm TL (Yano&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Reproductive periodicity is assumed to be biennial based on other sleeper sharks (Somniosidae:&#160;Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;<em>Centroselachus crepidater</em><em>&#160;</em>and<em> </em>Plunket’s Shark <a style=""font-style: italic;"">Scymnodo</a><em>n plunketi</em>)&#160;(Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009).&#160;Female age-at-maturity is&#160;estimated as&#160;156 years and maximum age is&#160;estimated as&#160;392 years (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016); hence generation length could be as much as 274 years. However, the radiocarbon dating of eye lens structures relies on understanding <sup>14</sup>C dynamics prior to nuclear weapons testing and the rate of mixing of surface waters into the deep ocean and these uncertainties can result in a wide range of birth dates (Natanson <em>et al. </em>2018, M.A. MacNeil pers. comm. 27/07/2020). These sharks live in deep-water which is depleted in radiocarbon and hence it is difficult to determine what pre-and post-nuclear weapon-testing radiocarbon levels should be to serve as a baseline for aging (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020).&#160;It is likely that the generation length is more similar to other deep-water sharks at 50–75 years (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020). Here, we assume an intermediate generation length of 150 years.","<p>Historically, this species has been targeted for its liver oil since the 13th century in Norway, and from the 14th century in Iceland, with target catches peaking in the early 1900s and ending in the 1940s–1960s. There has been increase in fisheries for liver oil since the 17th century and target catches of Greenland Shark have been significant over the past three centuries (at least two generation lengths). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, peaking and largely ending in the 1940s with the development of synthetic oils. The fishery in Greenland commenced in the early 19th century and by 1857 the estimated catch was 2,000–3,000 individuals per year. Thereafter, the fishery expanded until the beginning of the 1890s and catches increased to 11,500–15,000 growing to 32,000 individuals per year by 1910 (Jensen 1914). Peak catch was of an estimated 58,000 individuals annually based on reported production of 2.8 million kg of liver oil in Norway in 1948 (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Commercial fishing of Greenland Shark for liver oil ceased in the 1960s along with the cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland&#160;(Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). During the 1970s, the species was perceived as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery in order to reduce the stock of the species (Castro<em>&#160;et al. </em>1999). Target artisanal fisheries still occur in Greenland and Iceland, with the catch averaging 25 t annually in Iceland since 2005 (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;</p><p>More recently, since the 1960s, this species was threatened by bycatch in industrial fisheries. Greenland Shark has been taken as bycatch of trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries in the Arctic Ocean and off Canada and the USA since the 1960s (Benjamins <em>et al. </em>2010) and Barents Sea (Rusyaev&#160;and Orlov 2013). Approximately 3,500 individuals are taken as bycatch each year in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea (see Supplementary Information 1). While little is known of discard mortality is it likely to be much lower from longlines through ice than from deep-water trawls (D.W. Kulka pers. obs. 2020). However, higher mortaltiy may occur when longline gear wraps the tail too tightly cutting off circulation causing the tail to die and when longline hooks pull through, breaking the jaw, when the shark surfaces (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020).&#160;Based on recent observations by fishery observers, more than 1,000 individuals are caught annually from Arctic waters (NAFO Subarea O) south to USA waters (NAFO Subarea 6) (Bryk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hendrickson 2018, Hendrickson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Simpson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Wheeland and Devine 2018). Bycatch of Greenland Shark was likely higher historically in waters south of the Arctic given much higher levels of effort. Annual catch of Greenland Shark from the Barents Sea was estimated to be 1,200 individuals per year, based on catch weight of 140–150 t (Rusyaev and Orlov 2013). In the Canadian Arctic, Greenland Shark was mainly a discarded bycatch in demersal shrimp trawls before the introduction of the Nordmore grate. It is now only a bycatch in the Greenland halibut demersal trawl fisheries&#160;with some catch in gillnets, longlines, and setlines in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, on the Labrador shelf since the 1990s (based on observer data, M. Treble, unpub. data 2019, D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). Catches rose to peak at 800 t in 1990, before declining to 100–200 t between 2002–2008 with a more recent decline to 100 t due to shifting fishing patterns towards the target species (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Greenland sharks captured by demersal longlines can become entangled with the mainline tightly wrapped around the caudal peduncle complicating release efforts. There are cases of persecution in Iceland and Canada where the tails have been cut off before the animal is returned to the water (Davis <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Norwegian vessels take Greenland Shark as bycatch in the halibut longline fishery of the Northeast Atlantic and livers occasionally harvested from discarded carcasses (C.F. Cotton pers. obs. 2004).&#160;The distribution and carrying capacity of Greenland Shark is likely to be affected by anthropogenic climate change, which is affecting the quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). With few exceptions, Greenland shark is primarily found in the seas around the Arctic polar icecap and in continental and insular fjord ecosystems (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). While poorly understood, the rate of projected loss of sea ice will have and will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Climate change has warmed mean summer sea surface temperatures by approximately 0.7<sup>o</sup>C per decade from 1982—2017, very likely resulting in a recent reduction in extent of sea ice extent of 3.5–4.1% per decade from 1979 to 2012 (Stocker <em>et al. </em>2013). Overall, there has been a ~50% reduction in summer sea ice extent since 1850 (Walsh <em>et al. </em>2017). Sea ice is projected to decline by at least a further 50% over the next 100 years (IPCC 2019). Consequently, existing demersal longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries for Northern Shrimp (<em>Pandalus borealis</em>) and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius h</em><em>ippoglosoides</em>) are expanding northwards into previously unfished habitats and fishing seasons are lengthening allowing sustained effort for longer periods (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Further, there is greater potential for new fisheries to develop as more productive and abundant southerly species invade the warming Arctic waters (Tai <em>et al.</em> 2019). These newly developing fisheries are reportedly catching greater numbers of sharks and skates, particularly Greenland Shark (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013). The common bycatch of Greenland Shark in some western Greenland fisheries has led to the proposal to once again use them as a biofuel (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of Greenland Shark. Population trend data are available from three sources (1) local abundance estimates, (2) an estimate of maximum population growth rate, which combined with catch data was used to (3) reconstruct population trajectory from 1600 to 2020.&#160;</p><p>First, in unfished areas local densities can be high in summer ranging from 0.4–15.5 individuals km<sup>-2</sup> in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. These density estimates are comparable to estimates of Grey Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</em>) in the relatively pristine Palmyra atoll. These comprise mainly juvenile size classes with an average length of 2.48 m and a notable absence of adults (Devine <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, in areas where there have been large historic fisheries Greenland Shark are now less common. However, this could be an artefact of using fishing gear that is not strong enough to land the larger individuals (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). Annual demersal trawl surveys throughout west, south, and east Greenland suggest Greenland Shark are patchily distributed and uncommon. For example, only 106 individuals were captured from 9,744 hauls between 1988–2011 by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources (GNIR) survey (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2014) and catch rates in Canadian Research surveys are low (Simpson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, large catches can be made in certain places and at times of year, e.g. catches of 5–15 sharks on 50 hooks in a 12-hour period (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). Trawl swept area estimates are highly uncertain yet suggest high biomass and abundance of 70,000 t and 100,000 individuals in West Greenland Shelf, from south Greenland to Upernavik (Hedeholm <em>et al. </em>2018). However, this estimate depends highly on catchability and little is known of catchability in trawls, but it is likely lower than the catchability of this species in longlines (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Second, while patchily abundant throughout Arctic and boreal regions of the Atlantic,&#160;this species is thought to have the world's longest generation length (GL) of 274 years, however, this age has not been validated and is more likely that the generation length is much lower (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020) and here we assume a more conservative value of 150 years. The median maximum intrinsic rate of population increase, <em>r<sub>max</sub></em>, of Greenland Shark is 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup> (95th percentile = 0.025–0.044; Supplementary Information). This is nearly half the lowest <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> previously calculated for any shark or ray. For comparison, the lowest shark <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> is 0.054 for the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) and the lowest ray <em>r<sub>max </sub></em>is 0.067 for the Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). The median maximum intrinsic rate of population increase, <em>r<sub>max</sub></em>, is the limit of fishing mortality that can be withstood without the population declining to extinction, <em>F<sub>extinct</sub></em><sub> </sub>hence 100*(exp(<em>r<sub>max</sub></em>)-1) yields the percentage mortality each year that would drive this species to extinction which is 3.3% (95th percentile = 2.5–4.5%). Assuming the breeding population size (<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>) was 130,945 (calculated estimated assuming a GL of 150) (Walter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017) then killing only around 4,300 adults&#160;(95th percentile = 3,321–5,832) would be sufficient to cause a decline. The current estimated bycatch of around 3,500 individuals may be sufficient to cause a decline (see Supplementary Information). We caution that this bycatch level assumes 100% post-release mortality and this species may have moderate discard survival. Hence, this species is least likely to be able to sustain even light levels of fishing mortality.&#160;</p><p>Third, the population trajectory was reconstructed over the 420 years 1600–2020 (approximately 2.5 generation lengths, assuming a 150 GL) based on a Schaeffer-Logistic population model and reconstructed catches, assuming a carrying capacity of 3.2 million individuals and a population growth rate <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup>&#160;(95th percentile = 0.025–0.044; Supplementary Information). These carrying capacity estimates are arbitrary but smaller numbers resulted in the catch reconstruction tending toward extinction. It is likely that the Greenland Shark has been declining since the early 1600s with steepest declines beginning in the early 1800s through to the 1940s whereupon most target fisheries were ended. Since then the population is most likely to have increased despite continued low levels of bycatch mortality that most recently are in the region of 3,500 individuals captured annually (Supplementary Information). These broad patterns are highly sensitive to generation length,&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>,&#160;</em>and carrying capacity assumptions. Slightly lower generation length,&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>, </em>and&#160;carrying capacity assumptions led to extinction and slightly higher values led to complete recovery. Any values capturing the likely decline due to target fishing also suggest there has been recovery since the cessation of target fisheries. Specifically, the population reconstruction reveals that the Greenland Shark has declined by 57% in the 420 years since the 1600 (range 9–100%&#160;depending on&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>&#160;</em>and&#160;carrying capacity assumptions<span lang=""EN-US"">). I<span lang=""EN-US"">n the past century 1920<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">2020 Greenland Shark&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">has increased slightly 3% (range: 57% increase to 100% decline)<span lang=""EN-US"">. The global estimated population reduction is 59.3% (range 9.8<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">100%) over the equivalent of three generation lengths (450 years) (Supplementary Information, Figure 6b middle panel). Assuming a much more modest generation length of 50<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">75 years, then the estimated population reduction is 11.7% (range 1%<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">99.9%) over three generation lengths (Supplementary Information,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Figure 6a middle panel). Assuming a longer generation length of 274 years, then the estimated population reduction is 72.9% (range 22.9%<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">100%) over three generation lengths (Supplementary Information,&#160;Figure 6c middle panel).&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Fourth, the population reduction analysis does not consider the likely reduction in carrying capacity of Greenland Shark from anthropogenic climate change, which is affecting the quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). With few exceptions, Greenland shark is primarily found in the seas around the Arctic polar icecap and in continental and insular fjord ecosystems (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). While poorly understood, the rate of projected loss of sea ice will have and will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Overall, the Greenland Shark has undergone an inferred population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations lengths (450 years), but this value could range from&#160;11.7–72.9% depending on whether the generation length is shorter (50<span lang=""EN-US"">–</span><span lang=""EN-US"">75 years) or longer (274 years).</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Greenland Shark is found in the&#160;North Atlantic from the USA and Canada to Greenland in the west and from Portugal to the Barents Sea and Eastern Siberian Sea (Moreno and Pol 1992, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, A.M. Orlov pers. comm. 25/08/2020). Genetic analyses caution that the geographic range of this species may be much narrower, ranging from Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Norway, with occasional records from Cuba, France and Spain (Canary Is.) (Yano <em>et al.</em> 2007, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017, Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2018). Records from the western Atlantic, including records from the northern Gulf of Mexico and Canadian side off the Davis Strait exhibit evidence of introgressive hybridisation with Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>) which has been recorded as far north as the Azores Islands (Portugal) (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","<p>This species was taken in target fisheries for liver oil (for lamps, engine oil and vitamin A), skin (for leather), and meat for dogfood since the 13th century in Canada, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland (Jensen 1914, MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is now taken as discarded bycatch in Canadian Arctic demersal trawls, longlines, and gillnets (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). There is some subsistence utilization in Canada, Greenland, and Iceland (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, ICES-WGEF 2018).

In 1999 the USA effected a Fishery Management Plan (FMP), that includes catch limits and quotas for sharks, swordfish and tunas. Greenland Shark is not included in the USA FMP&#160;because they are not targeted and rarely encountered by U.S. fishing vessels.&#160;</p><p></p><p>In Canada, there is also a Shark Management Plan but Greenland Shark is not included because the species is not targeted in Canadian waters.

The following measures are recommended: prohibition on the retention and landing of Greenland Sharks, live release of captured animals, promotion of safe handling practices, the introduction of gear restrictions and area closures aimed at keeping fishing mortality as close to zero as possible. Improved observer coverage and mandatory reporting of catch data for all sharks and rays, including species identity, numbers, size, sex, and discard status are recommended. Catch data quality could be improved with the development and use of a Greenland shark photographic identification sheet for fishery observers (Hendrickson <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>The development and implementation of bycatch policy and mitigation measures is recommended (Hendrickson <em>et al.</em> 2018). The Nordmore grate, a bycatch excluder meant to allow escapement of bycatch was made mandatory for the Canadian shrimp fisheries of the Labrador Shelf and Davis Strait in the 1990s. This modification of the gear allowed the sharks to escape immediately from the net with minimal harm thus greatly reduced the shark bycatch, from hundreds of tonnes per year (thousands of fish) to less than 1 tonne per year. Before its implementation, the shrimp fishery was responsible for the largest proportion of the incidental catch of Greenland sharks (D.W. Kulka, unpub. data 2019).</p><p>Further, the use of weak breaking-strength longline gangions resulted in release of Greenland Sharks bycatch without losing the target species Greenland Halibut because of the large size disparity between the species (Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2018, S.W.

In Colombia,  industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating at  ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and  expanded until the 1980s when overfishing became apparent (Wielgus <em>et al.</em> 2010). This species is among the most commonly caught batoids in this fishery (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2007), and in the mid-2000s the fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world (Duarte <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing&#160;(Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was  introduced there in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the  1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing  intensity increased for several decades and shrimp landings peaked at ~9,000 t in the  1990s (Manickchand-Heileman<em> et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address  over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a  reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went  into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Reported and reconstructed landings  in Venezuela increased substantially from the 1960s until the early  2000s, followed by severe declines in the years since (Mendoza 2015).

Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 1–5 pups per litter (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2007a). Generation length is suspected to be ~4.5 years, based on data available for the related Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>), which has a larger maximum size of 75 cm TL, an age-at-maturity of 6 years, a maximum age of 15 years, and thus a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000).","The Venezuelan Dwarf Numbfish is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal trawl fisheries, which are intense and largely unmanaged across its limited range. In Colombia, industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al.</em> 2010). This species is among the most commonly caught batoids in this fishery (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2007b), and in the mid-2000s the fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world (Duarte <em>et al. </em>2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing&#160;(Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced there in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and shrimp landings peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman<em> et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Reported and reconstructed overall fisheries landings in Venezuela increased substantially from the 1960s until the early 2000s, followed by severe declines in subsequent years (Mendoza 2015). Since the 2009 industrial trawl ban, artisanal trawl fleets have expanded substantially, with little management and no monitoring in place. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were over 130 trawl vessels of various sizes operating off the west and south coasts of Trinidad by 2011 (Mohammed <em>et al. </em>2011). Overall, this species is subjected to intense trawling pressure across its range. There is likely to be some refuge at depth in Colombia, where trawling is restricted to shallow inshore waters.","Due to the level of fishing pressure that this species is exposed to across its range, offset by its small size and likely relatively productive life history, it is suspected that the Venezuelan Dwarf Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (13.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Venezuelan Dwarf Numbfish occurs in the Western Central Atlantic from eastern Colombia to Trinidad and Tobago (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Agreda-Arango 2019). <span class=""searchmatch"">This species is likely to be confused with and possibly even hybridizes with its congeners the Colombian Dwarf Numbfish (<em>Diplobatis colombiensis</em>) and the Painted Dwarf Numbfish (<em>Diplobatis picta</em>), and therefore their ranges should be confirmed.<span class=""searchmatch""></span>",This numbfish is not known to be utilized or traded.

It is demersal on the continental shelves at depths of 41–70 m. The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with a likely low post release survival rate. It is considered common in Viet Nam and rare in Taiwan. Inferred and suspected declines over the past three generation lengths (15 years) range from 23–97%, although across most of its range the declines are 23–46% and across most of that area, fishing pressure is high. Based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the Shortlip Numbfish&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 41–70 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 32 cm total length (TL), though is usually smaller at 25 cm TL; males mature at ~23 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (de Carvalho 1999, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous, based on other <em>Narcine </em>species, with size-at-birth of ~8 cm TL (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Shortlip Numbfish (75 vs 32 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Shortlip Numbfish. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is likely mostly discarded due to its small size that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), but is possibly retained for local consumption and 'trash fish' in Malaysia and Cambodia (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). Post release survival is likely low, as <em>Narcine </em>species are soft bodied and easily damaged (de Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Across China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh e<em>t al.</em> 2014a, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, FAO 2020). In Malaysia, this species is taken regularly as bycatch of demersal trawls (Last<em> et al.</em> 2010). Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s led to fully exploited  inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort  in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal  and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of  vessels across all sectors has tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in  1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2014, with fishing effort in Sabah also rising,  particularly in artisanal fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh<em> et al.</em> 2014b). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been  increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial  fisheries (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all  sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak  of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels  in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard<em> et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). </p>  <p></p>","<p>There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. It is common in Viet Nam and rare in Taiwan and Myanmar (Lin 2010, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, H. Ho, A. Maung and V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China, Viet Nam, Borneo, Cambodia, and Myanmar Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). In Sarawak, reconstructed landings showed a 50% decline from a peak of 14,690 t in 1997 to 7,300 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to 1980, dropped then  peaked again in 1995–1997 before sharply declining. In Sabah,  reconstructed landings showed a 37% decline from a peak of ~27,000 t in  1998 to 17,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Fishing pressure  has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus the declines infer  reductions in these populations in Sarawak and Sabah.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to  the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no  substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to  around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in  fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been  no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings  have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years  have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Thailand, landings data are available on all combined ray species  from the EEZ for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings  data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose  steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a  steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is  difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>When these inferred declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Shortlip Numbfish (15 years), they represent declines of 23%, 85%, 46%, 35%, and 97% in China, Viet Nam, Sarawak, Sabah, and Cambodia, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The declines range from 23–97%, although across most of the species’  range the declines are 23–46%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Shortlip Numbfish. Overall, based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is found from the South China Sea to the Bay of Bengal in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. It occurs from China to Bangladesh, including Taiwan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Borneo (Malaysia), Myanmar, and Bangladesh (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","In Borneo, this species is consumed but is considered low grade and it is also used for fish meal (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). Elsewhere, based on cogeneric and sympatric <em>Narcin</em>e species, the Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is likely not used for human consumption as there is very little meat on the animal, except for Cambodia where small individuals may be consumed (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). In Bangladesh, <em>Narcine</em> species are generally discarded at sea as fishers fear being electrocuted by them (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In China and Taiwan, it is retained but discarded at the markets as it is unsuitable for fish meal in those countries; it may sometimes be consumed by fishers at sea in Taiwan (H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). In Malaysia, and for small individuals in Cambodia, it is likely used for 'trash fish' (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020), that is, fish meal and other products.",Marine,"<p>No specific conservation measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three  nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger  than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, large mesh gillnets (&gt;24.5 cm) were banned in 1990 (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05 2020). In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher,&#160;pers. comm. 02/04/2020). Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Shortlip Numbfish, and catch rates should be monitored.&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is captured in industrial longline and trawl fisheries, which operate throughout its range. Although discarded dead in some parts of its range, it is utilized for human consumption in others. In the Southeast Pacific, skates targeted in fisheries (<em>Dipturus </em>spp.) have undergone severe population reductions where this species is captured as unmanaged bycatch. In the Southwest Atlantic, there are some general management measures in place for skates but they are not species-specific. This skate is now absent from approximately one-third of its distribution in Argentina due to heavy fishing pressure on skates. Overall, due to the level of exposure to inadequately managed fisheries, noted population reductions in other skates, its lack of refuge at depth, a suspected decline in area of occupancy, and a  combination of declines in some areas and stability in others, it is  suspected that the Whitedotted Skate has undergone a population  reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (40.5 years).

As in other skates, reproduction is oviparous (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016); ovarian fecundity ranges from 4 to 32 with a mean of 14. An annual reproductive cycle is suspected and size at hatch is 10.5 cm disc width (Henderson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Female age-at-maturity is 10 years and longevity is 17 years (Henderson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004), therefore generation length is estimated to be about 13.5 years.","<p>This skate is captured as bycatch of longline and trawl fisheries that operate throughout its geographic and depth range.

There have been heavy target and bycatch fisheries for skates in Chilean and Argentinian waters, and steep declines are suspected. However, this species seems to be abundant and stable elsewhere in the Southwest Atlantic, including the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). <br/><br/> In the Southeast Pacific, the targeted Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) was estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over three generation lengths (52.5 years for that species) due to overfishing<span style=""""></span>, and this species is captured as bycatch with Yellownose Skate in that fishery. <br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, the Whitedotted Skate is one of the most commonly captured skates caught in the target skate fishery north of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas); standardized catch-per-unit-effort there increased from 1993 to a peak in 2006–2007 and declined thereafter until 2017 (Winter 2018). In Argentina, this species was most abundant on the outer continental shelf and slope in two areas, in the northern and central area, from Rio del Plata to Comodora Rivadavia (between 36.3 and 45 degrees S) and west of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Ruocco <em>et al. </em>2006).

Information on discard mortality is limited, but it may be low (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker et al. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across the range of this species. Reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2017). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries and destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) operating in this region by 2010 (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).","Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Mediterranean Sea (Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2020). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (48 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS; 1994–2015) from the Northern Alboran Sea and off Northern Spain revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.8%, consistent with an increasing population over the past three generation lengths (48 years). Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, a population reduction of 24% was reported in the Adriatic Sea between 1948–2005 (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Northeast Atlantic, landings of the Marbled Torpedo Ray in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Waters show a gradual declining trend from 2005 to 2018 (ICES-WGEF 2019). Abundance estimates of the species declined significantly in research trawl surveys from 1980 to 2018 covering the Northeast Atlantic (coast of Portugal to the North Sea and from the Baltic Sea to the west of Scotland) (Rindorf <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Data are sparse throughout the remainder of its distribution. The species was frequently reported along the West Africa coast, from Mauritania to Guinea (Diop and Dossa 2011). Across West Africa, total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950–2010, while the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of artisanal and industrial vessels declined by 34% over this period (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel et al. 2007). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The average elasmobranch catch has increased by nearly 6-fold from 1,399 t in 1950 to 8,329 t in 2015, while the average fishing effort has increased by a factor of nearly 43 during this time period (2,994 kW to 127,798 kW) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Regional elasmobranch CPUE has decreased by 85% (0.47 t/kW to 0.07 t/kw) from 1950 to 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). While these levels of declines are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region, and would equate to &gt;90% decline across three generation lengths (48 years) of the Marbled Torpedo Ray. <br/><br/>The Marbled Torpedo Ray is estimated to be stable in the Mediterranean Sea and is suspected to be declining in the Northeast and Central Atlantic where historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high. Overall, it is suspected that the Marbled Torpedo Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation.

Gillnet fisheries in the Gulf of California have caused declines in other species such as turtles, marine mammals, and pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Shrimp trawl fisheries operate in the southern Gulf of California and off Mazatlan shrimp trawling is heavy and this fishery is reported to suffer from overcapacity, poor governance, and declines in catches (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Costa Rica, this species is susceptible to being caught in shrimp trawl fisheries (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2018), however these fisheries are declining and the last permits expire in 2019 (M.

It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <br/></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In Japan, this species is taken as part of a predator control program implemented in Ariake Bay in 2001 to protect shellfish. However, catch data are not available to assess the impact of the predator control program on this species (Furumitsu <em>et al. </em>2019, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019).

Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).

This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species. Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.

Significant localised depletion of the Japanese Eagle Ray in Ariake Bay is evident with a population reduction of 94% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) due to the predator control program. Historical fishing pressure was high across the spatial and depth range of the Japanese Eagle Ray, and it remains high in China, and to a lesser extent South Korea, but has declined in Japan over the past 30 years.

This is similar to the generation length of 20 years that has been used for other <em>Oxynotus </em>spp. (Soldo and Guallart <a style="""">2015</a>).","The Sailfin Roughshark is very infrequently reported as bycatch across its range in demersal trawl fisheries (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, O'Hea <em>et al</em>. 2020, Santos <em>et al. </em>2020). The species may inhabit depths beyond the reach of some regional fishing activities; a large number of Sailfin Roughshark were reported from trawl surveys operating at depths &gt;800 m off northwest Africa (Pajuelo <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;<br/><br/><a>There</a>&#160;are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino<em>&#160;et al. </em>2017) and at 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta <em>et al. </em>2019). In Mauritania, there are also demersal longline fisheries for Ray's Bream (<em>Brama brama</em>) operating to depths &gt;1,500 m and demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) operating mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at 100–400 m (Cervantes&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;<br/><br/>There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/> <br/> West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels <em>et al.</em> 2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable&#160;in the short term (FAO 2020).","There are no species-specific population trends for the Sailfin Roughshark. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant datasets for fish and elasmobranch landings and catch rates that are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generation lengths (60 years). Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández et al. 2005). Across West Africa, total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950–2010, while the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of artisanal and industrial vessels declined by 34% over this period (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the northwest Africa region (Morocco to Guinea-Bissau), total elasmobranch catch in the industrial sector increased by a factor of ten between 1950–2015, from 6,031 t to 60,822 t (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/><em>Oxynotus </em>species are highly susceptible to population decline from fishing, and populations in the Mediterranean and Northeast Atlantic have declined by an estimated 80% over three generation lengths (60 years), or disappeared altogether, in areas with high fishing effort (Soldo and Guallart 2015, Soldo and Guallart 2016). The Sailfin Roughshark is suspected to be declining across its distribution where historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019) and previous declines in deep-water sharks have been documented (for example, see Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2018). It may have refuge at depth. Overall, it is suspected that the Sailfin Roughshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) and is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",Decreasing,"The Sailfin Roughshark is endemic to the Northeast and Eastern Central Atlantic, from Scotland to Senegal, and possibly southwards to the Gulf of Guinea (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species has also been reported from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge&#160;(Hareide and Garnes 2001).",The species may be used for fishmeal (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).,Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Sailfin Roughshark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic. In 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Sailfin Roughshark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2019). Since 2017, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m depth in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and monkfish (<em>Lophius </em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2019).<br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 450–830 m. The species is only currently known from ~20 specimens. It is taken as bycatch and possibly targeted in demersal line fisheries and likely retained for its meat and liver oil.<strong><br/><br/></strong>There are no species-specific population trends although landings data of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and catches of all sharks combined from the Taiwan EEZ infer declines of 99% and 70%, respectively over the past three generation lengths (102 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>Shark populations are anecdotally reported to have declined in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands since the target shark fishery commenced in the 1980s. A recent strategy to further develop deep-water fishing in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is of concern for this species. The Japanese Velvet Dogfish has a likely low biological productivity, is subject to intense fishing pressure in some parts of its  distribution, and has little refuge from fishing pressure in its known  range. It is a rare species, but it is not known if this is due to a  naturally low population size or to overfishing.<br/><br/>A  precautionary approach leads to a suspected population reduction of 30–49%  over the past three generation lengths (102 years) due to levels of exploitation, and the Japanese Velvet Dogfish is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Japanese Velvet Dogfish is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 450–830 m (White <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weigmann 2016). The depth range is based on type specimens from Japan with no depth information available for the Taiwan specimens (White <em>et al.</em> 2015). It reaches a maximum size of at least 151 cm total length (TL), males mature at 89 cm TL and females mature at 126 cm TL (Yano and Tanaka 1984, White <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b, White <em>et al. </em>2015). Age parameters are inferred from the closely related Plunket's Shark (<em>Scymnodon plunketi</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 29 years and estimated maximum age of 39 years, thus generation length is estimated at 34 years (Daley <em>et al.</em> 2002, Irvine 2004).","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. The known specimens were caught in Japan by deepset line surveys and fisheries (Yana and Tanaka 1984, Compagno <em>et al</em>.  2005). A localised fishery targeting deep-water sharks previously operated in  Suruga Bay, Honshu, using demersal longlines (McCormack and Tanaka 2009). It is unknown whether this species comprised part  of the catch in that fishery<em> </em>(McCormack and Tanaka 2009). A deep-water dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) currently operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28/08/2019) and may capture this species. If susceptible to capture in gillnets, it may be taken in Suruga Bay by demersal gillnets that target fish and crustaceans at depths of 100–500 m (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28/08/2019).</p><p> Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). </p><p>In Taiwan, this species was captured and retained by commercial longlines operating off Cheong-gong, Taitung, southeast Taiwan. Deep-water longlines operate on the east coast of Taiwan, targeting mostly tuna with all incidental shark catch retained and marketed. The longline fishery likely began during the 1980s, and mostly operated at depths of 100–300 m, though catches of this species and other deep-water species indicate that the fishery has moved into deeper waters (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). <br/></p><p></p><p></p>  <p></p><p>There is no information on the capture of this species in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2018). A target fishery for elasmobranchs has operated in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands since the 1980s and there is a deep-water target shark fishery for shark liver oil (Bineesh <em>et al.</em> 2020, Tyabji <em>et al. </em>2020).

This</a><a name=""_Hlk23247743""> is of concern as it further increases the likelihood of capture of the Japanese Velvet Dogfish.</a></p><p></p>","There are no species-specific trend data for this species. It is currently only known from ~20 specimens: the holotype, 6 paratypes, and a recently collected specimen from Suruga Bay and adjacent waters in Japan; 11 specimens from southeast Taiwan; and a single record from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India (White <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2018). The species is considered very rare in Japan (McCormack and Tanaka 2009). <br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Japan, fishing effort has declined by about one third since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). The reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort, which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. <br/><br/>  In Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks and skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, anecdotal information from fishers indicates that shark and ray populations have declined since targeted fishing commenced in the 1980s (Tyabji <em>et al. </em>2020). Reconstructed sharks, rays, and skates landings indicate declining catches from 1980 to 2014; the catches peaked at nearly 8,000 t in 1998 then fluctuated and declined to around 4,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). No concurrent information on effort in the area is available, and thus a shark population trend cannot be inferred.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Japanese Velvet Dogfish (102 years) they represent declines of 99% and 70% in Japan and Taiwan, respectively. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. This species is subject to intense fishing pressure in some parts of its distribution and has little refuge from fishing pressure in its known range. It is highly likely to have low biological productivity, based on other sleeper sharks, which reduces its ability to recover from fishing pressure. It is a rare species, but it is not known if this is due to a naturally low population size or to overfishing. Other deep-water shark populations have declined dramatically in response to intense fishing pressure (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2000, Graham <em>et al.</em> 2001, Tyabji <em>et al. </em>2020). Based on the levels of fishing pressure, declines in all shark species in its range, and the suspected declines in other deep-water sharks exposed to such fishing pressure, a precautionary approach leads to a suspected population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (102 years).",Decreasing,"The Japanese Velvet Dogfish has a patchy distribution in the Northwest Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans where it is known from Suruga Bay and adjacent waters in Japan, Cheng-gong, Taitung, in southeast Taiwan, and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, White <em>et al. </em>2015, Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2018).","<p>Based on other sleeper sharks (Somniosidae), this species is likely used for its meat at local markets and processed for liver oil (Akhilesh<em> et al.</em> 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b).</p>",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. <a name=""_Hlk23247743"">In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). </a><a name=""_Hlk23247743""></a><a name=""_Hlk23247743"">In Taiwan, since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nautical miles (nm) in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019).

It is a demersal inshore species that occurs at depths of 90<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>100 m. The species is a bycatch of&#160;demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan EEZ indicate declines of 30% and 88%, respectively over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the spatial and depth range of the Ocellate Topeshark in Taiwan, but may be less intense in its range across the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The  inshore trawl bans in Taiwan may afford the species some refuge from  fishing pressure. Fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort in Japan is  decreasing and continuing to decline. Overall, it is inferred that the Ocellate Topeshark&#160; has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last  three generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.<strong><br/> </strong>","The Ocellate Topeshark is demersal and occurs inshore on the continental shelf at depths of  90–100 m (Takahashi and Nakaya 2004, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 95.5 cm total length (TL); males mature at 76 cm TL and females mature at 81 cm TL (Takahashi and Nakaya 2004, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with litters of 5–8 and size-at-birth of 24 cm TL (Takahashi and Nakaya 2004, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely-related species, the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 4–6 years and a maximum age of &gt;15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10 years (Yamada 1986, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28 August 2019).","The Ocellate Topeshark is subject to fishing pressure on its inshore shelf habitats. It is likely taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch in Taiwan is retained for the meat for human consumption or for fish meal production for aquaculture. In Japan, it is likely this species is retained as its relative, the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>) is retained for its meat.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch, respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita  fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu <em>et al.</em> 2014, Helgil 2019a). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish  too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish  meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity  of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC  2016).</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><br/><a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">  </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">  In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019, Helgil 2019b).</a>","The Ocellate Topeshark appears to be rare in Taiwan as it is only known from three specimens, one of which was an embryo (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). However, adults may be mistaken for the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>) which was one of the most abundant sharks in Taiwan coastal fisheries (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. <br/><br/>The landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The landings of all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks and skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. Additionally, there are anecdotal reports of catch declines during 1967–1997 of some demersal shark species that were previously considered common, with some species difficult to find by 1997 (Chen 1997). Unfortunately, this information is not species-specific.<br/><br/>In Japan, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403173"">EEZ</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ.     <br/><br/>  When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) they represent declines of 30% and 88% in Taiwan and Japan, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the spatial and depth range of the Ocellate Topeshark in Taiwan but in Japan, the range of the Ocellate Topeshark is the Ryukyu Islands that are likely not as heavily fished as the waters of mainland Japan. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort in Japan is decreasing and continuing to decline. Overall, it is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (30 years).",Decreasing,The Ocellate Topeshark is endemic to the Northwest Pacific from the Ryukyu Islands of Japan to Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a).,"No information is available on use and trade; however, it is likely used for human consumption as its closely-related relative, the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>) is valued for its meat (A.

It occurs on the outer continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 70–2,000 m, and mostly from 200 to 500 m. The species is frequently reported as incidental catch in deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and handline fisheries across its known spatial range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Off West Africa, there are a number of European distant-water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species that likely interact with this species. The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is listed as a deep-water shark species in European Union regulations, and various management actions apply to such listed deep-water sharks, including a prohibited on targeted fisheries, a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for shark bycatch in longline fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp,) and depth limits beyond which gillnets and demersal trawl fisheries are prohibited in some areas. Overall, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, some refuge at depth, and deep-water shark management across part of its range. The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) based on abundance indices and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is demersal on the outer continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 70–2,000 m, and mostly at 200–500 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 55 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 24–34 cm TL and females mature at 30–41 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a litter size of 1–21 pups and size-at-birth is 9–14 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 4.7 years and maximum age is 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 7.8 years (Coelho and Erzini 2008). <em><em><br/></em></em><em><em></em></em>","The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is reported as incidental catch in deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and handline fisheries across its range (Fauconnet<em> et al.</em> 2019, ICES-WGEF 2019). The Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean have been subject to extensive and intensive deep-water fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2009). Relative abundance of the Velvet Belly Lanternshark was highest at depths of 400–750 m (Ragonese<em> et al. </em>2013, Neat <em>et al.</em> 2015, ICES-WGEF 2019). In the Northeast Atlantic, there were a number of demersal trawl and longline fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope (Gordon 1999, ICES-WGEF 2019). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but is likely to be high based on severe injuries obtained when individuals are captured (Coelho<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walke<em>r&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/> <br/>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017) and at 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). In Mauritania, there demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish. Trawl fishing here occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at depths of 100–400 m (Cervantes<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/> There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/> <br/> West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable&#160;in the short term (FAO 2020).","In the Northeast Atlantic, the Velvet Belly Lanternshark appears to have distinct regional populations (McMillan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Species-specific population trend data are available from standardised catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices and relative abundance in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (Serena 2014, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2018, ICES-WGEF 2019, Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2020). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (23 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The trend analysis of the standardised CPUE from commercial fisheries off Portugal (1997–2016), relative abundance estimates from the Spanish Porcupine Bank scientific survey time-series (2001–2018), and relative abundance estimates from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Northern Alboran Sea, off the Balearic Islands and Northern Spain, 1994–2015), and Central Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea (1994–2011) revealed an annual rate of decline of 3.3%, consistent with an estimated population reduction of 67% over three generation lengths (23 years).<br/><br/>The trend analysis of the standardised CPUE from commercial fisheries off Portugal (1997–2016) and relative abundance estimates from the Spanish Porcupine Bank scientific survey time-series (2001–2018) revealed an annual rate of decline of 2.2%, consistent with an estimated population reduction of 35% over three generation lengths (23 years), although the highest probability is a &lt;20% population reduction over three generation lengths (Supplementary Information). The relative abundance estimates from the Mediterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Northern Alboran Sea, off the Balearic Islands and Northern Spain, 1994–2015), and Central Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea (1994–2011) revealed an annual rate of decline of 3.3%, consistent with an estimated population reduction of 67% over three generation lengths (23 years). The global weighted trend estimated a 52% population reduction over three generation lengths (23 years). The data were estimated to represent 80% of the species' known spatial distribution.<br/><br/>Across West Africa, total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950–2010, while the CPUE of artisanal and industrial vessels declined by 34% over this period (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018). Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates data are available across the Velvet Belly Lanternshark's range and while these levels of declines are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Using these reconstructed data, the regional West Africa elasmobranch CPUE is inferred to have decreased by 74%, from 0.27 t/kW to 0.07 t/kW from 1950 to 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The Velvet Belly Lanternshark has declined across its range (based on estimated and inferred reductions summarised above). The species is thought to have some refuge from fishing pressure at depth in parts of its range and there is deep-water shark management across part of its range. A global population reduction of 30–49% was estimated over three generation lengths (23 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation and the Velvet Belly Lanternshark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.",Decreasing,The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland to Gabon) and in the Mediterranean Sea (excluding the north Adriatic and Black Seas) (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).,"The species is not known to be utilized and is often discarded (Ragonese<em> et al.</em> 2013). Off Mauritania, a number of deep-water sharks, including <em>Etmopterus </em>spp., are used for their liver oil (M. Dia unpub. data 2020).",Marine,"Further information is required on population size and trends of the Velvet Belly Lanternshark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic. In 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited directed fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Velvet Belly Lanternshark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2019). Since 2017, a restrictive bycatch allowance has been trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp). Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius </em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2019).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned demersal trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005, but this is unlikely to provide considerable refuge for the species.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits shallow coastal waters at depths of 2–18 m. This is a very rare and poorly-known species with some uncertainty regarding its population status. Information on catches in large-scale and small-scale fisheries are generally lacking, although shrimp trawl fisheries and a variety of other artisanal fisheries that are likely to catch it operate across its range. Round rays are generally discarded although they may be used as bait or fishmeal by artisanal fishers. Tropical Eastern Pacific round rays have life history parameters including very early age-at-maturity (1–4 years) that demonstrate high biological productivity and therefore resilience to fishing mortality. The Fake Round Ray&#160;is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its range, with little refuge. Overall, due levels of exploitation from its exposure to inadequately managed fisheries throughout its range, its apparently restricted and patchy range, rarity, and lack of recent records in Panama, balanced with the high biological productivity of tropical Eastern Pacific round rays,&#160;it is suspected that the Fake Round Ray&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.&#160;</p>","<p>The Fake Round Ray inhabits shallow coastal waters at depths of 2–18 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Fishnet 2 Portal 2020).

These species are larger (46 and 42 cm TL, respectively) than the Fake Round Ray, and therefore this is likely to be an overestimate of generation length.</p><p></p>","This species is likely to be taken as bycatch of large-scale and small-scale shrimp trawl fisheries across its range.&#160;<br/><br/>In Panama, the entire known range of the Fake Round Ray overlaps with both large-scale (industrial) and small-scale (artisanal) fisheries. Coastal industrial shrimp trawling commenced in the 1950s with eight small fishing boats (D’Croz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1979) and currently there are around 190 licensed vessels in the industrial fleet off Panama, using beam trawls targeting shrimp (FAO 2018). Due to high fishing pressure on the zone, the shrimp landings have decreased in recent decades (CGR 2019). Within the Gulf of Panama there are fisheries for small pelagic fishes (anchovies, herrings etc.) that operate on soft-benthic coastal habitats and which catch several species of ray as bycatch, including Rogers’ Round Ray (<em>Urotrygon rogersi</em>) (CeDePesca 2016). This indicates that the Fake Round Ray would also be susceptible to capture in these fisheries. A variety of small-scale fisheries also operate within the Gulf of Panama with little management (~1,500 registered artisanal vessels in the Province of Panama alone; ARAP 2015). There are no recent records of the species in Panama, and given its shallow depth range, it likely has little refuge from fishing.<br/><br/>Overall, there is high spatial overlap with fisheries (which generally lack management or effective enforcement of regulations across most of its range), and given the geographic and depth range of the species, it has no refuge from fishing activities that operate across its range.","There are no data available on population trend of the Fake Round Ray. It is a rare species, with very few records. During 2019, a concerted effort was made to search for new records of this species in Panama through engagement with fishers, fisheries observers, and seafood markets, however no records or information on its contemporary occurrence could be ascertained (J.M.

124477382,161397,Torpedo torpedo,Vulnerable,A2bd,2021,2020-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Ocellate Torpedo (<em>Torpedo torpedo</em>) is a small (to 60 cm total length) torpedo ray that occurs in the Eastern and Central Atlantic Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea (absent from the Black Sea). It is demersal on the continental shelf and slope from nearshore to a depth of 320 m.<br/><br/>This species is taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo</em> spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., across the Mediterranean Sea and Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of this species. In the Mediterranean Sea, trend analyses of standardized catch-per-unit effort estimates from trawl surveys in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea reveal an increasing population over the past three generation lengths (30 years). However, in other locations such as the Adriatic Sea, records of this species have become rare over the last two decades. In the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which comprises most of the species' range, there are a number of distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species. In Mauritania, catch data from research surveys indicate a decline equivalent to a 73% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (30 years). Across the rest of this region, there are few recent records from most countries, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent studies in the area. The Ocellate Torpedo is estimated to be stable and increasing in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea. It is suspected to be declining across West Africa where historic and current fishing pressure is high, although it might have some refuge from artisanal fisheries with depth across some of its range. It is suspected that the Ocellate Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Ocellate Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates on the continental shelf&#160;and slope from nearshore&#160;to a depth of 320 m (Gulyugin&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL), males mature at 18 cm TL and females mature at 22 cm TL(Abdel-Aziz 1994). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays,&#160;with litter sizes of 3–21 pups and size-at-birth of 8–10 cm TL (Serena 2005). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>). The Marbled Torpedo has an age-at-maturity of 12 years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971). The Ocellate Torpedo has a smaller maximum size than the Marbled Torpedo  (60 cm vs 100 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length was inferred to be 10 years for the Ocellate Torpedo.","The Ocellate Torpedo is taken as incidental catch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. Information on post-release survival is limited, but it is suspected to be high (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the Ocellate Torpedo is sometimes landed in fisheries as bycatch. This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonart and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras <em>et al</em>. 2015). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker et al. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutiérrez et al. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats, which are part of this species range, are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., for rice and salt production) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). For example, in West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2005). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (30 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE ) estimates from trawl surveys (1985–2004) in the upper Tyrrhenian Sea (central region of the Mediterranean Sea) revealed an annual rate of increase of 5%, consistent with an estimated increasing population over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/>There are a number of other relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>First, in the Mediterranean Sea, surveys indicate that the Ocellate Torpedo is generally uncommon and less abundant than the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>). It was recorded in 28 of 6,336 hauls conducted during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) programme in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, from 1994–1999 at depths of 10-800 m (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). In similar MEDITS surveys in the western Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands) from 1994–2017, 11 specimens were recorded in the Northern Alboran Sea (Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2020). MEDITS catch data was also compared from the Adriatic Sea in 1998 with that the Hvar survey in 1948 and indicated that although this species was rarely recorded in the past, it was not recorded in the 1998 trawl surveys (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). Further investigation of these datasets and additional trawl surveys in the Adriatic Sea (to 2005) indicates that only two individuals were captured in this region in 1996 and 2003 (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2013). There are no other data to indicate population size, although the lack of recent records could be an indication of decline.<br/>&#160;<br/>Second, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch CPUE has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Third, contemporary patterns of landings indicate that while there are limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, it appears to be more common than other torpedo rays occurring in the region (e.g., Rosette Torpedo (<em>Torpedo bauchotae</em>)). The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004–2006, this species was present in 24.8% of the total catches and contributed 0.5% in weight (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). Twenty-seven individuals were also recorded during research trawl surveys carried out between 2007–2010 in Mauritanian waters, representing 0.12% of the total number of fishing hauls in which the species occurred (Pascual-Alayon <em>et al</em>. 2017). This was species has not been reported in regular monitoring of fisheries landings between 2006–2018 undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin which could, however, indicate that it is discarded by fishers (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). However, in research trawl fishing surveys, CPUE peaked at 24.6 kg/tow in 1988 and declined to 7.2 kg/tow in 2018 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent of 73% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Ocellate Torpedo (30 years). <br/><br/>During extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004–2011, this species was recorded across all countries except Cape Verde (where it does not occur) and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). However, historical data from Sierra Leone indicates that this species was considered common and abundant (Litvinov 1993) and a lack of records in landings could indicate that they are discarded there. In Senegal, it was also recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985–1988 (Mar 2008). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that 42 individuals were caught in 1984 (Lhomme 1984). It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). On the other hand, it has not been detected in recent surveys in of the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau; in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained here despite its low economic value); in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded here); in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries); and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). Landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 indicate that this species represents 7% of ray landings (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species is still captured but discarded alive and it is also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and is also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys and represented up to 10.9% of catches and up to 30 individuals in one trawl haul in surveys between Guinea and Morocco in 2011 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011), up to 7.2% of catches and up to 65 individuals per trawl haul, and up to 2.1% of catches and up to eight individuals per trawl haul in Gabon and Congo, in 2008 and 2010 respectively (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160; However, it was not listed in more recent cruise reports in Angola and northern Namibia in 2012 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2012) and in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana in 2017 (Staby <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The Ocellate Torpedo is estimated to be stable and increasing in some areas of the Mediterranean Sea although in other regions of this basin, there has been a long history of fisheries overexploitation across its range which is ongoing. It is suspected to be declining across West Africa where historic and current fishing pressure is high although it might have some refuge from artisanal fisheries with depth across some of its range. Overall, it is suspected that the Ocellate Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span>",Decreasing,"The Ocellate Torpedo is found in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea (although absent from the Black Sea) and occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago but is found around São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe&#160;(Afonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo </em>spp.) have low economic value and have generally been discarded in the Mediterranean Sea and West Africa or used for human consumption (fresh or dried and smoked) and animal feed (e.g., Diop and Dossa 2011, Tiralongo <em>et al</em>. 2018; E. Chartrain, I. Seidu and A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). The Ocellate Torpedo may be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas <em>et al</em>. 2019).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the range of the Ocellate Torpedo have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking this species are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of its range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2016).

While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat for export to Ghana and fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and likely resulted in increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>)&#160;from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p><span style="""">In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010 - these were mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span></p><p><span style="""">Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region and which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">the reported legal catch by&#160;</span><span style="""">more than 40% (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</span></p><span style="""">The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats preferred by rays are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years. The highest loses recorded from are from Côte d'Ivoire&#160;(67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, CCLME 2016).&#160;</span>","<span style="""">Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in the Mediterranean Sea (Serena&#160;2014). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (23 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category based on percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;</span>The trend analysis of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates from demersal trawl surveys (1994–2010; 16 years) in Sardinia revealed an annual rate of decrease of 0.9%, although in recent years the trend was increasing and when measured over the longer three generation period (23 years), there was an estimated increase of 0.5% over three generation lengths with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths.<br/><span style=""""></span><span style=""""></span><br/><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">There are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic, and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2011,&#160;Watson</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2013,&#160;Belhabib</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2018).</span><br/><br/><span style="""">First, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Stingray was recorded in 49 of 6,336 hauls (0.5% of total hauls) conducted during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) program in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, from 1994 to 1999 at depths of 50</span><span style="""">–800 m (Baino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).

In Lebanon and Syria, this species is reported as one of the most common rays (Bariche 2012). In Tunisia, it is also considered relatively abundant and 17 individuals were captured during fisheries surveys&#160;between 2006–2007 in the&#160;Lagoon of Bizerte (Bradai <em>et al.</em> 2004, El Kamel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;Off&#160;the coast of Turkey, between 2009–2010, 391 individuals were captured in 116 hauls by commercial demersal trawl in&#160;the Gulf of Antalya,&#160;representing a 56% frequency of&#160;occurrence; and 72 individuals were captured&#160;between 2014–2015&#160;in commercial trawl operations&#160;in Iskenderun Bay&#160;(Özgür Özbek&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Yeldan and&#160;Gundogdu 2018).&#160;However, CPUE comparisons with a previous survey in the Gulf of Antalya suggest declines in abundance over 17 years (</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Özgür Özbek&#160;</span><em style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2015).&#160;</span>An experimental trawl fishery in the Aegean Sea (Izmir Bay, Turkey) revealed that this species was a relatively prevalent non-commercial species, representing up to 1.89% of the total catch by weight during the winter months, 1.78% in the spring, 1.18% in the autumn but was not recorded in the summer (Gurbet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;In Russian waters of the Black Sea, pressure from fisheries has declined in recent years due to the lack of demand at fish markets (A. Orlov pers. comm. 11 December 2020). Annual average catches between 1976–1980 were 367 t which decreased to 10–15 t between 2001–2003 due to reduced fishing pressure and the Common Stingray is reportedly still abundant in the Azov Sea (Vasil'eva and Luzhnyak 2013).

Overall, in the Mediterranean Sea, the Common Stingray appears to have declined in certain regions but is still relatively abundant in others, especially along the North African coast and southern central region.<p>Second, in the Northeast Atlantic, this species is less abundant than in the Mediterranean Sea and it has reportedly disappeared from the south of the Bay of Biscay, as observed for other demersal elasmobranch species (Quero 1998). However, the species has appeared in very low quantities in French landings from this area and Iberian waters between 1999 and 2012, ranging from 0 to 3 t per year. The average catch rate (number per hour) during the first quarter of the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat (1977–2004) was 0.0006 (ICES 2005).

It inhabits soft substrates over the continental shelf to a depth of 110 m. This guitarfish is captured in commercial demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and by artisanal gillnets and longlines. Artisanal fisheries operate without management throughout most of its range (or with inadequate enforcement of regulations), and shrimp trawling occurs in the Gulf of California, off Mazatlan, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador.

These fisheries have driven declines in turtles, marine mammals, and pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). In San Felipe, Mexico, guitarfish species made up over 22% of elasmobranch bycatch in a study on the industrial teleost trawl fishery (Godinez-Padilla and Castillo-Geniz 2016). It makes up a small percentage of the bycatch in industrial shrimp trawls in Guatemala (Ixquiac-Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 2010). Shrimp trawl fisheries operate in Costa Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador, but there are no data regarding catches of this species. Artisanal fisheries operate without management throughout the southern portion of its range. This species does not have any refuge at depth.","In the Gulf of California artisanal fishery, annual landings of the Speckled Guitarfish have been steadily increasing from approximately 200 t in 1997 to 700 t in 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2016), and there is no management in place. Declines in other species including turtles, marine mammals, and pelagic sharks and rays&#160;have been recorded in the southern Gulf of California multi-species artisanal gillnet fishery (Sala<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2004<em></em>), and declines in guitarfishes are also likely.&#160;In Costa Rica, it was historically recorded in the Gulf of Nicoya which is heavily fished by industrial and artisanal trawl fisheries, but recent records are sparse. In Panama, Del Cid (2011) recorded only two individuals during nearly two years of monitoring the catch of artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of Chiriquí. There is also a lack of confirmed recent records in Colombia. It is unclear if this contemporary rarity reflects a reduced population or if the species has always been rarer in the southern part of its range. The species' range throughout Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador is however, subjected to high fishing pressure. Overall, given the intensity of unmanaged fishing pressure throughout its range and the increase in landings in the Gulf of California, it is suspected that the Speckled Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49%&#160;over the past three generations (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Speckled Guitarfish occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Magdalena Bay, Mexico to Ecuador, including the Gulf of California (Godinez-Padilla and Castillo-Geniz 2016, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).",This guitarfish is retained in multi-species fisheries and the meat is dried and sold locally.,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in   place for this guitarfish. In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted   elasmobranch fishing   from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is   inadequate (O.   Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. Management measures are needed in order to ensure that this ray does not become threatened in the near future. Further research is   needed on life   history and population size and trends, and species-specific monitoring of   catch is  needed in industrial trawl and    artisanal gillnet and longline  fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelves and slopes from 25 to 1,435 m, but is most common from 70 to 480 m deep. It is captured in mainly in demersal trawl, longline, gillnet, and dredge fisheries. Historically, this species underwent very steep declines coinciding with high levels of demersal fishing from international fleets targeting shelf and slope groundfish. The extension of Exclusive Economic Zones out to 200 nautical miles in 1977 restricted fishing access to the USA and Canadian vessels. Effort was renewed on skates with the encouragement of directed skate fisheries as other groundfish fisheries collapsed in the USA and Canadian waters in the late 1980s and 1990s, and as international demand for skate wings increased. Population trends vary with latitude with very steep reductions in the northern (Newfoundland and Labrador Shelf, 2J3K) and central (Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy, Canada, 4VWX) parts of its range. There have been increases in the easternmost part of the range (Grand Banks, 3LNOPs) and signs of recovery in the southern part of is range in the USA. The overall index suggests a steep decline in abundance from the mid-1960s until the mid-1990s, followed by increasing abundance to the present day. The overall annual rate of decrease of 1.08% is consistent with an estimated median decline of 36.1% over three generation lengths (48 years), with the highest probability (62%) of &gt;30% reduction over three generation lengths. Predation from recovering populations of Grey Seal (<em>Halichoerus grypus</em>) is estimated to have caused high levels of adult mortality in the Gulf of St Lawrence and which may be inhibiting recovery there. Overall, while the population trend is currently increasing, there have been substantial declines in the past and only limited recovery in some areas of its range. Mortality is ongoing from both bycatch and predation from Grey Seals in the Gulf of St Lawrence, and overall, this skate is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations. Therefore, the Smooth Skate is assessed as Vulnerable (A2bd).<br/></p><p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Smooth Skate is demersal on continental shelves and slopes at depths of&#160; 25–1,435 m and is most common at 70<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">–480 m <span lang=""EN-US"">(Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

Skate landings (of all species combined) reached 9,500 mt in 1969, but declined quickly during the 1970s, falling to 800 mt in 1981 (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). While most skates were discarded between 1983–2002, in the USA, but the increasing value of skate wings and demand for lobster bait in recent years has resulted in increased retention and landings, with discard rates declining from 90% to 40% over time and landings have increasing from 883 to 16,283 t per year (Curtis and Sosebee 2015).&#160;Overall fishing effort in the region’s trawl and gillnet fisheries declined during the 2000s due to changing groundfish regulations (Curtis and Sosebee 2015). Smooth Skates are too small to be marketable in the USA skate wing fishery (NEFMC 2003). Possession and landing have been prohibited&#160;in the bulk of the species' USA range&#160;since 2003 due to their low levels of relative abundance (NEFMC 2003). <a>Any live discards</a>&#160;have moderate post-release survival; from the USA New England otter trawl fishery the 72-hour post-release mortality is 60% (Mandelman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Smooth Skate was overfished up to the 2000, but soon after was classified as no longer overfished (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). This stock is currently classified as not overfished, it is rebuilt, and overfishing is not occurring (Sosebee 2018).<br/><br/>Historically in the northwest Atlantic,<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;skates were taken as incidental catch of groundfish fisheries with high fishing effort, particularly distant water fleets on Georges&#160;Bank and Scotian Shelf, Grand Banks and Labrador Shelf in the 1960s and 1970s.

A targeted skate fishery (primarily for Thorny Skate, <em>Amblyraja radiata</em>) was initiated in 1994 on the Grand Banks and Scotian Shelf, following the closure of groundfish fisheries (as a result of the collapse of Atlantic Cod, <em>Gadus morhua</em>) combined with the rising international demand for skate wings (Kulka and Mowbray 1999). Target fisheries for Smooth Skate are not currently allowed, but it continues to be taken as discarded bycatch of trawl fisheries for Atlantic Cod, Redfish (<em>Sebastes</em> spp.), and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) (COSEWIC 2012).<br/><br/>Groundfishes, including skates, have been heavily fished historically in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence.

In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a high level of exploitation on the continental shelf and upper slope to about 800 m depth (Massuti and Moranta 2003, Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2005). Smoothhounds&#160;are captured by demersal trawls, trammel nets, gillnets and longlines in this region (Bauchot 1987). Semi-industrial fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, off Sicily, Spain and Cyprus are known to take these species, and also artisanal fisheries elsewhere. Smoothhounds&#160;are retained and used in the Mediterranean Sea, where they are regularly sold for human consumption in many areas (Fischer&#160;<em>et al. </em>1987).</p>  <p></p><p>Smoothhounds have shown signs of depletion in the Mediterranean Sea, although they may be locally abundant in some areas (STECF 2003). Landings of smoothhounds are often grouped as “smoothhounds nei” in landing statistics and therefore no species-specific data are available from the region. Furthermore, at least for Italian catches, reported catches do not correspond with the taxonomic group, but an aggregation of small demersal sharks, including true smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus&#160;</em>spp.), spurdogs (<em>Squalus&#160;</em>spp<em>.</em>)<em>,</em>&#160;gulper sharks&#160;(<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp.), the Kitefin Shark (<em>Dalatias licha</em>), catsharks (<em>Scyliorhinus</em>&#160;spp.), and the Blackmouth Catshark (<em>Galeus melastomus</em>). This is because these species are usually marketed headless, skinned, and eviscerated, and sold under the commercial name of “palombo”: the Italian name for smoothhounds. Direct observations by experts are required to collect species-specific data for catches of true smoothhounds, as these sharks can be difficult to identify for non-biologist observers.</p>","<p>Very little information is available on&#160;the&#160;population trend of the&#160;Blackspotted Smoothhound, partly due to confusion with the more common species of smoothhound within&#160;its&#160;range. It seems to be very rare in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea where surveys have been undertaken. It was recorded in only one of 6,336 hauls during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) programme (at depths of 50−800 m) from 1994−1999 (Baino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Jukic-Peladic (2001) compared MEDITS catch data from the Adriatic Sea in 1998 with that from the Hvar survey in 1948. The Blackspotted Smoothhound was not reported from either survey, whereas the Common Smoothhound (<em>M. mustelus</em>) and Starry Smoothhound (<em>M. asterias</em>) were present in both. The Blackspotted Smoothhound was also absent from bottom trawl surveys conducted off the Balearic Islands between 1998−2001, at depths of 40−1,800 m (Massutí and Moranta 2003).</p><p>The Italian survey programme ""Gruppo Nazionale Risorse Demersali"" (GRUND) carried out over 22 surveys in Italian waters between 1985−1998. The percentage presence of this species was low (2.48%) and very few specimens were caught in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea, northern central Adriatic Sea, and south of Sicily (Relini&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000).&#160;Scientific trawl surveys caught this species mostly in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Geographical Sub-areas 16 (Strait of Sicily) and 17 (northern Adriatic Sea) with the average catch rate per hour ranging between 0.6 and 1.7, respectively. From 2008 to 2012, the catch of this species progressively declined, especially in the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Division 37.1.3 (Sardinia) and 37.2.2 (Ionian Sea) areas where catches declined by 75% (from 1.43–0.36 t per year) and 37% (from 33.32–20.87 t per year), respectively. In FAO Division 37.2.1 (Adriatic Sea), the landings remained relatively consistent (between 172 and 311 t per year; Serena&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>This species is apparently more common in parts of the North African coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It is common along the Tunisian coasts and seems to be most abundant towards the south in the Gulf of Gabès and along the coast of Libya (Bradaï&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). Its status in northwest Africa remains unknown.</p><p>Considering the population decline data available from the Mediterranean for the period 2008−2012, and its more common abundance elsewhere, it is suspected that the Blackspotted Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over three past three generation lengths (54 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Blackspotted Smoothhound occurs throughout coastal and continental shelf waters of&#160;the Mediterranean Sea&#160;(but is absent from the Black Sea) with its range extending to the Eastern Central Atlantic (Western Sahara) (Serena 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p>","<p>Smoothhounds are&#160;commercially valuable in the Mediterranean Sea&#160;and northwestern Africa, where&#160;they are retained and marketed for human consumption of the meat either&#160;fresh, frozen, or salted and dried.</p>",Marine,"<p>No species-specific management or conservation measures are currently in place in the Mediterranean Sea or northwestern Africa.

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–150 m, though mainly at 80–90 m. This skate is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and set nets, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal.<br/><br/>No species-specific population trend data are available. Catches of skates and rays from the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the South Korea and China EEZs indicate declines of 30–91% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the species’ entire range. Regional congeners have been reported as  common in some areas and to have high biological productivity, which  would provide some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Bigeye Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The Bigeye Skate is demersal on sand and mud habitats of the continental shelf at depths of 30–150 m, though mainly at 80–90 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 38 cm total length (TL), males are mature by 31 cm TL and females size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Two congeners of similar size and depth ranges, the Spiny Skate (<em>O. kenojei</em>) and the Sharpspine Skate (<em>O. acutispina</em>) have female ages-at-maturity of 3.4 and 7.2 years and maximum ages of 10.5 and 13.2 years (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002, Joung <em>et al.</em> 2011), resulting in generation lengths of 6.9 and 10.2 years, respectively. It is thus inferred that the generation length of the Bigeye Skate is on the lower side of 7–10 years.</p>","<p>The Bigeye Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch, and is possibly targeted in South Korea, in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including demersal trawl, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption or fish meal. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Bigeye Skate. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017).</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however, they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019).&#160;</p>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon<em> et al. </em>2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). </p>","<p>There are no species-specific trend data for this species. In the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the catch of skates and rays from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort, which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan EEZ. </p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea and China EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). </p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (21 years), they represent declines of 56–70%, 80–91%, and 30–41% in Japan, South Korea, and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Spiny Skate. Congeners of similar size, depth, and range have been reported as common in some areas and to have high biological productivity, which would provide some resilience to fishing pressure (see Red List assessments of Spiny Skate (<em>O. kenojei</em>) and the Sharpspine Skate (<em>O. acutispina</em>)).

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019).

It inhabits the outer continental  shelf and upper slope on soft substrates at depths of 73–515 m. It has relatively fast growth rates and matures at a moderate age of 9 years. The Yellowspotted Skate is captured and retained in demersal trawl and line fisheries that operate throughout most of its range, although some remote parts of southern Namibia may offer refuge from fishing pressure. Trend analysis of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas estimated a population reduction of 46% over the past three generation lengths (36 years). The species has exhibited a southwest range shift with some potential  loss of habitat area during 1981–2016, likely due to climate change. Overall, due to an estimated reduction in population size over part of   its range, combined with some  areas of its range with low fishing pressure that may offer refuge, it is suspected  that the Yellowspotted Skate has undergone a  population reduction of  30–49% over the past three generation lengths  (36 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Yellowspotted Skate is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope on soft substrates at depths of 73–515 m, but is most common at 150–300 m (Smale 2009, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 96 cm total length (TL);  males mature at 64 cm TL, and females mature at 73 cm TL off the west coast, and 75 cm TL off the south coast of South Africa (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous, with the number of egg cases laid unknown, but the reproductive cycle is possibly annual as egg cases are laid only in March-May; size-at-birth is 16 cm TL (Walmsley-Hart <em>et al.</em> 1999, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). The species has relatively fast growth rates, at <em>k</em>=0.27 for males and <em>k</em>=0.26 for females (Walmsley-Hart <em>et al. </em>1999). Female age-at-maturity is 9 years and maximum age is 15 years; generation length is therefore 12 years (Walmsley-Hart <em>et al.</em> 1999).","<p>The Yellowspotted Skate is mainly captured by deep-water trawl fisheries  targeting hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp) and crustaceans in South Africa and Mozambique, respectively, and is sometimes retained. It is also likely taken in commercial line fisheries in South Africa (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). Trawl fisheries operate throughout most of its range but in South Africa, trawl effort has decreased over the past two decades (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 20 April 2018). The crustacean trawl fishery from Durban into southern Mozambique operates at 100–600 m depth (Fennessy and Groenveld 1997). Effort in that fishery, however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time, for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 24 April 2018). Intense small-scale trawl fishing in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013) may threaten this species. Some parts of southern Namibia are remote and may offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Yellowspotted Skate has exhibited a southwest range shift and a loss of habitat area over three decades from 1981–2016 in South Africa, possibly as a result of climate change (Currie <em>et al. </em>2019). This may represent a loss of habitat for this species.</p>","<strong></strong>There are no estimates of population size for the Yellowspotted Skate. Population trend data of annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016) in commercially fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast&#160;by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF unpubl. data 2018). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (36 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 1.7% over the trawl grounds, consistent with an estimated reduction of 46.3% over the past three generation lengths (36 years), with the highest probability (41.6%) of a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths. The research trawl survey gear was modified in recent years and is now very inefficient at catching skates, which could account for some recent decline in research catch rates (R. Leslie unpubl. data 2018). This species is abundant along the west and south coast of South Africa, but less prevalent on the east coast of South Africa and Mozambique: individuals were observed in only two of 508 research trawls in  Mozambique and 11  of 749 trawls in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa from 2003 to 2012  (S. Fennessy, Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data  2018). There is some trawling in Namibia, but parts of it are remote with no fishing pressure.

It occurs in shallow coastal waters to a depth of 60 m.<br/><br/>This species is taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, set net, and trammel net fisheries across its range. Panrays have low economic value and while retained in some countries for local consumption (e.g., Senegal and Mauritania), they are discarded and not utilized in others because even though the meat is edible, they are small and are difficult to skin (e.g., The Gambia). Panrays are often landed still alive and therefore are likely to have high post-release survival. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across most of the range of the Striped Panray. In Mauritania, catch data from research surveys indicate a decline equivalent to a &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years).<br/><br/>Overall, although there are population reductions reported from Mauritania, it is still landed in most countries across its range and considered relatively common. This is a small species and may be relatively biologically productive compared to larger sharks and rays, thus able to sustain higher levels of exploitation. However, considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Striped Panray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) based on time-series data and actual of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.<span style=""""><br/></span>","The Striped Panray is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters to 60 m depth (Gulyugin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016,&#160;Séret 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL) with males mature at&#160;~30 cm TL and females mature at&#160;~37–40 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litters sizes of 1–4 pups, a gestation length of about 5 months, and a size-at-birth of ~19 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).

The Chinese Fanray has an age-at-maturity of three years and a maximum age of 12 years and, thus, a generation length of 7.5 years (Kume&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). The&#160;Chinese Fanray&#160;has a smaller maximum size than the&#160;Striped&#160;Panray (50 cm vs 60 cm TL), and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred to be 9&#160;<span style="""">y</span>ears for the&#160;Striped&#160;Panray.","The Striped Panray is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. It is often landed still alive and therefore is likely to have high post-release survival (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez et al. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats of this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that the Striped Panray is still relatively abundant across its range. The pattern of retention and discarding of panrays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The Striped Panray was recorded in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea during landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004–2011 (Diop and Dossa 2011). In a study investigating discards in Mauritanian shrimp fisheries between 2004 and 2006, this species was present in 0.2% of the total catches and contributed 5.8% in weight [recorded as <em>Zanobatus atlanticus</em>] (Goudswaard and Meissa 2006). It was also considered relatively common during bottom trawl surveys undertaken in Mauritania in May and June 2005 with frequent aggregations recorded (Gulyugin <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>In Mauritania, this species has not been reported in regular monitoring of fisheries landings between 2006–2018 undertaken by the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin which could, however, indicate that it is absent or more likely that it is discarded by artisanal fishers (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). On the other hand, in research trawl fishing surveys, catch-per-unit-effort peaked at 20.4 kg/tow in 1988 and declined to 1.39 kg/tow in 2016 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). This decrease is the equivalent to &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Striped Panray (27 years). <br/><br/>In The Gambia, individuals were frequently observed in abundance during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010–2018 (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Here, whole fresh or desiccated individuals were found discarded on the ground around fishing communities. It was also recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985 to 2012 (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cruise reports from the ""Fridtjof Nansen"" research surveys indicate that low numbers of this species (between four and six individuals per tow representing 0.59 and 1.34% of catches respectively) were caught during surveys in the Gulf of Guinea (Morocco to Guinea) in 2011 (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011). Cruise reports from trawl surveys in Togo indicate that seven individuals were recorded in 1984 (Lhomme 1984). In Ghana, the Striped Panray was recorded in demersal fishing surveys undertaken by the Japan International Cooperation Agency between 2000–2003. These trawl surveys operated at depths between 20–100 m and recorded 14 individuals in 10 tows (5.1% of tows) (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006). Approximately 10 individuals were landed per day at sites visited in Western Ghana during surveys in 2019 and 2020, representing 7% of ray landings, although these records are likely aggregated with, and undifferentiated from, the Maculate Panray (<em>Zanobatus maculatus</em>) records (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, 38 individuals have been recorded (often landed alive) over two years of landing site surveys representing 1.7% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). It has not been detected in recent surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago); in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019; and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). This lack of records could either be due to biogeographic absence or species depletion, although the latter seems unlikely given the small size of the species and the low interest in its utilization. Therefore, the real reason for this lack of records cannot be determined at this point and further monitoring is warranted. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, panrays are relatively commonly captured, and they are also infrequently recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets, but these records might also be aggregated with the Maculate Panray (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There are a number of relevant datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. Average elasmobranch landings in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, of the three major fishing nations, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and while population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Although there are population reductions reported from Mauritania equivalent to &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (27 years), it is still landed in most countries across its range and considered relatively common. Considering the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Striped Panray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) based on time-series data and actual of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Striped Panray is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Morocco to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has not been recorded from the Cape Verde Archipelago or São Tomé and Príncipe (Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The Striped Panray is either discarded or retained as utilized bycatch across its range. In some countries, like The Gambia, it is often found discarded on the beach and not utilized&#160;because even though the meat is edible, it is small and is difficult to skin (Ishihara and Kimoto 2006, Last<em> et al. </em>2016, Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). However, in Mauritania, it is processed (salted and dried) for export to Nigeria where it is used for local consumption (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). In Senegal, interviews with fishers indicate that it is always landed because the meat is in demand. It is considered tender and is consumed fresh or salted and dried and more expensive than other species of rays (e.g., <em>Fontitrygon</em> spp.) (L. Badji unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Striped Panray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal from inshore to offshore waters of the continental shelf to an estimated maximum depth of 200 m. The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing  gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due  to its small size with a likely low post release survival rate. Inferred and suspected declines over three generation lengths (15 years) range from 23–97%, although across most of its range the declines are 23–50% and across most of that area, fishing pressure is high. Based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the Chinese Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Chinese Numbfish is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to offshore waters. The depth range is unknown but suspected to be 1–200 m (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 35 cm total length (TL), males mature at 24–27 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with one litter of 15 embyros reported from Taiwan, and size-at-birth is ~11 cm TL (Last<em> et al. </em>2016, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Chinese Numbfish (75 vs 35 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Chinese Numbfish. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","<p>  </p><p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded In Taiwan and China due to its small size that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), but is retained for local consumption and 'trash fish' in Malaysia and Cambodia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Post release survival is likely low, as <em>Narcine</em> species are soft bodied and easily damaged (Carvalho <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). Since the 1980s, demersal  trawls are the dominant gear followed by purse seines and small-scale  gear (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000  in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase  in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the  catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture  (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, by the 1980s overfishing was apparent (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares<em> et al. </em>2014). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020a). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the  70s led to fully exploited inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and  Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950  across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <span lang=""EN-AU""><a name=""_Hlk46146531"">The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014</a>. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorised vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al. </em>2015, Mizrahi<em> et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly et al. 2020). The demand for seafood is  very high in Myanmar, with per capita fish consumption steeply  increasing over the last two decades to 48–52 kg per capita in 2013–2016  (FAO 2020b, Helgil 2020b). In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation. There were  about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the  early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to  11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000  trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and  fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 2 February 2017).  Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction   and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang   2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). </p>    <p></p><p>  </p>  <p></p>","In China and Taiwan, the Chinese Numbfish is infrequently observed with no information on changes in abundance over time (J. Zhang and H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed landings showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In east coast Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed landings showed a 30% decline from a peak of 17,604 t in 1999 to 12,314 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1990s, dropped during the early 2000s then rose to the 2014 landings. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in the east coast Peninsular Malaysia. In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In the Philippines, from 1976 to 2006, the landings of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries decreased by 76% over 16 years from 1991 to 2006. The annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014). The population of the Chinese Numbfish is suspected to have declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Chinese Numbfish (15 years), they represent declines of 23%, 76%, 97%, 30% and 50% in China, Philippines, Cambodia, east coast Peninsular Malaysia, and India, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The declines range from 23–97%, although across most of its range, the declines are 39–50%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Chinese Numbfish.

In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019). There are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline  and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas  accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively  (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, active fishing gears, including trawlers, were prohibited in 1998 within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020a). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D.

In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T.

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 65–87 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. There are no species-specific time series, although although catch-per-unit effort of all rays has remained stable in the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) over 17 years. Elsewhere, all rays combined from the Philippine EEZ, and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the China, Viet Nam, and Borneo EEZs infer declines of 41–98% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Although these are not species-specific they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the species’ range, yet it is still considered common in Taiwan and Viet Nam which suggests that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Yellow Spotted Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (31 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The Yellow Spotted Skate is demersal on sandy and muddy habitats of the inner-continental shelf at depths of 65–87 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~45 cm total length (TL), males mature at 30 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is oviparous. Ages are inferred from the similar-sized Sharpspine Skate (<em>Okamejei acutispina</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 7.2 years and a maximum age of 13.2 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.2 years (Joung<em> et al.</em> 2011). </p>","<p>The Yellow Spotted Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, and possibly set net and gillnet, and retained for human consumption and fish meal. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Yellow Spotted Skate. </p>  <p>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China being the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).  </p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884618""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).&#160;</p>  <p>  </p><p>  </p><p>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in industrial demersal trawl and longline fisheries that operate in depths of 30–150 m (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Yellow Spotted Skate. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020a). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). </p>  <p>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). </p>  <p>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently  rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this  comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In northwest Sarawak, this species is occasionally captured by trawl fisheries (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).</p>","<p>In Taiwan, this species is considered common (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), although there is no information on population trends over time. In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the  catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years,  that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers.  comm. 28/08/2019). In China, there has been no observed change in the Yellow Spotted Skate abundance at fish markets over the past 10–15 years (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), but there is no concurrent effort data to determine a population trend. In Viet Nam, this species is considered to be common and observed quite often at commercial landing sites (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020), although there is no data to a determine population trend.<br/> </p><p>  </p><p>Landings data are available on all combined ray species from the Philippines EEZ (NFRDI 2017). In the Philippines, during 1976–2006, the landings of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries decreased by 76% over 16 years from 1991 to 2006. The annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). These declines in landings of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014).</p><p>  </p>  <p></p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for China, Viet Nam, and Borneo EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline, in landings over 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings  of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014.  Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the  mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a  peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750  t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays,  and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the  1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings  (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). <span lang=""EN-AU"">In Sarawak, Borneo,  reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 50% decline  from a peak of 14,690 t in 1997 to 7,300 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to 1980, dropped then peaked again in 1995<span lang=""EN-AU"">–1997 before sharply declining. <span lang=""EN-AU"">Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in Borneo.</span></p>  <p></p>  <p></p><p>  </p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a></p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Yellow Spotted Skate (31 years), they represent declines of 95%, 41%, 98%, and 72% in the Philippines, China, Viet Nam, and Sarawak, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of  exploitation’) is high across the spatial and depth range of the Yellow  Spotted Skate. Yet, the species is still considered common in Taiwan and  Viet Nam which suggests that the species likely has some resilience to  fishing pressure. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan  may afford the Yellow Spotted Skate some refuge.

Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).

This skate is genetically indistinguishable throughout its range, yet it exhibits marked life history differences on either side of the Atlantic and in different parts of the Northwest Atlantic, growing more slowly, maturing later and reaching a larger maximum size in the southern extent of their Northwest Atlantic distribution.&#160;The generation length is 16 years in the Northwest Atlantic (south) and 10.6 years elsewhere. It was subject to intensive target fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic and taken as bycatch in mainly trawl, but also longline and gillnet, fisheries in the USA and Canadian waters south of the Laurentian Channel (Georges Bank and Scotian Shelf). In the USA, commercial retention of Thorny Skate was banned 2003, but it is still taken as bycatch and discarded from trawl fisheries. In Canada on the Scotian Shelf, target fisheries ended in 2002 and any bycatch is now discarded. In the Northeast Atlantic, this skate has limited value and it is generally discarded and has a low discard mortality. Population trends and management vary widely, resulting in different status and trends throughout its range. On both sides of the Atlantic, the southern-most populations of this boreal species have shifted northward in response to climate-change induced habitat shifting and alteration, which, in combination with earlier intensive fishing, resulted in very steep declines (&gt;80% reduction in three generations) in the most southerly parts of its distribution. At more northerly latitudes, earlier levels of exploitation have ceased or greatly decreased resulting in recovery and increasing abundance. Overall, Thorny skate has undergone an estimated population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (32–48 years) due the combination of exploitation with habitat shifting and alteration due to climate change at lower latitudes while, further north, earlier levels of exploitation that have ceased or greatly decreased and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.</p><p><a name=""_GoBack""></a></p><p>&#160;<br/></p>","<p>The Thorny Skate is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes from nearshore to 1,400 m depths, usually at 25–440 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;There is regional variation in maximum size, it reaches a maximum size of 66 cm&#160;total length (TL)&#160;(North Sea) to 111 cm (NW Atlantic)&#160;(Walker 1998, Ebert<em> </em>and Stehmann 2013).&#160;Reproduction is oviparous with fecundity ranging from 10 to 45 egg cases per year (Templeman 1987), but only 38% of eggs hatching (COSEWIC 2012).

This species is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries in the North Sea (Northeast Atlantic), but it is not targeted and is usually discarded (Walker and Heessen 1996).&#160;<a>The Thorny Skate is a boreo-Arctic species, consequently, some areas of former habitat have become less suitable as water temperature increases, resulting in northward distribution shifts and&#160;</a><a><span lang=""EN-US"">declines in the southern parts of its distributional range, particularly in the North Sea (Sguotti&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), and northward shifts have been documented for the Scotian Shelf (Stuart <em>et al. </em>2020) as well as in the&#160;</a>Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland (<a><span lang=""EN-US"">Pinsky <em>et al. </em>2013).</span></a></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of&#160;Thorny Skate.&#160;Population trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020).

Overall, the annual rate of increase of 1.7% is consistent with a rapid increase of 1.4% in the most recent generation and an estimated median increase of 8.5%% over the past three generation lengths (31.8 years) (see Supplementary Information figure 2).<br/><br/>Third, the trend analysis of the North Atlantic (West Greenland) revealed a slight increase with overall annual rates of increase of 1.5%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 52.9% over three generation lengths (31.8 years) (see Supplementary Information figure 3). The shorter east Greenland survey (2008–2013) was not analysed but exhibits a similar stable trend.<br/><br/>Fourth, the trend analysis of the North Atlantic (Iceland) revealed a steady decline from the mid-1980s with annual rates of decrease of 1.7%, consistent with an estimated median decrease of 42.8% over three generation lengths (31.8 years) (see Supplementary Information figure 4).<br/><br/>Fifth, the trend analysis of the Northeast Atlantic (south) in the North Sea revealed a steady increase in abundance from 1980 until a peak in 1992, thereafter there has been a steady steep decline with annual rates of decrease of 2.2% consistent with an estimated median decrease of 83.2% over three generation lengths (31.8 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (see Supplementary Information figure 5).&#160;However, this decline should also be considered in relation to the longer time-series which indicated an increase in abundance from 1980 until a peak in 1992, with the current catch-per-unit-effort at similar levels to that observed at the start of the time-series. The recent elevated abundance in the 1980–1990s is more similar to the early 1900s, while between these periods Thorny Skate abundance was low (Sguotti <em>et al.</em> 2016). Whilst the reasons for this are uncertain, multispecies interactions and environmental conditions are potential factors affecting this region.<br/><br/>Sixth, the trend analysis of the Northeast Atlantic (north) in the Barents Sea and Norwegian coast revealed steady and rapid increase with annual rates of increase of 8.1%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 226% over three generation lengths (31.8 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (see Supplementary Information figure 6).<br/><br/>Overall, there is a strong latitudinal pattern in population trends, repeated on both sides of the Atlantic, with very steep declines (&gt;80% reduction in three generations) in the most southerly parts of this species' distribution (and Iceland) coupled with recovery and increasing abundance at more northerly latitudes. The overall weighted trend was calculated by weighting each time-series by an area–based estimate of the size of each region as a proportion of the species’ global distribution (EOO: extent of occurrence, see Supplementary Information Table 1). When these trends are taken together, there is a 42% probability that the species is threatened and a 54% probability that it is Least Concern. Overall, Thorny skate has undergone an estimated population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (31.8–48 years) due the combination of exploitation with habitat shifting and alteration due to climate change at lower latitudes while, further north, earlier levels of exploitation that have ceased or greatly decreased.

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–80 m. The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with a likely low post release survival rate. Inferred and suspected declines over the past three generation lengths (15 years) range from 23–89%, although across most of its range the declines are 23–39% and across most of that area, fishing pressure is high. Based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the Smallspot Numbfish&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Smallspot Numbfish is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–80 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 40 cm total length (TL), though is usually smaller at 35 cm TL; males mature at &lt;28 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and size-at-birth is ~13cm TL (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Smallspot Numbfish (75 vs 40 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is likely mostly discarded due to its small size that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal, but is possibly retained for local consumption and 'trash fish' in Malaysia (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). Post release survival is likely low, as <em>Narcine</em> species are soft bodied and easily damaged (de Carvalho <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Across China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020a). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020a). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, by the 1980s overfishing was apparent (Palomares <em>et al</em>.  2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ  significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400  vessels) and mostly use trawls,  longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares<em> et al.</em> 2014).  Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls  operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a  maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). Demersal stocks  captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with  some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s led to fully exploited inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <span lang=""EN-AU""><a name=""_Hlk46146531"">The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014</a>. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). It has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). Rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings in 2003, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Bangladesh has a large artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions.  In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018).  All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal  longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m  depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine</em> species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). These declines are concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). <br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk46923857"">In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020c).</a> There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em>2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005).","<p></p><p>There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. It is rare in Taiwan and Myanmar (Lin 2010, A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Peninsular Malaysia, west coast, reconstructed landings showed a 54% decline from a peak of 19,308 t in 1979 to  8,902 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Landings slowly  increased from the 1950s to the peak catch in 1979 then have been  fluctuating considerably since then. Fishing pressure has been  increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in  these populations in west coast, Peninsular Malaysia. In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid -1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Sri Lanka, reconstructed landings data showed a five-fold increase over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. Total catches have fluctuated greatly but continued to rise overall (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). A population trend cannot be inferred as effort has also increased during this period.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, it is difficult to separate this species from the Chinese Numbfish (<em>N. lingula</em>), and all specimens from Taiwan are currently provisionally identified as the Chinese Numbfish (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays in Taiwan has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In the Philippines, from 1976 to 2006, the landings of all combined ray  species from municipal and commercial fisheries decreased by 76% over 16  years from 1991 to 2006. The annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a  peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI  2017). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to  represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was  increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and  Pauly 2014). In Thailand, landings data are available on all combined  ray species from the EEZ for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings  data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose  steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a  steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is  difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>The population of the Smallspot Numbfish&#160;is suspected to have declined off India due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr&#160;in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Across India, landings of elasmobranchs have declined by 44% from 1998 to 2018, this is despite increasing effort which infers a decline in their populations (Gupta <em>et al. </em>2020).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Smallspot Numbfish&#160;(15 years), they represent declines of 23%, 84%, 76%, 28%, 89%, 36%, 66% and 30% in China, Viet Nam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Mumbai and across India, respectively. Trends cannot be determined for Sri Lanka and Myanmar, though declines of ray populations are suspected in recent years in Myanmar. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The declines range from 23–89%, although across most of its range the declines are 23–39%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Smallspot Numbfish. Overall, based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years).</p>  <p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Smallspot Numbfish&#160;is found from the South China Sea to the Bay of Bengal in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. It occurs from China to India, including Taiwan, Viet Nam (Gulf of Tonkin), the Philippines (Sibuyan and Visayan Seas), Thailand (Gulf of Thailand), Indonesia (Sumatra), Malaysia (Peninsular), Singapore, Myanmar, and Bangladesh (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","Based on cogeneric and sympatric<em> Narcine</em> species, the Smallspot Numbfish&#160;is likely not used for human consumption as there is very little meat on the animal (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). In Indonesia and Bangladesh, <em>Narcine</em> species are generally discarded at sea as fishers fear being electrocuted by them and they are low value in Indonesia and Myanamr (Fahmi, A. Haque and A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). In China and Taiwan, it is retained but discarded at the markets as it is unsuitable for fish meal in those countries; it may sometimes be consumed by fishers at sea in Taiwan (H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). In Malaysia, it is likely used for 'trash fish' (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020), that is, fish meal and other products.",Marine,"No specific conservation measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, large mesh gillnets (&gt;24.5 cm) were banned in 1990 (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries permits Danish seine (Cantrang) to operate but they are spatially restricted (Chong <em>et al.</em> 1987). In the Philippines, active fishing gears, including trawlers, were  prohibited in 1998 within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles  from shore). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since  2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries  Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020),  which may reduce the retention of rays (Brewer<em> et al. </em> 2006). In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik  Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited  (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a  nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the  nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large  numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little  knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm.  02/04/2020). Research is required to better define the population size  and trends, and life history of the Smallspot Numbfish,&#160;and catch  rates should be monitored.   <p></p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global
124509147,161571,Mustelus widodoi,Vulnerable,A2d,2021,2020-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whitefin Smooth-hound (<em>Mustelus widodoi</em>) is a small (to 120 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans off Indonesia and Malaysia (Sabah, Borneo). It is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 60–120 m. In Indonesia, this species is of low commercial value, and it is caught occasionally by demersal longliners off Bali, and possibly Lombok, but it possibly occurs deeper than the majority of fisheries. It is retained for local consumption of its meat and its fins are retained for trade. Reconstructed landings data of all carcharhinid sharks combined from the Central Indonesia indicate declines of 42% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) of the Whitefin Smoothhound. These catch trends are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the geographic distribution of this species, but there may be some refuge at depth. Overall, it is suspected that the Whitefin Smoothhound has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (33 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p></p>The Whitefin Smoothhound is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 60–120 m (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It reaches a maximum size of 110 cm total length (TL), males mature at 83 cm TL and females mature at 92 cm TL (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Reproduction is presumably lecithotrophic viviparous and size-at-birth is &lt; 31 cm TL (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Generation length is inferred from a similar-sized congener, the Starspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>), which has a female age-at-maturity of 3–7 years and maximum age is 17 years; generation length is therefore 11 years (Yamaguchi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000).","<p></p>The Whitefin Smoothhound is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for the meat and fins. In Indonesia, this species is of low commercial value, and it is caught occasionally by demersal longliners off Bali and possibly Lombok. It possibly occurs deeper than the majority of fisheries, though more information is required. Trawl fishing is particularly intensive in Indonesia, for example, in the nearby Arafura Sea region (W.T. White pers. comm. 28 June 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further to maintain catches (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by demersal trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Significant fishing activity also occurs off the southwest coast of Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean. Aceh Province in Sumatra is thought to be Indonesia’s largest shark fishing province, in terms of the total number of fisheries taking sharks (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Smoothhounds (Mustelus spp.) are occasionally recorded in fisheries on the southwestern coast of Aceh, which may be the Whitefin Smoothhound. Some specialized shark longlines operate in Aceh province, with demersal longliners potentially overlapping with Whitefin Smoothhound geographic range. Smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus </em>spp.) are also recorded in elasmobranch fisheries in Muncar (East Java), which operate in the Bali strait (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2019). Tuna longlines, specialised shark longlines and gillnets all operate in this fishery; <em>Mustelus </em>spp are likely caught in specialised shark longlines (H. Booth Wildlife Conservation Society unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.<br/><br/>In Sabah, Malaysia this species is caught in trawl fisheries in the South China Sea. The trawlers fishing out of Kota Kinabalu typically fish at 60–70 m depth and hence this species may have some refuge at depth (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Sabah, due to the high number of unlicensed local and migrant small-scale fishers, fisheries landings are underreported by an estimated 2.5 times (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). Similarly, the number of small-scale fishers may be three times higher than the reported number, thus exploitation levels are far higher than reported.<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull <em>et al</em>. 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).","This species is captured infrequently in Indonesia, but the true catch rates remain uncertain due to taxonomic uncertainty as catches are reported as Starspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>) and separately as <em>M. cf manazo</em>. There were moderate catches of 1–2 individuals of Starspotted Smoothhound per demersal-set longline trip in 2016 and 2019 and catches of 1–8 individuals of <em>M. cf manazo </em>per demersal-set longline trip in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2019 (H. Booth Wildlife Conservation Society unpubl. data 2020). These episodic and low levels of catch may indicate that any overlap of fisheries with depth range may require clarification as the Whitefin Smoothhound possibly occurs deeper than the majority of current fisheries.<br/><br/>Fishermen have reported decreased catches and smaller sizes of sharks in Indonesia. Decreases were reported in more recent years of commonly caught species (e.g. Whitetip Reef Shark (<em>Triaenodon obesus</em>), Snaggletooth Shark (<em>Hemipristis elongata</em>), and Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus melanopterus</em>)) and decreases starting 20 years ago in other species (e.g. hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.), wedgefishes (<em>Rhynchobatus</em> spp.), and Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>)) with no species having increased in abundance over the past two decades (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, reconstructed catch data shows catches of carcharhinids increased throughout the mid to late 1900s. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before it rapidly decreased ~325% in the mid 1990s to 11,500 t, where catch has since remained relatively stable (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s before reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000 and 17,500 t until 2004. After which, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600 and 14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone of the Eastern Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure ('actual levels of exploitation') is high across the geographic distribution of this species, but there may be some refuge at depth for this species. Declines in reconstructed catch of carcharhinids from Indonesia are consistent with a population reduction of 42% over three generation lengths (33 years). Overall, it is suspected that the Whitefin Smoothhound has undergone a reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (33 years) based on actual levels of fishing pressure, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",Decreasing,"The Whitefin Smoothhound occurs in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific off Indonesia and Malaysia (Sabah, Borneo) (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, this species occurs on the south coast of Sumatra, Java, and the Lesser Sunda islands in central Indonesia (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). There are records of Starspotted Smoothhound‘<em>Mustelus manazo</em>’ and ‘<em>Mustelus cf manazo</em>’ from Tanjung Luar, Lombok which could be Whitefin Smoothhound (Yulianto <em>et al</em>. 2018, H. Booth Wildlife Conservation Society unpubl. data 2020). Fisheries land catches at Tanjung Luar, Lombok from the Lesser Sunda Islands (around Flores, Sumba and Sumbawa) which suggests, if the identity is confirmed, this species may have a more eastward range (H. Booth Wildlife Conservation Society unpubl. data 2020).","This species is used for its meat and fins, with the fins likely internationally trade, as Mustelus spp. fins comprised 0.39 and 0.76% of fins sampled in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, respectively (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific measures in place. In 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was put in place and set to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas making up 239,428 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><p></p><p>  </p><p><strong>&#160;</strong></p>","",,false,false,Global
124514068,161607,Narke dipterygia,Vulnerable,A2d,2021,2020-11-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Spottail Sleeper Ray (<em>Narke dipterygia</em>) is a small (to 35 cm total length) ray found in the Indian, Western Central, and Northwest Pacific Oceans ranging from Oman to Japan. It is demersal on the continental shelf to a depth of at least 100 m. The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline and is mostly discarded due to its small size with a likely low post-release survival rate but is retained in some areas for fishmeal. There are no species-specific population trends, though landings data of all rays and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates combined from Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) across the species' range infer declines of 23–97% over the past three generation lengths (15 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. Fishing pressure is high across most of the range of the Spottail Sleeper Ray, yet the abundance of a regional congener, the Japanese Sleeper Ray, has changed little in Taiwan over the past 10–15 years suggesting these sleeper rays may have some resilience to fishing pressure. Trawl, inshore, and seasonal fishing bans in parts of its range may provide some refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Spottail Sleeper Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Spottail Sleeper Ray occurs on the continental shelf on sandy and muddy habitats from nearshore to at least 100 m depth (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 35 cm total length (TL), with Arabian Seas populations attaining this larger size and elsewhere more commonly to a maximum size of 20 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Males and females mature at 15 cm TL (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2007, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 4–6 pups and size-at-birth of ~10 cm TL (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2007). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown and lacking for all sleeper rays. Ages are inferred from the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Spottail Sleeper Ray (75 cm vs 35 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Spottail Sleeper Ray.","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. Electric rays are not targeted in any part of this species’ region and are often discarded at sea with low survivorship. In some areas, the species is retained as bycatch for fish meal production. Sleeper rays are caught as a minor component of the bycatch at least in Taiwan and Japan (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean region, the Spottail Sleeper Ray occurs in some areas of intense demersal trawl activity. No specific information is available on catches of the Spottail Sleeper Ray as species-specific data are not recorded, however, the high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). The Spottail Sleeper Ray is occasionally recorded at landing sites in India as trawl bycatch (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020), although most electric rays are discarded at sea. In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s led to fully exploited inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili et al. 2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally and the country has been among the top shark fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). The catch of rays is rising as shark fisheries collapse; in 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Dharmadi 2007).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). Since the 1980s, demersal trawls are the dominant gear followed by purse seines and small-scale gear (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao et al. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016). In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al</em>. 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara et al. 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 1 September 2019).<br/><br/>Dramatic levels of habitat loss in parts of its region may pose a threat. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).","There is limited species-specific population trend information for this species. In Oman, trawling was banned in 2011 and as this is the main gear that captures this species in that area, the population is suspected to have been stable for at least the past two generation lengths (10 years). In Pakistan, the use of demersal-set gillnets targeting rays has almost doubled in the last five years due to increasing demand for stingray wings in Thailand and Malaysia. Annual landings of rays was reported to be 42,000 t in 1979, 41,230 t in 1980, and 20,780 t in 1999 which reduced to 3,723 t in 2019; landings were mainly from targeted gillnet fisheries and bycatch of other fisheries, primarily trawls (M. Khan pers. comm. 18 August 2020). There has been a ~30% decrease in trawl catches of the Spottail Sleeper Ray over the past 15 years (three generation lengths) (M. Khan pers. comm. 12 December 2020).<br/><br/>The population is suspected to have declined off India due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This is approximately a 66% decline over a period of three generation lengths of the Spottail Sleeper Ray (15 years). Although this information is not species-specific, and electric rays are generally discarded at sea (with low survivorship), this provides an indication of overall batoid declines as a result of heavy and increasing fishing pressure on the continental shelf in India.<br/><br/>In Thailand, landings data are available on all combined ray species from the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. In Taiwan, a regional congener, the Japanese Sleeper Ray (<em>Narke japonica</em>) has changed little in abundance at landing sites over the past 10–15 years (see the <a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/161665/124524467"">Japanese Sleeper Ray</a> Red List assessment). Landings data on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan EEZ indicate an 80% decrease over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/8/2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, and these declines can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Malaysia, Cambodia, Viet Nam, China, South Korea, and Japan EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly et al. 2020). In west coast Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed landings showed a 54% decline from a peak of 19,308 t in 1979 to 8,902 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed landings showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite attempts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishing effort has increased during this period (Anticamara et al. 2011). In Japan, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings from 1950 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (15 years) of the Spottail Sleeper Ray they represent declines of 30%, 66%, 28%, 97%, 84%, 39%, 23%, 68% and 65% in Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and Japan, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Spottail Sleeper Ray, yet the abundance of a regional congener, the Japanese Sleeper Ray, has changed little in Taiwan over the past 10–15 years suggesting these sleeper rays may have some resilience to fishing pressure. Trawl, inshore, and seasonal fishing bans in Oman, Taiwan, and China may provide some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Spottail Sleeper Ray occurs in the Indian, Western Central, and Northwest Pacific Oceans from Oman to Japan including Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, China, Taiwan, and North and South Korea (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Sleeper rays in general, and also this species, are usually not used for human consumption as there is very little meat on the animals (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). In China and Taiwan, this species is retained and sometimes discarded at the markets and sometimes used for fish meal (J. Zhang and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28 August 2019). In Malaysia, and for small individuals in Cambodia, the species is used for 'trash fish' (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020), that is, for fish meal and other products. In Viet Nam, this species is likely used to produce fish meal and fish sauce (FAO 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. Oman has banned trawling in its waters since 2011. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi pers. comm. 6 May 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km2 and in Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km². Although these areas may provide some refuge to the inshore component of this species range (CTI 2020), most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits shallow coastal inshore and rocky habitats from the surface to 30 m. The species is taken as a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption. Reconstructed catch data of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone indicate a decline of 41% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) of the Burmese Bambooshark. Further, a population reduction of 31% was inferred for the Burmese Bambooshark based on a 50% decrease in fisheries-independent research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs (all species combined) between 1978–80 and 2013 in Myanmar. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of elasmobranchs in the region. This species occurs regularly in landings in West Bengal, however, it is an inshore species subject to intense fishing pressure across its range though it may have some possible refuge in rocky reef habitats. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of the Burmese Bambooshark. Alternatively, the increase in landings may imply some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Burmese Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (18 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","<p>The Burmese Bambooshark occurs in shallow inshore habitats including intertidal pools, rocky and coral reefs, and on soft sediments from the surface to depths of 30 m, with most of the distribution between 5–15 m (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). This species reaches a maximum size of 57.5 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is presumed to be oviparous. Bamboosharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Whitespotted Bambooshark (<em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 4.5 years and maximum age of 14, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Chen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). The Whitespotted Bambooshark is larger than the Burmese Bambooshark (95 cm vs 57.5 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 6 years for the Burmese Bambooshark.</p>","<p>The Burmese Bambooshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is regularly taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet and line, and retained for human consumption (SEAFDEC 2016, Psomadakis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>In India, this species is commonly found in landings in West Bengal (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In the Bay of Bengal, India has&#160;an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters throughout the region (&gt;23,000; K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across southeast Asia (Karnad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;There is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014).</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that has been increasing in recent decades with 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in 2017–2018 (DoF 2018, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The artisanal fishing fleet operates at depths of 0–40 m on average (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 t in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). The International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014. An indirect threat is the loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves. Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).</p><p></p>","<p>There is no species-specific trend information for the Burmese Bambooshark. Monitoring of fish landing sites in Southeast Asia revealed that the relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades due to declines in large sharks and increased targeting and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and&#160;Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Lack and Sant 2012, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In India, market surveys during 2009–2019 in West Bengal recorded a range of 8–52 individuals in a single day of landings (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Population declines are inferred from intensive trawling in shallow depth areas in the eastern Indian Ocean.&#160;</p><p>Despite the lack of species-specific trend data elsewhere, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;In Bangladesh, reconstructed landings data showed a 34% decline over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 then declined to 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent population declines, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This decline in landings is equivalent to a population reduction of 41% over the past three generation lengths (18 years) of the Burmese Bambooshark. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.</p><p>In Myanmar, estimates of shark and ray landings, from 1950 to the late 1990s, varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen revealed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs over the 33 years between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013 and a shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species (Krakstad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). This equates to a population reduction of 31% over the past three generations (18 years). Market surveys reveal a decline in landings 49% over a four-year period (2006–2010) despite no reduction in fishing effort and increasing domination by small short-lived species (San San Khine 2010).</p><p>Reconstructed catch data scaled to three generation lengths (18 years) from Bangladesh and scaled survey data from Myanmar, represent population reductions of 41% and 31%, respectively. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region and the Burmese Bambooshark may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks. It is occurring regularly in landings in West Bengal. However, it is an inshore species subject to intense fishing pressure across its range with some possible refuge in rocky reef habitats. Overall, it is suspected that the Burmese Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (18 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Burmese Bambooshark occurs in the Eastern Indian Ocean from India to Myanmar (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Haque&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019, K.K.

In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 02/04/2020).

It is an inshore species on the continental shelf to a depth of 60 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption and probably fish meal. It was considered common in Japan and China prior to the 2000s and landings data based on reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the Japan and China Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 92% and 46%, respectively over the past three generation lengths (36 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative  for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the  region. Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the Chinese range of the species, and it has possibly become extinct or at least severely depleted over the past one  generation length (12 years) in the northern part of its Chinese  distribution. Dramatic levels of habitat loss across the Chinese range are a threat to the species. The level of fisheries threat in Japan has significantly decreased and continuing to decline since  the early 2000s when this species was still considered common in  southern Japan, and it is possibly still common in southern Japan which accounts for a large part of its distribution. Overall, it is inferred that the Yantai Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three  generation lengths (36 years) due levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Yantai Stingray is demersal on soft-sediment habitats and occurs inshore on the continental shelf to depths of 60 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Juveniles are present in estuaries and coastal shallow waters in summer (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). It reaches a maximum size of 37 cm disc width (DW) (~76 cm total length; TL), males mature at 21.8 cm DW (42.9 cm TL) and females mature at~30 cm DW (~59 cm TL) (Furumitsu <em>et al. </em>2010, Last et <em>al. </em>2016b). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the related and similar-sized maskray complex (<em>Neotrygon </em>spp.) that have a verified female age-at-maturity of 6.5 years and a maximum age of 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010; as '<em>Neotrygon kuhlii</em>').","<p>The Yantai Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, and probably set net and gillnet, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal (Zhu and Meng 2001, Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Chinese range of the Yantai Stingray. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has  been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over  70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s  and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea,  more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly  and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>Inshore coastal fisheries resources across China have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear.<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China as one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). <br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk21698750"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s</a>–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg per capita in 2013 it is higher than that of neighbouring China (Helgil 2019).<a name=""_Hlk23247606""><br/><br/>In Japan, </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019).<br/><br/>Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the Chinese part of the distribution pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s and 65% loss of tidal flats (one type of intertidal habitat) since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al. </em>2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).</a></p>","The Yantai Stingray was noted as common in southern Japan and China in the early 2000s (Zhu and Meng 2001, Furumitsu <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Japan, the species has been confused with Red Stingray (<em><em>Hemitrygon</em> akajei</em>), making it difficult to assess population trends (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2016). In China, by the mid-2000s it was noted that it was infrequently observed and as it had been historically common in fish markets, a population decline was suspected (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2016). It has not been observed in recent genetic sampling of rays from fish markets in Chinese waters of the Yellow Sea and East China Sea (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019), which raises the possibility of local extinction or at least severe population decline.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Japan, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ.<br/><p><br/>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Yantai Stingray (36 years), they represent declines of 92% and 46% in Japan and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of batoids in the region.<br/><br/>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the Chinese spatial and depth range of the Yantai Stingray, and habitat loss in China is a threat to the species. It has possibly become extinct or at least been severely depleted over the past one generation length (12 years) in the northern part of its Chinese distribution, although if still present, seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. The level of fisheries threat in Japan has markedly decreased and continues to decline since the early 2000s when this species was still considered common in southern Japan. Overall, the species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).

Post-release survival is not known for any numbfish species. The trawl fisheries use small mesh sizes and have been intensive for a considerable time. Standardised catch rates of all rays have fluctuated greatly but remained fairly stable in southwest Taiwan over 17 years from 1997–2013. Landings of all skates combined across the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone have declined by 39% over the past three generation lengths (15 years). The Taiwanese Blind  Electric Ray has a restricted distribution that is intensively fished  across its entire spatial and depth range. This is of concern and with a  precautionary approach, it is suspected that the population has declined  rather than remained stable due to the high levels of intensive fishing  to which the species is exposed. It is inferred that the Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray  has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three  generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray is demersal on the upper continental slope at depths of 300–500 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 37.1 cm total length (TL); males mature at 16–22 cm TL and female first size-at-maturity is unknown but a 25.7 cm female TL was assumed to be mature (Carvalho <em>et al. </em>2003, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray (75 vs 37 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch by demersal trawl fisheries but discarded due to its small size and high water content in the flesh that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Post-release survival is unknown for numbfish (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). Fisheries on the Taiwan southwest coast are mainly shallow and coastal, but may range down to 700 m depth (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The deeper water trawl fishery targets multiple species of deep-water shrimp, uses small mesh sizes, and has been intensive for a considerable time (D. Ebert and H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). <br/> <br/> In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).</p>","In southwest Taiwan, an average of 10–20 Taiwanese Blind Electric Rays are observed in some trawls (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). There is no information on whether this level of catch has changed over time.<br/><br/>There is no species-specific catch data for this species. However, there is data from southwest Taiwan on the combined standardised catch rate of all ray species taken by bottom trawl. This catch rate fluctuated greatly but was fairly stable over 17 years from 1997 to 2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan Fisheries Institute unpubl. data 2019). Landings data are also available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort.<br/><br/>The landings of all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. When the level of decline is scaled to three generation lengths (15 years) of the Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray, it represents a 39% decline in abundance. This decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of population trends of skates in the area.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire range of the Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray. It is not abundant in trawls and there is no species-specific information on changes in abundance over time. Catches of all species of rays combined have been relatively stable over the past 17 years (slightly more than three generation lengths), yet there has been an overall decline of 39% in skates over three generation lengths (15 years). The Taiwanese Blind Electric Ray has a restricted distribution that is intensively fished across its entire spatial and depth range. This is of concern and with a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the population has declined rather than remained stable due to the high levels of intensive fishing to which the species is exposed.

The generation length is inferred from the two butterfly ray species with age parameters, the Backwater Butterfly Ray (<em>G. natalensis</em>) and Spiny Butterfly Ray (<em>G. altavela</em>) which have female ages-at-maturity of 6 years and 5 years and maximum ages of 24 years and 18 years, resulting in generation lengths of 15 years and 11.5 years, respectively (van der Elst 1988, Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2017). Thus, the generation length of the Japanese Butterfly Ray is inferred as 13 years. This should be used with caution as the two butterfly rays are much larger (250 cm DW and 260 cm DW) than the Japanese Butterfly Ray (145 cm DW).</p><p>  </p><p></p>","<p>The Japanese Butterfly Ray is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including demersal trawl, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption or fish meal in Taiwan and China, and discarded in Japan and possibly South Korea. At-vessel mortality of butterfly rays is 41–46% in trawl fisheries with post-release mortality unknown (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/></p><p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Japanese Butterfly Ray. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017).</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however, they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara<em> et al</em>. 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people moving into the industry (NFMT 2017,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019a).&#160;</p>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/></p><p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014). </p>  <p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Helgil 2019b). </p>  <p>  </p><p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. <a name=""_Hlk35497192"">In the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, intensive  coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to  widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since  the 1980s with 65% loss of tidal flats since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). </a>In the East China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands (Heileman and Tang 2009).<br/></p><p>  </p>","There are no species-specific population trend data for this species. It was previously reported as locally common with population declines in Japan and China (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Japan, set net catches of this species in Suruga Bay and trawl catches in Ariake Bay showed low but stable catches, that is, 100 individuals were captured over 40 years in Suruga Bay and from 1993 to 2007 the catch rates were stable (S. Tanaka and A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). It is infrequently captured in Taiwan and South Korea (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, C.-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019).  <p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">I</a>n Japan, the catch of all skates and rays combined from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara <em>et al. </em>2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). </p>  <p>In Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the EEZ. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. In southwest Taiwan, the combined standardised catch rate of all ray species taken by bottom trawl fluctuated greatly but was fairly stable over 17 years from 1997 to 2013 (H. Hsu Taiwan Fisheries Institute pers. comm. 28/08/2019). <br/></p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea and China EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (39 years), they represent declines of 78%, 73%, 95%, and 49% in&#160;Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China, respectively.

Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the spatial and depth range of the Japanese Butterfly Ray. Yet, the catches were stable in parts of Japan over 14 years, which indicates that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure.

Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people moving into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (<strong></strong>FAO 2019, Helgil 2019a).&#160;</p><p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>    <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).  </p><p><a name=""_Hlk22884618""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a></p>  <p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered  overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ,  and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued  to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo  and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s  EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late  1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200  vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H.  Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). In  Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish  consumption similar to the high levels in China (Helgil 2019b). </p>","This is one of the most abundant and common bycatch species of skate from the trawl fisheries in northeast and southwest Taiwan (Joung <em>et al. </em>2011, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, it was considered at the margin of optimal exploitation ten years ago in northeast Taiwan based on its life history and exploitation rate (Joung <em>et al. </em>2011). Elsewhere, there are no species-specific data on this species.<br/><br/>In Japan, the catch of skates and rays from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea, which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort, which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone.   <p></p><p>In Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the EEZ. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. An increase in ray landings from trawl catches in Da-Xi, northeast Taiwan from 1993 to 2006 (Lee 2008) is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019).<strong></strong></p>    <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the South Korea and China EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk24453985""></a></p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (31 years), they represent declines of 70%, 95%, 91%, and 41% in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Sharpspine Skate. Yet, the species is reported as common and abundant in Taiwan. This indicates that this skate likely has some resilience to fishing pressure, although it was considered at the optimal margin of exploitation ten years ago in northeast Taiwan. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may afford the species some refuge. Overall, the Sharpspine Skate is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). <br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Sharpspine Skate is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean from southern Japan to Taiwan, including North and South Korea, and China (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).",<p>This species is of low value in Taiwan where it is used for fishmeal (Joung <em>et al. </em>2011).

In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East China Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen </a><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">pers. comm. 28 August 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk24460796"">). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable, as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/></a></p>  <p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019).

Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019).

It has a limited depth range from the surface down to 20 m. With only two pups per litter, it is suspected to have limited biological productivity. This species is known from very few specimens and there are no  population trend estimates. Similar to other weasel sharks, this species may be targeted and taken as bycatch in artisanal and commercial inshore fisheries, and retained for human consumption. Despite considerable fisheries research surveys in the region and the distinctive markings of the species, it has rarely been recorded. Its limited South African range is within the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area (MPA), and although extremely rare, it is suspected that the South African portion of the range offers some refuge (although there is an urgent need to confirm its status there). In contrast, the extensive inshore artisanal fisheries elsewhere (e.g. Mozambique, Madagascar) are suspected to have driven a population reduction (particularly given the species' restricted depth range and low biological productivity). Balancing these contrasting situations, it is suspected that the Whitetip Weasel Shark&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Whitetip Weasel Shark is a slender shark that inhabits shallow coastal waters to a depth of 20 m (Weigmann 2016). The largest known specimen is 96 cm total length (TL) (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 2 pups (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). The small litter size infers this species may have limited biological productivity. Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown and there is no such data from a congener, but it is available from a member of the same family, the Snaggletooth Shark (<em>Hemipristis elongata</em>) that also occurs along the east African coastline with an age-at-maturity of 2.5 years and maximum age of 14.7 years (Last and Stevens 2009, Smart<em> et al.</em> 2013), resulting in a generation length of 8.6 years. However, the Snaggletooth Shark reaches a considerably larger size than the Whitetip Weasel Shark (240 cm vs 96 cm TL) and therefore the generation length of the Whitetip Weasel Shark is likely to be shorter in reality.","Similar to other weasel sharks, the Whitetip Weasel Shark  is possibly targeted and taken as bycatch in artisanal and small commercial inshore fisheries  within its range, and retained for human consumption (White<em> et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).  While the full extent of this species' distribution is currently  unknown, extensive artisanal fisheries operate in coastal waters of the  southwestern Indian Ocean (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Benkenstein 2013, da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015, Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015). Data are needed on the level of fisheries interactions with this species.","The Whitetip Weasel Shark is known from very few specimens and there are no population size or trend estimates. Although its previous abundance is unknown, the rarity of specimens of a species inhabiting shallow, coastal waters to 20 m depth is cause for concern, particularly with the presence of heavy fishing pressure over most of its range. It has been noted in the Gulf of Aden in recent years, Mozambique in 2007, South Africa in the 1980s, and Madagascar in the 1960s. This species may be overlooked in landings and recorded as other similar-looking shark species in commercial fisheries data. However, it is unlikely that this species would be misidentified in the extensive fisheries research surveys in the region during which this species was not found (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015, Le Manach and Pauly 2015), as it has distinctive fin markings (Compagno and Smale 1985). Reports indicate that shark resources in the Gulf of Aden, particularly off Yemen (including the Socotra Archipelago)  were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002). Overall, due to heavy fishing pressure  across much of its range and few records of its occurrence, along with potentially low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries, balanced with some potential refuge in South Africa, it is  suspected that this species has undergone  a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation  lengths (26 years).",Decreasing,"The Whitetip Weasel Shark occurs in the Western Indian Ocean; known specimens are from Kosi Bay, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Compagno and Smale 1985), Nosy Be and Nosy Iranja, Madagascar (Fourmanoir 1961 cited in Compagno and Smale 1985), central Mozambique (D. Ebert and E. Heemstra, unpubl. data based on photographs, 2007), and the Gulf of Aden (Yemen) (I. Elhassan, pers. comm., 4 July 2019). The occurrence of this species between Mozambique and Yemen is uncertain.","The utilization of the Whitetip Weasel Shark is not known, but similar to other weasel sharks, it is likely retained for subsistence use locally if taken in artisanal fisheries (e.g. White <em>et al. </em>2006).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this species. Recreational anglers in South Africa are restricted to one shark per species per day (maximum of 10 individuals per day) (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015), although enforcement is an ongoing issue. Its limited South African range is within the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area (MPA), and it possibly occurs in other reserves, such as South Africa's uThukela MPA to the south, and Mozambique's Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve to the north.

There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Spiny Skate. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017).

These fisheries operate to depths of ~1,800 m; the species accounts for 2–12.5% of the skate trawl catch and 62–97% of the skate longline catch (Nowara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Fisheries on the Kerguelen Plateau were effectively unregulated until 2003, and illegal fisheries were estimated to be three times more abundant than legal fisheries between 1997–2001 (Shust and Koslov 2006, Palomares and Pauly 2011). Management was introduced in 2003 and enforcement of the fisheries reduced&#160;Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated&#160;(IUU) fishing from&#160;thousands of tonnes to hundreds of tonnes (CCAMLR 2018). Skate catches prior to this enforcement were probably underestimated. There is still some evidence of IUU fishing of the edges of the Kerguelen–Heard Exclusive Economic Zone (Weimerskirch<em> et al.</em> 2020).&#160;Previous tagging studies have suggested post-release mortality of sub-Antarctic demersal trawl skates is high (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2008), however, recent risk assessments have indicated skates in the Heard and McDonald Islands fisheries were at low risk of unsustainable fishing (Dell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from standardized longline catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in Antarctica (Kerguelen Plateau and Heard and McDonald Islands) between 2006–2014 (Nowara <em>et al. </em>2017). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (42 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of decrease of 1.1% consistent with an estimated decline of&#160;37.4% over three generation lengths (42 years), with the highest probability of&#160;no population reduction over the three generation lengths. However, trend analysis also estimated a 28% probability of &gt;50% decline over three generation lengths.&#160;Due to estimated declines in the Kerguelen part of its range, high levels of exploitation across all its known distribution, and refuge in the shallow part of its depth range, a global population reduction of 30–49% was estimated over three generation lengths (42 years).

This shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines throughout much of its range. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. There is evidence of a population reduction including an increasing rarity of landings and anecdotal evidence from fishers. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is high and has led to declines in pelagic sharks, and smaller coastal sharks are increasingly targeted without management (or inadequate enforcement of regulations). Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches in other species, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted.&#160;Throughout its Central and South American range, the species is subjected to intense fishing pressure.

Although this species has a relativity high biological productivity, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California. Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, balanced with some areas of refuge, it is suspected that the Pacific Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark inhabits the continental shelf from the intertidal zone to 100 m (Amezcua-Linares 1996), and it may utilize mangroves as other sharpnose sharks tend to (Gallo <em>et al.</em> 2010). It reaches a maximum size of 154 cm total length (TL) but is more commonly observed at sizes &lt;120 cm TL (Franke and Acero 1991, Márquez-Farías<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005); females mature at 103 cm TL and males at 58–69 cm TL (Hildebrand 1946, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to litters of 2–5&#160;young that are 33–34 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is suspected to be similar to that of the congeneric Atlantic Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon terranovae</em>) in the Gulf of Mexico at about 5 years (Carlson and Baremore 2003, Loefer and Sedberry 2003).","The Pacific Sharpnose Shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California is high and has led to declines in various marine species including pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). There is a hake trawl fishery in the northeastern Gulf of California that likely captures this species<em></em>. Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Guatemala, this species is landed commonly with a peak in November that includes neonates (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Costa Rica and Colombia, shrimp trawl fisheries have declined to the point of being unprofitable, indicating overfishing. In a vulnerability analysis of elasmobranchs in the Costa Rica shrimp  trawl fishery, this species was determined to be highly vulnerable (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2018). These sharks are caught frequently on bottom longlines in Costa Rica. Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' South American  range, and there is little management in place. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks, have been degraded as a result of coastal development and shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/>Although this species is relatively productive and could probably withstand some fishing pressure, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability, and there is no refuge at depth. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California.","In the Gulf of California, this coastal shark was the second most important shark in artisanal landings between 1960 and 2014, with peaks of 3,000 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s and of over 2,000 t in the early 1990s. Since the mid-1990s landings have been between 1,000 and 2,000 t (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2017). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks in the 1960s, and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records from the northern Gulf of California hake fishery are rare. This shark is subjected to intense fishing pressure in Guatemala, and a population reduction is suspected there. In Costa Rica, recent landings surveys have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that the species was previously much more common.&#160;In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s (P.A.

Furthermore, mangroves in the region have declined (López-Angarita<em> et al.</em> 2016). Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, its lack of refuge from fishing at depth, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Sharpnose Shark occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from southern California, USA to Peru (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","This shark is targeted and/or caught as retained bycatch through most of its range.

It is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 110–320 m. The first estimates of age lead to a very short generation length of 2.7 years, which should be treated with caution, as it is extremely short compared to most other small sharks. The species is a bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries that operate across its entire depth range, use small mesh sizes, and have been intensive for a considerable time. Standardised catch rates of all sharks taken by trawl in southwest Taiwan have declined by 64% over 17 years from 1997–2013. This represents a 41% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (8 years).  The species has a highly restricted  distribution, with a relatively narrow depth range entirely exposed to intense trawl  fishing. The inshore trawl ban in Taiwan  waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is inferred that the Taiwan Saddled Carpetshark has undergone a population reduction of  30–49% over the last three generation lengths (8 years) due to levels of exploitation (bycatch), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Taiwan Saddled Carpetshark is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 110–320 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 43 cm total length; males mature at 30.5 cm TL and females mature at 34.1 cm TL (Huang 2017). Reproduction is oviparous with size-at-birth is 11 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, Huang 2017). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 2.4 years and maximum age is estimated at 3 years; generation length is therefore estimated at 2.7 years (Huang 2017). The estimated growth rate is very rapid with a von Bertalanffy rate of<em> k</em>=0.520 for females (Huang 2017). These first age and growth estimates for this species should be treated with caution; they are not validated, carpetsharks are difficult to age, and the age parameters seem very low compared to sharks in general (Carrier <em>et al. </em>2010). The only other carpetshark age information is for a larger species, the Whitespotted Bamboo Shark (<em>Chiloscyllium plagiosum</em>) (95 cm vs 43 cm TL) that had an age-at-maturity of 4.5 years and maximum age of 12.6 years, and thus a generation length of 8.6 years (Chen <em>et al. </em>2007).","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch by demersal trawl fisheries but discarded due to its small size and thick skin that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Fisheries on the Taiwan southwest coast are mainly shallow and coastal, but may range down to 700 m depth (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The deeper water trawl fishery targets multiple species of deep-water shrimp, uses small mesh sizes that would likely capture juveniles and adults, and has been intensive for a considerable time (D. Ebert and H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Juveniles are still seasonally observed, despite the intense and ongoing fishing pressure (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Post release survival is unknown, but is high for other carpetsharks  taken by gillnet and trawl (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017, C. Rigby unpubl. data  2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).","The Taiwan Saddled Carpetshark is infrequently but regularly observed in southwest Taiwan with little observed change to the abundance in landing rates over the past 10 years, however this is based on low numbers that make changes difficult to ascertain (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). There is no specific information on effort in southwest Taiwan but industrial fishing effort has been slowly declining across the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone since the 1980s (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Despite the slow decline, fishing pressure remains high in Taiwan and is considered intense in southwest Taiwan (D. Ebert and H. Ho unpubl. data 2019).<br/> <br/> In southwest Taiwan, the combined standardised catch rate of all shark species taken by bottom trawls has fluctuated with an overall decline of 64% over 17 years from 1997 to 2013. The catch-per-unit-effort was ~28 kg/hour in 1997 and declined to ~10 kg/hour in 2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan Fisheries Institute unpubl. data 2019). When the level of decline is scaled to three generation lengths (8 years) it represents a 41% decline in abundance of sharks in southwest Taiwan. This decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the area.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire range of the Taiwan Saddled Carpetshark and there has been an overall decline of 41% in shark catch rates in the area over three generation lengths (8 years).

Overall, due to its  exposure to inadequately managed fisheries throughout its range, apparent reductions in some areas but stable landings elsewhere, it is suspected that the Cortez Numbfish&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (31.5 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Cortez Numbfish is a benthic electric ray that inhabits continental and insular shelves and estuaries from inshore to 100 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It is associated primarily with sandy substrates (including carbonate sands) (Breder 1928, Valadez-González <em>et al. </em>2000). It reaches a maximum size of 93 cm TL; females mature at 65 cm TL (at six years of age) and males at 43 cm TL (at four years of age) (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth after 10–12 months to up to 15 pups that are born at 11 cm TL (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species sexually segregates, with females much more common in  shallow embayments than males, especially during late spring and early  summer (Bizzarro 2005). Maximum age is 11 years for males and 15 years for females (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000), and generation length is estimated to be 10.5 years.","The Cortez Numbfish is captured in industrial demersal trawl fisheries, trammel nets, and in artisanal gillnets. In the Gulf of California, gillnets are prevalent, lack management, and  have been noted to have caused declines in teleosts, pelagic sharks, and rays (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Artisanal gillnet  fisheries are intense and increasing and lack management further south.  This species has been shown to have a moderate to high susceptibility to  capture in trawl fisheries (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2018). Shrimp  trawling is widespread in the southern Gulf of California. Trawling is  intense off Mazatlan, and this fishery is noted for its overcapacity,  poor governance and declining catches (Foster and Vincent 2010).","In the Gulf of California artisanal fishery, landings of Cortez Numbfish between 1997 and 2014 declined before returning to levels similar to the start of the time-series (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, this species was caught in low numbers in research trawls in 2011. In Guatemala between 1996 and 1998, this electric ray represented 15% of batoid bycatch in the industrial shrimp trawl fishery, and in 2006 it only represented 3.6% (Ixquiac-Cabrera <em>et al. </em>2010), equivalent to a &gt;85% population reduction over three generations (31.5 years). In Costa Rica from 2008 to 2012, this species was captured in 100% of trawls in one study (Clarke<em> et al. </em>2016).&#160;Data the industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 2001 and 2007 showed increase in the relative abundance of Cortez Numbfish (0.14 individuals/hour to 0.86 ind/hr) but a decrease in the average size (58 cm total length (TL) to 37.8 cm TL; Navia and Mejía-Falla 2016). Overall, due to its exposure to inadequately managed fisheries throughout its range, reductions in catches in some areas despite increased effort, and its continued presence in other areas, it is suspected that the Cortez Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (31.5 years).",Decreasing,"The Cortez Numbfish occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Baja California Sur, Mexico to northern Peru, including the Gulf of California and the Revillagigedo Islands (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","This species is utilized for local consumption in Mexico.

It is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 20–60 m, possibly to a depth of 136 m. The species is a bycatch of demersal trawl, gillnet,&#160;and set net fisheries, and is retained for human consumption.<br/><br/>Prevoiusly this species was considered common, though no species-specific population trend data are available. Catches of skates and rays from the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone indicate declines of 56–70% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Historic fishing pressure was high across the species’ entire range, and although fishing pressure has declined over the past 30 years, this species' restricted spatial and depth range mean it is highly exposed with little refuge from intense fisheries. Regional congeners have been reported as common in some areas and to have high biological productivity, which would provide some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Browneye Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","<p>The Browneye Skate is demersal on sand and mud habitats of the inner continental shelf at depths of 20–60 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016), and possibly to a depth of 136 m (Kawano and Kobayashi 2010). It reaches a maximum size of 52 cm total length (TL), males and females mature at~44 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Two congeners of similar size and depth ranges, the Spiny Skate (<em>O. kenojei</em>) and the Sharpspine Skate (<em>O. acutispina</em>) have female ages-at-maturity of 3.4 and 7.2 years and maximum ages of 10.5 and 13.2 years (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2002, Joung <em>et al. </em>2011), resulting in generation lengths of 6.9 and 10.2 years, respectively. It is thus inferred that the generation length of the Browneye Skate is on the lower side of 7–10 years.</p>","The Browneye Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its entire limited spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl, gillnet, and set net fisheries, and retained for human consumption (Ishihara<em> et al. </em>2009).   In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however, they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019).","The Browneye Skate was previously reported as common (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2009), though there are no species-specific trend data prior or post 2009. In the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the catch of skates and rays from 1955 to 1995 showed a decline of 79% from a peak catch of 18,782 t in 1955 to 3,985 t in 1995 (Ishihara<em> et al. </em>2002). This decline is mainly attributed to a decrease in catches in the East China Sea which consisted mostly of small <em>Okamejei</em> species (not identified to species level). Catches of skates and rays in the East China Sea declined by 77% from 1955 to 1986 (Ishihara<em> et al.</em> 2002). Although this species does not occur in the East China Sea, the decline in <em>Okamejei</em> species is indicative of the possible decline in the Browneye Skate over the long-term. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of rays and skates in the Japan EEZ.   <br/><br/>  When the decline in skates and rays across the Japan EEZ is scaled to three generation lengths of the Browneye Skate (21 years), it represents a decline of 56–70%. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) was high across the entire restricted spatial and depth range of the Browneye Skate, although fishing pressure has declined in Japan over the past 30 years. Regional congeners of similar size have been reported as common in some areas and to have high biological productivity, which would provide some resilience to fishing pressure (see Red List assessments of Spiny Skate (<em>O. kenojei</em>) and the Sharpspine Skate (<em>O. acutispina</em>)). Although fishing pressure has declined, the limited spatial and depth range is of concern and the species is still fished. The Browneye is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (21 years).",Decreasing,"The Browneye Skate is endemic to southern Japan in the Northwest Pacific Ocean (Nakabo 2013, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).",The species is eaten as dried skate 'wings' and processed into fishcakes in Japan (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2009).,Marine,"No specific measures are in place.

The Graceful Catshark is subject to intense fishing pressure across its range. The species is likely taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears including trawl, seine net, gillnet, and torchlight net. The species is considered common in Taiwan where the population is inferred to have remained stable for the past 15 years and the abundance in one part of China is inferred to have also remained stable over the past 20 years. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 34–96% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative  for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Declines of this species are inferred in Indonesia due to high levels of fishing pressure and declines in many elasmobranch species in the region. Stable population abundance in Taiwan and in one  part of China over the past 15 and 20 years, respectively, indicate some resilience to fishing pressure. Seasonal  fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan, respectively, would provide the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is  inferred that the Graceful Catshark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (45 years) due to high levels of exploitation and inferred population stability in some parts of its range, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Graceful Catshark is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 50–320 m (Weigmann 2016). The species reaches a maximum size of 65 cm total length; males mature at 42 cm TL and females at 51 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Reproduction is oviparous with egg cases laid in pairs (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Nothing else is known of its biology. There are no age estimates from the family Proscylliidae and related families (i.e., catsharks of the families Scyliorhinidae and Pentanchidae) are difficult to age. The most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) (family Pentanchidae) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al. </em>2011). This should be treated with caution and as an estimate only as the two species are in different families.","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net, gillnet, and torch light net. Trawls operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. In Taiwan and Japan, and possibly China and Korea, it is retained for fish meal production for aquaculture.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Graceful Catshark. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and  intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in  fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang  2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish  that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to  produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28 August 2019).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>I</a>n China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019a, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Although there is no detailed effort data, the number of trawl vessels operating in the northeast of Taiwan has remained fairly stable from 1999 to 2008 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort across Taiwan has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239  from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984  from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl.  data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types,  accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries  catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%)  (Fisheries Agency 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Antimacara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Antimacara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019). <br/><br/>In Indonesia, fishing pressure is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is likely the Graceful Catshark is captured with a range of gears across its depth range where it occurs in Indonesia. <br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat   destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman   and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p></p>","<p>This species is considered common in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b), with little change in the observed landing rates over the past 31 years in the northeast of Taiwan where fishing pressure has remained relatively stable (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019).   In China, the species is not abundant with little change in abundance  in one area over the last 20 years, inferred from the same amounts being  taken to a shark processing factory over that period (J. Zhang unpubl.  data 2019).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953 to </a><a name=""_Hlk22720982""></a>2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Antimacara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al. </em>2013). <br/><br/>Additionally, in Southeast Asia, catches of sharks are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Graceful Catshark in Indonesia are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki<em>&#160;et al. </em>2006).</a><br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (45 years) they represent declines of 34%, 92%, 45%, 93%, and 96% in Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of the Graceful Catshark, although the landing rates in Taiwan have remained stable over the last 15 years and the population is inferred to be stable over the past 20 years in one part of China. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (45 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Graceful Catshark is endemic to Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. In the Northwest Pacific, it is found from Japan to Viet Nam, including South and North Korea, China, and Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In the Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian, it occurs in Indonesia off northwest Java and southeast Sumatra (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a).","The species is likely too small for human consumption. The meat is low value and is used for fish meal in Taiwan and China (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019, J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008).&#160;The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). <br/><br/>There are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, there are ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, some management measures to regulate shark fishing, such as catch quotas, are being implemented. However, compliance and further management to improve sustainability are needed (Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Research is required to better define the life history, population size and trend of the Graceful Catshark, and catch rates should be monitored.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 20–175 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is likely retained for human consumption and fish meal. Landings data of all skates combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 41–93% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the species’ entire range, yet it appears to have a fairly stable population in northeast Taiwan over the past 31 years which indicates that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. Dramatic levels of habitat loss across its China and South Korea ranges are also likely a threat to the species. It is inferred that Boeseman's Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (31years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.</p>","Boeseman's Skate is demersal on soft-sediment habitats of the continental shelf at depths of 20–175 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~55 cm total length; male and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is oviparous and it is known to breed from January to April in the East China Sea (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 1995). Ages are inferred from the similar-sized Sharpspine Skate (<em>Okamejei acutispina</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 7.2 years and a maximum age of 13.2 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.2 years (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2011).","<p>Boeseman's Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears likely including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption or fish meal.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of Boeseman's Skate. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22884618"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s, the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011).</a> The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). <a name=""_Hlk29906024"">Although there is no detailed effort data, the number of trawl vessels operating in the northeast of Taiwan has remained fairly stable from 1999 to 2008 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). </a>The  artisanal fishing effort across Taiwan has steadily and markedly declined for  non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for  fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004)  (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In  Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish  consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014,  Helgil 2019a).<br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s and 65% loss of tidal flats (one type of intertidal habitat) since the 1950s (Murray <em style="""">et al. </em>2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).</a></p>","Boeseman's Skate is uncommon in Taiwan, however there has been little change in the observed landing rates over the past 31 years in the northeast of Taiwan where fishing pressure has remained relatively stable (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, in Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. <br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</a><br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of Boeseman's Skate (31 years), they represent declines of 64%, 89%, 41%, 81%, and 93% in Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.<br/><br/>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across the entire spatial and depth range of Boeseman's Skate. Yet, a stable population is inferred in the northeast Taiwan where high fishing pressure has remained fairly stable. This suggests the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may afford the species some refuge. Overall, the species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (31 years).",Decreasing,"Boeseman's Skate is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific from southern Japan to central Viet Nam, including South Korea, China, and Taiwan (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).",<p>No information is available on use and trade; if retained it is likely used for human consumption or fish meal (D.

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). </a><br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>This species may be protected in parts of China where there are approximately  124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces,  although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019).  Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019a) and five  marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the  World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All  protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook  2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).

It is a primarily inshore species; the maximum depth is unknown but it is probably less than 50 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is likely retained for human consumption and fish meal. This is a poorly-known stingray with no species-specific information other than it was known to be commonly captured in China.

Historic and current fishing pressure are high across the species’ range. Overall, China accounts for more than half of its distribution and based on previous reports that it was commonly captured in China and the inferred reductions in China, it is suspected that the Blackfish Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Blackfish Stingray is demersal on the continental shelf. It is a primarily inshore species and probably at depths of 0–50 m, although no specific information is available on its maximum depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). It reaches a maximum size of at least 38 cm disc width (DW), a male was mature at 32 cm DW, but male and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b, Weigmann 2016). Ages are inferred from the related Kuhl's Maskray (<em>Neotrygon kuhlii</em>) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 6.5 years and a maximum age of 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","<p>The Blackfish Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, likely including trawl, set net, and gillnet, and likely retained for human consumption or fish meal. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Blackfish Stingray.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, this species was reported in 2000 as commonly captured as bycatch in demersal trawls (Wang <em>et al. </em>2016). Inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, Pauly et al. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, FAO 2020). <br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore and occur across all habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, and estuaries. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture,&#160;which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995). </a></p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series for the Blackfish Stingray. This was one of three most commonly marketed stingrays in China (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2016), although there is no recent information on landings. Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for China, Viet Nam, and Cambodia  Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), based on landings data (Zeller and   Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of   abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where   landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or   increased. </p><p>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).

Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, the reconstructed catch data showed a 91% reduction decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches sharply rose from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014  (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Blackfish Stingray (36 years), they represent declines of 46%, 98%, and 99% in China, Viet Nam, and Cambodia respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks and batoids in the region. This is a poorly-known stingray with no species-specific information, other than it was known to be commonly captured in China. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the spatial range of the Blackfish Stingray. The seasonal trawl bans in China may afford the species some refuge. Overall, China accounts for at more than half of its distribution and based on reports it was commonly captured in China within the past two generation lengths and on the inferred reductions in China, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Blackfish Stingray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Shanghai, China to Cambodia, including Viet Nam (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b).

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East and South China Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). </a><br/><br/>The species may be protected in parts of China where there are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km2, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b).

It is demersal on soft sediment habitats on the continental shelf from the surface to a depth of 20 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal trawl and gillnet. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with a likely low post-release survival rate but may occasionally be retained for human consumption and the production of fish meal. Suspected declines range from 20–89% over the past 10 years (the three generation length span is 6 years) and although they are not species-specific they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Finless Sleeper Ray, however it is very small and likely has a very short generation length which would provide some resilience to fishing pressure. It is suspected that Finless Sleeper Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past 10 years due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Finless Sleeper Ray is demersal on soft sediments on the inner continental shelf at depths of 0–20 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 15 cm total length (TL) (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Males mature at 8–10 cm TL and females mature at 11–12 cm TL (Compagno 1999).&#160;Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous, with one pregant female with four embryos (Compagno 1999, Last et al. 2016), but little else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Finless Sleeper Ray&#160;(93 cm vs 15 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as two years. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","This species is caught as bycatch of inshore demersal trawl and gillnets and mostly discarded but sometimes retained for fishmeal and retained in Cambodia for local consumption. Batoids are heavily exploited in the Andaman Sea, where intensive trawl fisheries operate on the western coast of Thailand (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2005). Probably not all bycatch of this species is landed, but survival of discards will presumably be very poor. Landed frequently as utilized bycatch in the Phuket market from Myanmar trawl fisheries, although rare in western research and museum collections. Although no specific data are available on the capture of this species, intensive trawl fisheries operate throughout its known geographic range.<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017). By 2007, over 40% of the trawler catch in the Gulf of Thailand consisted of small, low-value fish (Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>There is intense fishing pressure on its coastal and shelf habitats in Viet Nam. This species is likely taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include demersal trawl and gillnet and may be retained for fish meal production (FAO 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020). This species’ inshore coastal habitat means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><span lang=""EN-US"">","There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. Electric ray species appear to be generally less common now than previously off Thailand (C. Vidthyanon pers. obs. 28 June 2007) and the species has not been seen recently in Cambodia (L. Seyha unpubl. data 2020). Catches of combined sharks, rays, and skates have been reconstructed for the Gulf of Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Malaysia Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Thailand, the reconstructed catch data showed a 74% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches fluctuated from 1950 to 1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. In Cambodia, the reconstructed catch data showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches sharply rose from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>While not a whipray, the Finless Sleeper Ray is in a similar depth range and susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of electric rays. In Peninsular Malaysia, west coast, reconstructed landings of whiprays showed a 54% decline from a peak of 19,308 t in 1979 to 8,902 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to the peak catch in 1979 then have been fluctuating considerably since then. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in west coast, Peninsular Malaysia. Overall, in Malaysia, whipray populations are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years.<br/><br/>When these suspected declines are scaled to a 10-year span (because the three generation lengths would be 6 years for this species) of the Finless Sleeper Ray, they represent reductions of 52%, 89%, and 20%, in Cambodia, Viet Nam, and peninsular Malaysia, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Finless Sleeper Ray, although the species is very small with a likely short generation length which would provide some resilience to fishing pressure.

Fishery management, including National Shark Plans, and trawl fishery exclusion zones could contribute towards the conservation of this and other benthic species. In Viet Nam there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² in which this species may occur (CTI 2020). However, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to a depthof 60 m. Rays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Broad Cowtail Ray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across most of the species’ range. There are no species-specific time series, although&#160; reconstructed landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). It does have refuge in Australia, where it remains abundant. It is suspected that the Broad Cowtail Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>","The Broad Cowtail Stingray occurs in inshore waters to a depth of 60 m, although it prefers shallow waters (including estuarine waters and sometimes into freshwater) and is often located in intertidal lagoons, reef flats, and reef faces (Michael 1993, Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm disc width (DW), male and female size-at-maturity is unknown. Reproduction is&#160;viviparous with a litter size of two pups and size-at-birth is ~18 cm DW (Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al. </em>2016b). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length is inferred from a similar species, the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) which has a generation length of 20 years (Jacobsen 2007). The Blackspotted Whipray is smaller than the Broad Cowtail Ray (80 cm vs 200 cm DW ) and thus as a conservative estimation, the generation length is inferred as 25 years for the Broad Cowtail Ray.","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Broad Cowtail Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Australia, the species is a discarded bycatch in demersal prawn trawl fisheries. The mandatory use of turtle exclusions devices (TEDs) in prawn trawl fisheries operating off northern Australia should limit the catch of this species in these fisheries. In Papua New Guinea, this species is caught in low numbers in the Gulf of Papua Trawl, representing 0.1% of the total catch. All bycatch are sold and consumed locally with 81% reported dead upon gear retrieval (White <em>et al.</em> 2019). Catchability may be low in small-scale fisheries close to the coast where fishers use gillnets. There is an increasing trend of fishers in Western Province to access reef habitat in northern Torres Strait, hence susceptibility to small-scale fisheries may increase in the future (M.I. Grant pers. comm. 13/10/2020).</p><p>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).<span class=""tlid-translation""> The Broad Cowtail Ray is one of the most commonly landed rays in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/02/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</span></p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>In the Philippines, the Broad Cowtail Ray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3GT vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al. </em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p><a>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. In coastal waters, prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</span></p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t per year from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).<span class=""tlid-translation""></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juvenile rays are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length).&#160; There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;</span></span></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""></span></p><p>In the Arabian Seas region, cowtail rays are generally discarded in the Red Sea and the Gulf (due to undesirable meat), while they are retained in India. Fishers will often remove the tail before release. Rays without tails seem to survive as these have been recorded on Baited Remote Underwater Videos (BRUVs) in the region (J. Spaet pers. comm. 07/02/2017). Survivorship from released line catches would be higher than trawl where the species may suffer mortality even if released.</p><p>In the Western Indian Ocean, marine fisheries catches reported to FAO have increased <a>over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999 s</a>uggesting stocks are fully fished. There is concern for serial depletion with the number of species landed near-doubling from only 85 in 1971 to 152 reported in 2000 (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;More than 60 million people reside within 100 km of the coast of the Western Indian Ocean and there is great dependence on marine resources for food and employment (van der Elst <em>et al.</em> 2005). Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa and Madagascar (van der Elst<em> et al.</em> 2005). In contrast to many other regions of the world, where industrial fisheries with high-technical gear predominate, fishers in the Western Indian Ocean operate primarily at the subsistence and artisanal level. For example, in Tanzania, no more than 5% of fishers are active in industrial fishing, the other 95% being artisanal (van der Elst <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;Artisanal catches are underreported and most small-scale,artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or overexploited, especially where they are found close to population centres. <a>Over the last ten years,</a>&#160;the number of underexploited fisheries in the coastal zone has tended to decline and such fisheries are now an exception (FAO 2006, Pierce <em>et al. </em>2008).</p><p>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for estuarine and inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <br/></p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species. In Australia, the Broad Cowtail Stingray is considered common in inshore areas (Last and Stevens 2009). In Papua New Guinea, FAO records of shark harvests in the country are likely underestimates (Vieira <em>et al. </em>2017). Shark fishing activities have dramatically increased in recent decades and artisanal shark fishing is largely unmanaged (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014, Vieira <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Demersal longlines are used in artisanal fisheries with hooks ranging from 5 to 40 per line in Milne Bay and north coast, elsewhere gillnets are dominant (Vieira <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2020. M.I. Grant unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Elasmobranch catch in the country has steadily increased from the late 1960s to now (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Thus, the potential level of exploitation for this species is high throughout the country.</p><p>Despite the lack of species-specific trend data,  reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t per year in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Broad Cowtail Ray (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 93–99%.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (less than one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Broad Cowtail Rays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006. There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160; <br/></p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978-80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires (n=200) completed by local fishers have indicated a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque, unpubl. data, 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2-5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara<em> et al.</em> 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “<em>it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion</em>” and many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>This species is very&#160;rarely seen in the Gulf of Oman and has not been documented in landing surveys from Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). However, it was recently caught in research trawls surveys off the Gulf coast of the UAE (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In Iranian waters, the species has shown sharp declines in trawl catches since 2010, but these have not been quantified (F. Owfi pers. comm. 07/02/2017). In Oman, this was one of the most commonly captured batoid species in research trawls in 2007–2008 (McCoy <em>et al.</em> 2009) but was not common in landing surveys (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2004). In Pakistan, the species is caught in gillnet and trawl fisheries and has recently shown signs of declines of at least 30% (M. Khan pers. comm. 07/02/2017).&#160;Although this species appears in landings in both Pakistan and India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing.&#160;The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg per hr to 0.24 kg per hour in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Trawl fisheries have expanded rapidly since then (Akhilesh K.V. pers. comm. 07/02/2017).</p><p>Targeted and unmanaged fisheries for whiprays in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar, are likely to be leading to population reduction. Surveys of fishers in Zanzibar show that most considered shark and ray numbers in general to have decreased on their fishing grounds, concomitant with an increase in the sale value of meat (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). An ecological risk assessment identified whiptail stingrays as susceptible to southwest Indian Ocean small-scale fisheries and this species is the main catch in Kenyan elasmobranch fisheries (A. Temple pers. comm. 28/07/2018).</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across most of the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Broad Cowtail Ray. Overall, it is inferred that the Broad Cowtail Ray has undergone a 30–49% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (75 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.</p>",Decreasing,The Broad Cowtail Ray is widespread in the Indo-Pacific in the Eastern and Western Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Madagascar to New Caledonia and to the Philippines (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b).,"<p>The meat is used for human consumption. Throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range, the meat is consumed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. In Papua New Guinea, the meat is sold for local consumption (M.I. Grant pers. comm. 13/10/2020). In Indonesia and Malaysia, the meat is considered good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is occasionally landed at the markets in Singapore and sold to local grocery stores (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). <br/></p><p>Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand of ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and some anecdotal information suggests in restaurants as well (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p>In the Gulf of Oman this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption.&#160;In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan pers. comm. 28/04/2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh&#160;unpubl. data 2017). The skin of large rays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In India, ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price.",Marine,"<p>No species-specific measures are in place. In Australia,Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) are mandatory in the Northern Prawn Trawl fishery, and TEDs have successfully reduced the bycatch of this species by 97% in the fishery (Griffiths <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;Rays are now prohibited from being retained in northern Australian prawn trawl fisheries. The Broad Cowtail Ray is also afforded protection in the no fishing zones of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Recreational fishers have a possession limit of one stingray in Queensland (Queensland Government 2020).</p><p>In Papua New Guinea, some seasonal closures are in place for the Gulf of Papua prawn  trawl fishery (White <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles (nm) from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010 (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 MPAs (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 28/04/2020).</p><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with regulations specifically banning catches of rays. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history,  and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.<br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

The large-scale, targeted fishing pressure that led to overfishing of the North Atlantic stock has decreased markedly, although incidental catch in multi-species fisheries continues. Retention bans have been implemented in the European Union. In the Northeast Atlantic, considerable stock recovery has been achieved through long-term, science-based catch limits. In the South Pacific, New Zealand has a long history of managing Spiny Dogfish fisheries through quotas. Elsewhere, management measures are lacking. Given the history of Spiny Dogfish depletion that has taken decades of management to address, as well as the species’ inherent susceptibility to incidental capture and overfishing, precautionary, stringent management is advised for all stocks. Globally, the population of Spiny Dogfish is estimated to have reduced by 30–49%&#160;over the last three generations (51 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","<p>The Spiny Dogfish is found inshore in enclosed and open bays and estuaries, as well as offshore along the continental and insular slopes from the surface to 1,978 m, with most records occurring at depths &lt;600 m (Serena <em>et al. </em>2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum length of 200 cm total length (TL), although maximum size is highly variable across regions and most individuals are &lt;100 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). Maturity is also regionally variable; males mature between 52–100 cm TL and females mature 66–120 cm TL (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;2</em>013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, litter size is 1–32 pups, gestation is 12–24 months, and size-at-birth is between 18–33 cm TL (Ford, 1921, Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Using estimates from the Northwest Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 9.1 years and maximum age is 24 years (Bubley<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013), therefore generation length is 17&#160;years.</p>","<p>The Spiny Dogfish is taken as targeted and incidental catch by hand line, demersal gillnet, trawl, dredge, and longline in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries. While targeted fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean has declined markedly, the species is still susceptible to capture as bycatch in multi-species fisheries (Rago and Sosebee 2014, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, ICES-WGEF 2018, FNZ 2019). Aggregative behaviour increases the catchability of mature (and usually pregnant) females (ICES-WGEF 2018). In European Union (EU) industrial fisheries, the species is generally discarded due to bans on retention, transshipment, and landing (e.g. ICES-WGEF 2018). Post-release mortality varies depending on handling techniques and gear type (e.g up to ~30% in trawl fisheries); at vessel mortality has been estimated as high as ~39% for gillnet fisheries (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Historically, the species has been intensively fished off Europe since the early 1900s (mainly in the North and Irish Seas), primarily by British and Norwegian fleets, and later by French and Irish fleets (Bonfil 1994). As of 2010, science-based regulations ended EU industrial fisheries targeting Spiny Dogfish in the Northeast Atlantic; landings are still reported from Norway (between 216–313 t annually since 2011) (ICES-WGEF 2018). Some ICES member countries may be reporting landings of the Spiny Dogfish under a generic name (e.g. <em>Squalus </em>sp.) In the Mediterranean, most targeted fishing ceased in the 1970s with the decline in stock; however, unregulated and incidental capture still occurs in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (e.g. Ţoţoiu <em>et al. </em>2016, Bonanomi <em>et al. </em>2018). In the Mediterranean, Spiny Dogfish is considered a bycatch species, but catches are fully commercialized (Serena<em> et al.</em> 2009b, Farrugio and Soldo 2013). Targeted fisheries in the Black Sea were once operated by Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine; following reductions of Spiny Dogfish stock in the region observed in the 1990s, most of the fisheries closed and today Bulgaria is the only country with a targeted fishery in the region (Shlyakhov and Daskalov&#160;<a>2008).</a></p>      <p>Landings of Spiny Dogfish from the Northwest Atlantic peaked in 1974 at ~25,000 t, and again in 1996 at ~28,000 t; the majority of landings between 1979–2000 were reported from the United States fisheries. <a>The driver behind these fisheries has been international trade to satisfy the European market demand (Dell'Apa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;The species is currently not commercially fished in Canada, but is reported as bycatch in industrial and recreational fisheries (DFO 2020). </a>Spiny Dogfish is still fished commercially in U.S.waters, but according to the 2018 stock status update, the population is not currently overfished or subject to overfishing (NOAA 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Africa, Spiny Dogfish is infrequently reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) from South African industrial demersal longline fisheries, including those targeting sharks (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Some African countries, particularly Mauritania, appear to be intensifying Spiny Dogfish fishing to supply the European&#160;market demand in recent years (FAO 2009, Dell’Apa<em> et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>In Argentina, the Spiny Dogfish is reported as bycatch in industrial fisheries (e.g. Cedrola <em>et al. </em>2012, Crespi-Abril <em>et al.</em> 2013). Catches have been difficult to monitor since the species may be misidentified, reported under a generic category of ""shark"", or processed at sea (making species identification not possible) and historically, the species was discarded for lack of commercial value (Chiaramonte 1998). Increased commercial landings of the species were first noted in the early 2000s after the collapse of Argentina's primary fishery, hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>). It has not been possible to estimate the volume of Spiny Dogfish landings, but it is known that the species is not as frequently landed as other regional sharks (Narrownose Smoothhound, <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, and Tope, <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>) (G. Chiaramonte pers. comm. 22/04/2020). Retention of the species is largely influenced by international market forces (Chiaramonte 2006).&#160;Increased exploitation from South American countries (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile) is expected if European demand increases; exports of the species from Argentina increased after strict management measures began to take effect in the US around 2000 (Dell’Apa <em>et al. </em>2013). In Argentina, fisheries are characterized by declining catches, a shift to species of lower trophic levels, and an increase in catch coming from overexploited stocks (Pauly and Zeller 2015). Nearly two thirds of all Argentina stocks were overexploited or collapsed in 2014 (Pauly and Zeller 2015). The species is reported in both Chilean (SUBPESCA 2017) and Argentinian hake fisheries (Núñez <em>et al. </em>2018); the latter of which has 566 trawlers in operation.</p><p>In the Southwest Pacific, New Zealand data pre-1980 are unavailable, but landings were likely to be negligible given its low value (Francis 1998, FNZ 2019). Landings increased in the late 1980s and 1990s, but fluctuated considerably depending on market forces and the species availability and the amount of effort directed at target species (Francis 1998). Spiny Dogfish is one of the primary bycatch species in New Zealand offshore fisheries (Finucci <em>et al.</em> 2019) and the most reported chondrichthyan from New Zealand fisheries (Francis 2015). In Australia, the species has been reported from Tasmanian recreational gillnet fisheries (Fordham 2005), as well as industrial trawl, dropline, and longline fisheries; average annual industrial catch is low (&lt;4 t) and it is thought the species has minimal exposure to fishing gear (Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In addition to fishing activities, Spiny Dogfish may be threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Coastal development, pollution, dredging, and bottom trawling affect coastal or demersal habitat that the species’ prey relies on (ASMFC 2002). In Chile, spatial overlap of nursery areas and aquaculture farms have been identified; the effect of this interaction appears to influence the diet of the Spiny Dogfish, but any effect on the species' reproductive output is unknown (Gaitán-Espitia <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>              </p>  <p></p>","Population genetics show little or no mixing between Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations, and limited genetic mixing between some stocks with overlapping range (Veríssimo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). There are suspected to be three distinct subpopulations (Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea) in European waters. Where population trend data were available, data were analysed over three generation lengths (51 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Working Group on Elasmobranch Fishes (WGEF) considers Northeast Atlantic Spiny Dogfish, ranging from Barents Sea to Bay of Biscay, to be a single stock, and uses data collected from this area for developing assessments and management advice (ICES-WGEF 2018). Total biomass and recruitment of Spiny Dogfish in this region declined considerably between the 1960s to the mid-2000s; more recent trends suggest the stock stabilised over last decade and has started to recover. Total biomass is estimated at 390,358 t, approximately 20% of historic levels (ICES-WGEF&#160;2018). Analysis of international and national surveys available from the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) between 1970–2004 showed annual catch rates of Spiny Dogfish from the North Sea declining over time (Daan&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005). This is considered the most comprehensive survey data set available for the North Sea. Using the ICES and IBTS data, the trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 1.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of&#160;63.7% over three generation lengths (51 years),&#160;with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/> <br/> In the Mediterranean Sea, evidence of considerable population reduction (&gt;90%) has been reported across part of the range of Spiny Dogfish (based on commercial and research trawl surveys over 1972–2004 period, Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Between 1994–2004, the European Union program Mediterranean International Trawl Survey Program (MEDITS) provided indices of summer abundance per standardized area (per km2) from the Alboran to the Aegeans Seas in weight and number (Serena&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009a).&#160;The Spiny Dogfish was found to be one of the most abundant species by weight with estimated biomass of 6,700 mt; however, the spatial distribution of the species was found to be fairly confined, with the Spiny Dogfish reported in only 5% of tows (Serena&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009a). No trends in abundance were observed over this time period. Combining nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) trawl (catch per km², Ferretti<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005) and relative abundance trawl data (kg/km², Serena<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009a), the trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 9.7%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.4% over three generation lengths,&#160;with the highest probability of 80–99% reduction over three generation lengths (51 years).&#160;<a>This is, however, not considered representative of the species' entire Mediterranean distribution.<strong>&#160;</strong></a>In the Black Sea, the 2017 rate of fishing mortality was estimated to be nearly ten times higher than the fishing mortality reference point and the stock here is considered depleted (GFCM, 2018a).<br/><br/>The Spiny Dogfish population in the Northwest Atlantic straddles the Canada-US boundary, with most of the population found in US waters in most years (DFO 2014).&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">Since 1930, up to 24,000 mt of the species was landed&#160;annually, with most catch reported from the US. In Canada, landings were small pre-1979, but averaged&#160;1,000-2,000 mt annually until 2002, increased to 2,500 mt between 2000–2008 and have been markedly lower in recent years (5 mt in 2010). The most recent stock assessment determine that the population is not overfished and not experiencing overfishing, with the current spawning stock biomass is estimated at ~100,000 t (235 million pounds) (NOAA 2019). The 2018 biomass was 67% of the&#160;<a>target (MAFMC 2019)</a>. The U.S. Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)&#160;spring survey, associated with a 51-year time series, is considered to be the best reflection of regional population trends for the species. The biomass index from this survey has shown high inter-annual variability, but a general upward trend across the series. On the Scotian Shelf of Canada, surveys have shown similar upward fluctuating trends (DFO 2014). Using relative female biomass estimates between 1970–2018 (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019),&#160;the trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.5%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 345.3% over three generation lengths (51 years),&#160;with the highest probability of no reduction over three generation lengths.<span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><br/><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><span lang=""EN-CA""><br/>In New Zealand, the Spiny Dogfish is considered to have a relatively large population, with an estimated total industrial catch of 24,865 t reported between 2008–09 and 2012–13 fishing years (Ford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Relative biomass estimates from fisheries independent research trawl surveys have showed stable or increasing trends since the early 1990s (FNZ 2019). Using relative biomass estimates from fisheries independent research trawl surveys from Chatham Rise (1992–2010), Sub-Antarctic (1991–93, 2000–2009), East Coast South Island (1991–2018), and West Coast South Island (1992–2017) off New Zealand (FNZ 2019), the trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of&#160;1.7%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;120.5% over three generation lengths, with the highest probability of&#160;<a>no major reductions in population over three generation lengths.</a><br/><br/>Elsewhere, catches of the species are relatively small, with &lt;1 t reported from South African industrial fisheries between&#160;2010–12 (da Silva&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;In Argentina, species-specific data are not available. Landings of all sharks in Argentina increased from ~6,000 to ~30,000 mt between 1979–1996 (Chiaramonte, 1998), and between the 2000–2012, an average of 38,000 t of sharks were landed annually (Bernasconi and Navarro 2014). In Chile, Spiny Dogfish catches observed in an artisanal longline skate fishery were greater in terms of fish size and CPUE in the 1990s compared to those in 2003–04 (Quiroz <em>et al. </em>2008).

Although this species has a wide distribution; the level of recreational spear-fishing is estimated to have caused a 30% decline in global population, with particular localised declines as high as 60% (Florida). This decline is thought to have occurred over three generations, which qualifies it for Vulnerable status. Although regulations including maximum size, and gear restrictions have been introduced across the Caribbean the threat from exploitation has not ceased. Further information on population and harvesting levels are required (in particular monitoring of CPUE data) to allow assessment of population trends and threat levels in to the future.","<em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> is found on coral reefs at 3-40 m depth, especially sandy outer reef slopes. Juveniles are most common in shallow seagrass, and inshore reef habitats.<br/><br/>It is a monadric protogynous hermaphrodite (McBride and Johnson 2007) with a very slow rate of sex change (several months that occurs post spawning). It has an extended spawning season from January to May. In Florida, females attain sexual maturity at two years 26.0 cm (FL), sexual transition at three to five years but recorded in individuals up to 13 years. Reproductive aggregations have been observed in Los Roques (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008). &#160;<br/><br/>There is considerable variation in growth and age structure over the geographic range of this species. The most detailed account (McBride and Richardson 2007) compared growth and age structure of populations from the eastern Gulf of Mexico and southern Florida (Easten Gulf of Mexico - max. age 23 years; max. size 82.4 cm (FL); <span class=""bodytext"">von Bertalanffy Growth Function Linf 91.7 cm;&#160; k .014; mortality rate 0.35, and South Florida -&#160; max. age 13 years; Max size 62.2 cm (FL); <span class=""bodytext"">von Bertalanffy Growth Function Linf 42.8 cm;&#160; k .045 mortality rate 0.4).<br/><br/>A broader survey of&#160; four Atlantic locations revealed the following: (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008) Margarita (Venezuela) -&#160; max. age five years, max. size 35.3 cm; Los Roques (Ven) - max. age 10 years, max. size 68.7 cm; Belize - max. age seven years max. size 55.4 cm; Bermuda - max. age 16 years, max. size 84.4 cm. In addition, mortality rates estimates from catch curves from Margarita and Belize (0.8, 0.7) both heavily fished, were double those from Los Roques and Bermuda where only light fishing occurs. <br/><br/>All populations examined for age distribution in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, South Florida, (McBride and Richardson 2007)&#160; Belize, Los Roques, Bermuda, Margarita (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008) revealed that distribution was strongly skewed to the younger age classes varying from one to four years. Abundance estimates by Underwater Visual Census in Belize and Los Roques (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008) revealed low densities (0.81-0.95 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>). No counts of aggregations were made.</span>","<em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> is harvested as a food source although is of minor commercial importance and is mainly caught using hook and line. It is marketed as the 'Hog Snapper'. This species has been implicated in ciguatera (Robins <em>et al</em>. 1986). The 2005 total landings of <em>L. maximus</em> were 13% lower than the average landings over the previous five years (2000-2004) and were 42% lower than the historic average landings (1982-2005) (FWRI 2006). The latest stock assessment (SEDAR and SAFMC 2004) indicated that the hogfish fishery was severely overfished and has been for the last two decades in Florida waters (FWRI 2006). This has impacted upon the growth and recruitment of this species.<br/><br/>Coral reefs of the Caribbean had been heavily damaged by disease, coastal development, coral bleaching, and over-fishing. It is predicted that reefs away from population centres will remain healthy in the future, unless the adverse predictions for global climate change, of more tropical storms and bleaching occur (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2004). <em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> is also a common species within the aquarium trade.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure on this species has increased since the 1970s (Bohnsack <em>et al</em>. 1994) it is possible the size at maturity could decrease over time (McBride 2001). This species is currently in decline around Puerto Rico (Ojeda-Serrano <em>et al</em>. 2007). The estimated number of hogfish landed between 1980 and 1992 in the Monroe County area fell from 180,917 to 21,813 (Bohnsack <em>et al</em>. 1994). These figures fluctuated in this time period but demonstrated an overall decline.<br/><br/>Tupper and Rudd (2002) found that fishing pressure and depth had a marked influence on hogfish length, density and biomass, with these attributes being significantly higher on deeper reefs. In fished areas the length, density and biomass of hogfish were all significantly lower when compared to a nearby protected area. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was much lower (half or less) in the fished zone when compared to lightly-fished or protected zones.<br/>Although there is evidence of exploitation across this species' range the reasons behind them are understood and reversible (H. Choat pers. comm. 2009). Also, overfishing does not seem to have had an impact on recruitment (H. Choat pers. comm. 2009).","In the past <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lachnolaimus maximus</span> had moderate abundance over shallow west Atlantic coral reefs, but is now depleted in many areas due to fishing. Large populations are maintained at only a few sites including Los Roques (Venezuela), Bermuda and at some sites in the Florida Keys (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008). Overall the population has declined over most of its range. <br/><br/>Ault <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2003) report high harvesting rates for Florida with declining returns of 272 metric t in 1987 to 154 metric t in 1993 and averaging 93 metric t from 1998-2001. This represents a decline of approximately 60% over a period of 14 years. The declines are still continuing (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008). Considering together all catch and census data on the species from throughout its geographic range, it is clear that declines of at least 30% must have occurred within the last few generations (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/>This species is another of the large hypsigenyine labrids that reaches a large size but has very low population densities. At Los Roques aggregations of approximately 50 large individuals were found on shallow sandy slopes (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008).",Decreasing,"<em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> is present in the Caribbean and north to Bermuda and the Carolinas and extends southwards to the northern region of the Brazilian Coast. <br/><br/>This species is present in the following countries: Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda; Aruba; Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; Bermuda; Canada; Cayman Islands; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Dominica; Dominican Republic; French Guiana; Grenada; Guadeloupe; Guatemala; Guyana; Haiti; Honduras; Jamaica; Martinique; Mexico; Montserrat; Netherlands Antilles (Curaçao); Nicaragua; Panama; Puerto Rico; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Suriname; Trinidad and Tobago; Turks and Caicos Islands; United States; Venezuela; Virgin Islands, British; Virgin Islands, U.S., NE Brazil (Floeter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007).",<em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> is harvested as a food source although is of minor commercial importance and is mainly caught using hook and line.,Marine,"The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) have established regulations for removal of <em>Lachnolaimus maximus</em> for both commercial and recreational purposes. These include a maximum landing size of 30.5 cm, gear restrictions, and a daily bag allowance of five hogfish per day for recreational fishers. There are a number of no-take zones in the Caribbean and total fishing is restricted to just over 300,000 ha of the wider Caribbean.&#160;<br/><br/>Ault <em>et al</em>. (2003) suggest restricting recreational fishing in particular areas by limiting the use of SCUBA gear with spear fishing and/or limiting the amount of time during a year that spear fishing may be undertaken. Further research and monitoring of the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed to ensure that any future population declines are noted.<br/><br/>Catch per unit effort (CPUE) was much lower (half or less) in the fished zone when compared to a lightly-fished or protected zone. CPUE of hogfish decreased with increasing distance from the reserve, which suggests that spillover from the protected area can enhance the local fishery yields outside its boundaries. This indicates increasing the area covered by protected zones would benefit this species (Tupper and Rudd 2002).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Given that <em>H. comes</em> is among the most commonly traded (Evanson <em>et al</em>. 2011) seahorse species, particularly dried for traditional medicine trade and live for the aquarium trade, evidence of declines in seahorse availability raises concern for this species.<br/><br/>Population decline in other areas outside of the Philippines remain unknown (Morgan and Lourie, 2006) but the abundances of <em>H. comes</em> surveyed in several&#160; islands of the Philippines where fishing occurs are low and there is also evidence in declines in the availability of seahorses in general, including <em>H. comes </em>(Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Morgan and Lourie, 2006). Although more recent data do not exist, an increasing human population combined with only minor successes in conservation indicate that the threats outlined here are and will be persisting into the future.<br/><br/>A precautionary listing of Vulnerable (VU A2cd+4cd) is warranted, inferring overall numeric declines of 30-50% in the past and future.","<p><em>H. comes</em> is found on coral reefs, in seagrass beds, and in macroalgal beds in shallow waters from the low tide line to 10m with the deepest record of 20m. (Lourie <em>et al</em>. 2004; Morgan and Lourie 2006). This species displays ontogenetic differences in its use of habitat at the scale of reef zones with juveniles (25 -105 mm, standard length) most abundant in wild macro-algal beds (<em>Sargassum </em>spp.) while adults (&gt;105 mm, standard length) occupy both coral reefs and macro-algal habitats (Morgan and Lourie 2006, Morgan and Vincent 2007, Morgan 2008 (PhD thesis)). In reefs, adults prefer to seek shelter within or under structures by day and rise up to grasp holdfasts by night (Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Morgan and Vincent 2007).&#160; </p>  <p>Like all seahorse species, <em>H. comes</em> exhibits ecological and life-history traits which may make it particularly susceptible to threats.&#160; These traits include vital parental care, high site fidelity (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002), highly structured social behaviour (Vincent and Sadler 1995), and relatively sparse distributions (Lourie <em>et al.</em> 2004). Other similarly important traits in <em>H. comes</em> and other seahorses, such as small body size, fast growth rate, ontogenetic shifts in habitat preference, crepuscular &#160;habits and high fecundity may grant resilience towards exploitation pressures (Perante <em>et al.</em> 2002; Morgan and Vincent, 2007). However, given increasing fishing pressures, habitat degradation of many heavily fished inshore waters and some traits that convey vulnerability, the species is at risk of overexploitation. The importance of life history parameters in determining response to exploitation has been demonstrated for a number of species (Jennings <em>et al.</em> 1998, Foster and Vincent 2004).</p>","<em></em>The main threats to <em>Hippocampus comes</em> are direct exploitation, habitat destruction and incidental catch. The species is exploited to supply the traditional medicine, curio and aquarium trades (Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010, Lim <em>et al.</em> 2011). the majority of which is sourced from incidental bycatch in commercial and artisanal fishers throughout its range in Malaysia and Thailand (Choo and Liew 2003, Perry <em>et al.</em> 2010), Vietnam (Giles <em>et al.</em> 2006) and the Philippines (Vincent<em> et al. </em>2007).     <p>Pressures on <em>H. comes</em> in the central Philippines is particularly high with target capture, destructive fishing and macroalgal farming (Morgan and Vincent 2007). The reefs that comprise a major habitat for this species are threatened by land-based activities such as coastal development, siltation and pollution (Burke <em>et al.</em> 2002). Destructive fisheries such as blast fisheries and cyanide fishing occur throughout the species’ range, causing coral and seagrass damage (Gomez 1997, Short <em>et al.</em> 2011), These habitats are vital to the ecology of <em>H. comes</em> (Morgan and Vincent 2007) and the decline in suitable habitats throughout the species range raises the probability of decline in population in addition to other threats. Extremely low H. comes densities were reported in areas with poor benthic quality suggesting that activities which reduce the variety of benthic forms may negatively affect the species (Marcus <em>et al.</em> 2007). </p>  <em></em>","While detailed population numbers of <em>H.comes</em> remain unknown, the species has been studied <em>in situ</em> in the central Phillipines since 1995 (Vincent and Parajo 1997, Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Morgan and Vincent 2007, Morgan 2008 (PhD thesis)). Densities of <em>Hippocampus comes</em> around Jandayan Island on the north-western edge of Bohol, were low with a mean density of 0.019 m<sup>-2</sup>, while densities for the other nearby islands (Cataban, Saag, Sagasa and Mahanay Island, Bohol) were even lower, at 0.00143 m<sup>-2 </sup>(Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Morgan and Vincent 2007). Density varies meaningfully by habitat type and life history stage, where juveniles show marked preference for wild macroalgal beds, versus adults which occur in greatest densities in coral reef environments (Morgan and Vincent 2007).<br/><br/>Densities of <em>H.comes</em> appear to respond to Marine Protected Areas (MPA) where a mean density of 0.019 m<sup>-2</sup> was recorded inside protected waters on Jandayan Island, Philippines, as compared to densities outside the MPA (0.0005 m<sup>-2</sup>) (Perante <em>et al</em>. 2002, Marcus <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates in 2007 were the lowest recorded for <em>H.comes</em> with over 90% of surveyed transects containing no seahorses (Marcus <em>et al</em>. 2007). Historical, anecdotal reports from fishers in Bohol mentioned densities up to 20 individual m<sup>-2</sup>: although there are known discrepancies with historical fisher data (O’Donnell <em>et al</em>. 2010) there is no doubt that there has been a significant decrease in seahorse densities in areas with active fisheries.<br/><br/>In Malaysia and Thailand, fishers and traders reported declines in seahorse supply, including <em>Hippocampus comes</em> (Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010). Data from the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database show a decline in trade volume from Thailand (6.5 million individuals in 2004 to 3.7 million individuals in 2008) while Malaysia showed an increasing trend from 2,500 individuals in 2004 to 595,000 individuals in 2008 (Evanson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The longevity of these animals is estimated to be 3.2 years and the estimated age of maturity is at 3.8 months (Morgan and Vincent 2013). Declines under criterion A must be considered over 10 years, which constitutes longer than three generations. Fishers in Bohol, central Philippines, reported a decline in mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 24 seahorses per night per fisher in 1986–1990 to 2.9 seahorses per night per fisher in 1996–1999 (Morgan and Lourie 2006). Declines in CPUE have been estimated throughout central Philippines: CPUE in Bohol declined by 67% in lantern fishing between 1980–2000, Eastern Samar by 93% in lantern fishing CPUE between 1980–2000, Surigao del Norte by 100% in beach seining CPUE between 1975–2006 (A. Maypa, unpublished in Morgan and Lourie 2006).<br/><br/>The declines in CPUE over the past show a suspected decline of at least 70% (Vincent and Pajaro&#160; 1997, A. Maypa unpublished data in Morgan and Lourie&#160; 2006). As the central Philippines is where the species is believed to occur at greatest natural densities, and because it is reasonable that the threats facing this species here would be similar throughout it’s range (Morgan and Lourie 2006), we conservatively assume a decline of at least 30-50% throughout its range between 1995 and 2005.<br/><br/>More recent data for <em>Hippocampus comes </em>is unavailable, however growing human populations in the range countries indicate that these threats are not likely to have subsided, and likely will not in the near future.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Hippocampus comes</em> occurs in coastal areas of the southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Andaman Islands.<br/></p>","<p><em>Hippocampus comes</em> is considered valuable to the aquarium, traditional medicine and curio trades and is among the most commonly traded seahorse species (Vincent 1996, Perry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Evanson <em>et al</em>, 2011),.&#160;</p>Live <em>H.comes</em> sold for aquarium and hobbyist purposes are often caught directly from the wild (Vincent 1996).

The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 1,316 km<sup>2</sup>. It is commercially fished throughout its range, including the targeting of spawning aggregations by legal and illegal fishing. Catches increased significantly during the time period from 1993 to the present. Despite some conservation measures put in place by the Mexican government since 2005, fishing regulations are not sufficient, illegal fishing activity has increased and fishing pressure is currently&#160;unsustainable at a level that could lead to collapse in the near future. An additional major threat is the large-scale loss of juvenile habitat since the 1960s caused by the alteration of the Colorado River flow due to the installation of upstream dams. Based on its AOO estimate, locations of less than 5 and inferred continuing decline in habitat quality and mature individuals, it is listed as Vulnerable B2ab(iii,v). Improvements in population monitoring as well as fisheries management are recommended.","This benthopelagic species inhabits coastal waters, including estuaries. Adults feed on crustaceans, molluscs, anchovies and sardines (Román-Rodríguez 2000). Adults&#160;migrate to form large, annual&#160;spawning aggregations in the Colorado River delta and estuary in the weeks preceding new and full moons in March and April.&#160;The timing of aggregation is linked to the historic timing of spring floods of the Colorado River, which provided an extensive brackish nursery habitat&#160;for juveniles (Rowell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005; 2008; Erisman <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). This species can attain at least 101 cm in length and 8 years of age. The average length at sexual maturity for this species is 29.5 cm for females and 26.8 cm for males. Age at maturity is two years for both sexes (Gherard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). When applying an age at first reproduction of 2 years and longevity of 8 years, its estimated generation length is 5 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","Overfishing and habitat degradation are major threats to this species. Targeting of spawning aggregations by fishers contributes to declines. Since the 1960s, the Colorado River ceased to flow consistently due to the installation of upstream dams. This has caused the near elimination of the nursery habitat of this species.","Historically, the Colorado River Estuary once extended up to 70 km south into the upper Gulf of California, creating an area of&#160;4,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of fresh and brackish-water habitat (Carbajal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, Lavín and Sánchez 1999). Since the installation of upstream dams, the Colorado River has rarely reached the Gulf since the 1960s. It is now a negative estuary where salinity has a very high average of 38‰ (Lavín and Sánchez 1999, Calderon-Aguilera&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Due to this loss of habitat, this species declined and became commercially extinct in the 1960s (Román <em>et al.</em> 1998). In 1993, a controlled release of Colorado River water dramatically increased flows to the Gulf of California, and in the three years after the release, catches of this species in the fishing village of El Golfo de Santa Clara increased from 32 t in 1993 to 1,278 t in 1996 (CONAPESCA 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>Due in part to the heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations, the species is now overexploited and nearing collapse.

Catch quotas were exceeded in the years from 2012 to 2016, with the exception of 2014. Catches have been composed of mega-breeders as well as juveniles, and this has raised concern that fishing is unsustainable and at risk for future collapse in the short or medium term.

In addition, several studies have documented large-scale degradation in shallow coral and rocky reef habitats in both Cocos Island and the Galápagos due to impacts from strong El Niño events. Under the current predictions for greenhouse warming, extreme conditions associated with El Niño are projected to increase, and this is expected to have detrimental impacts on the survival of this species.&#160;The entirety of this species' range overlaps with two marine protected areas - the Galápagos Marine Reserve and the Cocos Island National Park; however, conservation measures associated with these areas will not protect it from climate change impacts.

El Niño events cause anomalously high temperatures in shallow waters that leads to nutrient poor conditions for extended periods of time (Grove 1985, Guzmán and Cortés 1992, Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2010). The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is particularly susceptible to high impacts from El Niño events as it is located near where the most intense changes in water temperature occur (Glynn and Ault 2000). During the 1982/1983 El Niño, the coral reefs of both Cocos Island and the Galápagos experienced a catastrophic degradation event; recovery has occurred in some areas, but has been relatively low overall (Guzmán and Cortés 1992, Glynn <em>et al</em>. 2018). The same event caused large-scale changes in the shallow marine environments of the Galápagos, including diebacks of macroalgae, and as a result, several endemic marine species experienced severe declines (Edgar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;At the height of the El Niño&#160;of 2014-2017, benthic cyanobacterial mats rapidly proliferated on shallow, subtidal rocky reefs in the central Galapagos to an extent that reduced the growth of algae, altering reef ecosystem structure and function (Beltram <em>et al.</em> 2019). An outbreak of an ulcerative skin disease in the Galápagos that caused serious declines in several reef fish species during the 2016 El Niño event is thought to have been facilitated by thermal and nutritional stress. Though several of these species recovered upon the return of La Niña conditions, the expected increase in frequency of extreme El Niño events is cause for concern (Lamb<em> et al</em>. 2018). As shallow reefs are the primary habitat for this nearshore species, this is cause for concern, but the species-specific impact is poorly understood.&#160;<br/><br/>The frequency, duration and strength of El Niño events in the region composed of the upwelling zone off the coast of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and the offshore islands has increased over the past millennium (Glynn and Ault 2000, Soto 2002, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Conroy <em>et al. </em>2009). Modeling studies indicate that under the current predictions for greenhouse warming, extreme weather events associated with El Niño are projected to increase (Cai <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Pollution from agricultural chemicals, sewage and litter may also exacerbate degradation of marine habitats. Oil slicks from oil extraction in the region (Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and soon Ghana) is also a threat to fishes.

Though specific data are not available for this species, severe declines have been observed in the Galápagos&#160;in other fish species with similar ecology. In addition, several studies have documented large-scale degradation in shallow coral and rocky reef habitats in both Cocos Island and the Galápagos due to impacts from strong El Niño events. Under the current predictions for greenhouse warming, extreme conditions associated with El Niño are projected to increase, and this is expected to have detrimental impacts on the survival of this species.&#160;The entirety of this species' range overlaps with two marine protected areas - the Galápagos Marine Reserve and the Cocos Island National Park; however, conservation measures associated with these areas will not protect it from climate change impacts.

It feeds on mobile benthic crustaceans, worms and gastropods. The maximum total&#160;length is 45 cm (Chao 1995).","Extreme shifts in water temperature associated with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major threat to this species. El Niño events cause anomalously high temperatures in shallow waters that leads to nutrient poor conditions for extended periods of time (Grove 1985, Guzmán and Cortés 1992, Edgar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is particularly susceptible to high impacts from El Niño events as it is located near where the most intense changes in water temperature occur (Glynn and Ault 2000). During the 1982/1983 El Niño, the coral reefs of both Cocos Island and the Galápagos experienced a catastrophic degradation event; recovery has occurred in some areas, but has been relatively low overall (Guzmán and Cortés 1992, Glynn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). The same event caused large-scale changes in the shallow marine environments of the Galápagos, including diebacks of macroalgae, and as a result, several endemic marine species experienced severe declines (Edgar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;At the height of the El Niño&#160;of 2014-2017, benthic cyanobacterial mats rapidly proliferated on shallow, subtidal rocky reefs in the central Galapagos to an extent that reduced the growth of algae, altering reef ecosystem structure and function (Beltram&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An outbreak of an ulcerative skin disease in the Galápagos that caused serious declines in several reef fish species during the 2016 El Niño event is thought to have been facilitated by thermal and nutritional stress. Though several of these species recovered upon the return of La Niña conditions, the expected increase in frequency of extreme El Niño events is cause for concern (Lamb<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018). Since this species is dependent on nearshore habitats such as these, there is cause for concern, but the species-specific impact is poorly understood.&#160;<br/><br/>The frequency, duration and strength of El Niño events in the region composed of the upwelling zone off the coast of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica and the offshore islands has increased over the past millennium (Glynn and Ault 2000, Soto 2002, Chen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Conroy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Modeling studies indicate that under the current predictions for greenhouse warming, extreme weather events associated with El Niño are projected to increase (Cai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Given this species' restricted distribution and shallow water habitat, oceanographic environmental changes, such as those associated with future El Niño events, are expected to have detrimental impacts on the survival of this species.","Population data are limited for this species. Only a single record is known from Cocos Island, and it is considered to be rare there (Robertson and Allen 2015). A survey conducted in 2000-2001 in several different reef sites in the Galápagos Archipelago did not report this species (Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2004). It was recorded in all three mangrove bays surveyed during a study conducted off Santa Cruz Island in 2010-2011 (Llerena-Martillo<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018).

Therefore, for the purposes of the assessment, the geographic range of<em> T. toli </em>is restricted to the estuarine localities and adjacent areas in Sarawak, Malaysia from which it is confirmed.<br/><br/>This species is an estuarine, protandrous hermaphrodite that does not enter fresh or marine waters and is non-migratory, therefore subpopulations in each estuary may be relatively isolated from one another and hence particularly&#160;susceptible to overfishing. It has only been recorded to spawn in the Lupar and the Lassa estuaries, though ripe females have also been collected from the Sadong estuary; individuals presumably spawn in the Saribas as well as adjacent estuaries, though more research is needed. As this species breeds in estuaries, its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 570 km² by converting the four estuaries (Lassa, Lupar, Sadong and Saribas) and adjacent estuaries where this species is known and presumed to spawn into a 4 km² grid. This qualifies <em>T. toli</em> for Vulnerable under criterion B2. <br/><br/>This  species is commercially important and is a highly valued food fish that  is also heavily targeted for its roe and taken as bycatch in the <em>T. macrura</em> fishery. Limited  information is available related to its population, but it is  apparently locally and seasonally uncommon and has experienced major  declines in recent years (1980s - 2014) due to the over-fishing of ripe  females and small males within critical spawning habitat; as such, a  decline in mature individuals is suspected.

This species is a protandrous hermaphrodite that reaches maturity as a male in year 1, spawns, and changes sex at 2 years (~20 cm) to female (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1996, Milton <em>et al.</em> 1997, D. Milton pers. com. 2011). Maximum longevity is estimated to be 3 - 4 years (D. Milton pers. com. 2011) and the maximum known standard length is about 45 cm (Rahim <em>et al</em>. 2014). Spawning takes place during the dry season from May to September in the middle reaches of the rivers (the Lupar and Lassa: Milton <em>et al. </em>1997). Fecundity varies between 420 - 450,000 eggs each spawning and they may spawn more than once per season. This species apparently does not move into full seawater, or freshwater, but completes its life cycle in estuarine and adjacent coastal waters (Blaber <em>et al. </em>1996, Milton <em>et al.</em> 1997) where it likely only moves locally and is not migratory. Therefore, subpopulations present in each estuary and adjacent coastal waters may be relatively isolated from one another (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1996). Its diet consists of zooplankton, primarily calanoid copepods (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong>","<p>This species is mainly threatened by overexploitation and has drastically declined since the 1980s (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1997). The decline in its fishery is similar to other tropical clupeids of the genus, including <em>T. macrura</em> (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1996), <em>T. thibaudeaui </em>(Roberts 1993, Navy <em>et al.</em> 2009) and <em>T. reevesii</em> (Wang 1996: Blaber <em>et al. </em>1999). Catches for this species have purportedly declined drastically in recent decades as a result of intensive fishing in areas of aggregated juveniles and spawning females, which are specifically targeted for their ovaries (Willman<em> et al. </em>1989). As such, a decline in mature individuals (both, males and females) is suspected. It is possible that the protandrous habit of this species has made it vulnerable to overfishing similar to <em>T. macrura </em>(Blaber <em>et al</em>. 1999). Additionally, this species likely only moves locally and is not migratory; therefore, subpopulations present in each estuary and adjacent coastal waters may be relatively isolated from one another, and hence are particularly susceptible to overfishing (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 1996). Furthermore, the estuaries where this species is present are negatively impacted by habitat degradation, such as pollution from large-scale industrial developments (especially palm oil: NEPcon 2017); more research is needed to determine the extent this species is impacted. No evidence suggests that these processes have stopped, therefore it is inferred that there is a continuing decline in habitat quality.</p>","This species is locally and seasonally uncommon in the estuaries and off the coasts of Sarawak, Malaysia and has experienced major declines in recent years.

This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the  number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from  over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 from 1992 to 2015. The overall number of  fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in  1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación  Pesquera, 2016). In the San Matías Gulf, Patagonia this species occurred in 100% of the trawl catches and comprised 21.5% of the relative abundance in terms of the number of individuals captured (Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011), and off Chubut province, this skate was caught and landed in 11% of trawls in one study of the hake and shrimp trawls conducted between 2005 and 2014 (<span class=""more-by-this-author "">Núñez <em>et al.</em> 2016). Of the skates identified to species, the Shorttail Yellownose Skate comprised 259.4 t of reported catch in 2019, while the total catch of&#160;<span lang=""EN-CA"">all other identified species was 365.1 tons in total (in 2019).

In southern Brazil, the Shorttail Yellownose Skate is subjected to intense industrial and  artisanal fishing pressure, and it is suspected that this has led to  declines in abundance. It is intensively fished in Uruguay, though skates are not reported to the species level and trawl landings have declined somewhat over the years. In Argentina, reported landings of skates in  general increased from 900  t  in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and  then declined to 24,000 t   in 2009–2010 and to 11,000 t in 2019 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y  Pesca 2010, cited   in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Trawl landings data from all the  Southwest Atlantic for all combined rays &gt;90 cm total length in size show a sharp increase in the 1990s and 2000s,  from   less than 1,000 t to a peak of nearly 4,000 t in 2007 followed by a decline to 1,000–1,500 t between 2008–2013 despite increased  effort  (Port <em>et al. </em>2016, FAO 2019). This decline is equivalent to a  population reduction of &gt;99% when scaled over three generation lengths of the Shorttail Yellownose Skate (39  years). These reported landings  data are not  species-specific, but  they suggest a substantial increase  in fishing  pressure over the  past several decades, and the more recent  declines in landings may  represent a reduction in population size. Although it is still common in catches, due to heavy fishing pressure across its range, inadequate management measures, its high catchability, and declines in reported overall skate landings, it is suspected that the Shorttail Yellownose Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (39 years).<span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span style=""""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Shorttail Yellownose Skate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil to the Beagle Channel in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina (Gabbanelli <em>et al. </em>2018).","Skates in the region are sold locally or  traded internationally to Asian markets for meat, mostly to Korea (Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this skate.

In South and Southeast Asia 65% of coral reefs have been effectively lost and an average of 24% have been lost among North Asia and the Southwest Pacific Islands between 1988 - 2008 where&#160;<em>G.</em><em>&#160;aoyagii</em><em>&#160;</em>occurs. In addition, of the reefs remaining in South and Southeast Asia, 40% of them are at a critical stage with 22% and 17% of those in North Asia and the Southwest Pacific Islands, respectively, also at a critical stage. Over the past 10 years, given the severity of local and regional threats to coral reef ecosystems, as well as the impact of ocean acidification and increasing warming events, the rate of decline is not likely to have changed. Since this species is reliant on coral reef habitats and cannot survive on bleached or algae covered corals, it is an appropriate proxy for species population estimates. This species has experienced an average habitat decline (effectively lost reefs) of about 45% across its range from 1988 - 2008 resulting an estimated decline in habitat of about 27% over the past 10 years (2008 - 2018). This documented decline approaches the criteria for a Vulnerable listing but given the likelihood of continued coral habitat decline in the regions where this species occurs in addition to the documented critical stage reefs, habitat decline over a 10 year timeframe spanning some past and some future, e.g. 2015-2025, probably exceeds 30%.

It is heavily targeted by fishers throughout its range, and has experienced historical population declines as a result. A variety of intrinsic characteristics (e.g., late-maturing, long-lived, aggregate spawning behaviour, predictable occurrence and lack of fear of human presence) make it particularly susceptible to overfishing. It may also be a protogynous hermaphrodite, but that is awaiting confirmation.<br/><br/>In the southeastern U.S., this species experienced a two generation length time period of severe decline from the 1950s to the early 1990s, during which the population declined to near-zero or by at least 84%. A stock assessment model published in 2016 indicated there has been an absolute population reduction of about 33% from 1950 to 2014. A fishing moratorium has been in place in U.S. waters for the past 27 years or since 1990, and the population has been mostly increasing as a result, but is not yet fully recovered. In Brazil, declines in population, including aggregation size, have occurred, but the time period is unknown and the percent is not quantified. A fishing ban has been in place in Brazilian waters since 2002, however, due to lack of enforcement in most areas, poaching continues and fishing mortality reduction is still limited; therefore, the status of its population in Brazil is unknown, but likely remains at a reduced level. Unquantified, but serious declines have also occurred in Cuba, Mexico and Belize. Overfishing and large-scale declines are also likely occurring elsewhere in its range.<br/><br/>In addition to fishing, the pervasive removal and/or degradation of mangroves across its range is a major threat to juvenile survival. Other threats also include reduced genetic diversity, health stresses caused by high mercury concentrations and localised recruitment failures caused by extreme red tide and cold water events given the nearshore and shallow depths often occupied by this species.<br/><br/>Outside of U.S. waters, conservation measures are not sufficient to allow recovery or to prevent continued declines. Even though official historical quantitative records are poor to non-existent, it is clear from multiple well-documented anecdotal observations that a rapid decline occurred over at least the past 50 years as fishing intensity increased and as mangroves declined over the 1970s to 1990s. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the early 1950s, which covers a time period of about three generation lengths (at least 64.5 years), and is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd.<br/><br/>Improvements in fisheries monitoring and management are needed outside U.S waters, and the closure of the U.S. fishery should remain in place, especially since we suspect that at least an 80% population reduction could occur within the next three generations should the current management be removed. Spawning aggregation sites and mangrove preservation/restoration should be priorities for conservation. The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","Adults are most often associated with offshore rocky reefs, wrecks, artificial reefs and oil platforms. It can occur in coral reef habitat, but is much more abundant on rocky reef (Collins 2009; Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011; Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014a,c; Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mangroves are the primary juvenile habitat (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007); juveniles are also occasionally observed on adjacent inshore structured habitats, such as seagrass, tide pools, shallow rocky areas, jetties and docks (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992; Sadovy and Eklund 1999; Gerber <em>et al</em>. 2005; Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b; Lobato <em>et al</em>. 2016), but return to 'home' sites in nearby mangroves at low tide (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Juvenile distribution in mangroves depends on local water quality, particularly dissolved oxygen content (&gt;4 ppm) and mid-range salinities (&gt;10 ppt; Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007). Within the mangrove system, undercuts and sites with high structural complexity are particularly favoured by juveniles (Frias-Torres 2006). Individuals spend their first 5-6 years in this habitat and reach a meter in length and about 50 lbs in weight as juveniles and are extremely site-specific (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Juveniles move from nearshore shallow habitats at a total length of about one meter to take up residence on offshore reefs (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, Collins <em>et al.</em> 2015). In French Guiana, the population of this species is comprised primarily of juveniles that utilize rocky habitats on the windward sides of offshore islands due to the ephemeral nature of the Amazonian-influenced mangroves (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b). Large juveniles and adults on offshore structure display strong site fidelity but move from home sites to spawning aggregation sites during July (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015) and remain on spawning sites until mid-October. This species primarily consumes fish, crabs and crustaceans (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Koenig and Coleman 2009, Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2015, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Maximum total length is 250 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993).<br/><br/>In the southeastern U.S., spawning aggregations occur at the same localities in relatively shallow (10-50 m) water from August through mid-October (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2002, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2016, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Adults have been observed to migrate up to 500 km to spawning sites (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2013). It often spawns near wrecks (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2015), but also uses natural sites which it often excavates (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011). Aggregations are relatively small, usually with fewer than 150 individuals, and there is no evidence that spawning occurs outside of aggregations (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Aggregations have been detected during the austral summer (December to March), with peaks in January and February in shallow waters (&lt;30 m depth) in at least seven Brazilian states (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016, Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2016). Many spawning aggregation sites have been identified in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf (Mann <em>et al</em>. 2009, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2016), and one has recently been documented in southern Brazil as well (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>This species may have a reproductive strategy of diandric protogyny (Koenig and Coleman 2016), but functional hermaphroditism has not yet been confirmed. The total length at first maturation for females was estimated at 105.6 cm and 100% of individuals are mature at 126 cm and age at first maturity is about six (Sadovy and Eklund 1999) or seven years (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Growth rates for male and female are similar, averaging &gt;10 cm per year through age six, then slowing to about three cm per year by age 15, and finally declining to less than one cm per year after age 25 (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992). From individuals sampled between 1977-1990 in the Gulf of Mexico, Bullock <em>et al</em>. (1992) recorded that 46% were ≤12 years old, ~78% were ≤ 18 years old, and ~22% of the fish were relatively old (&gt;18 years, up to a maximum age of 37 years). However, it is very likely that this species reaches older ages than 37 years since the specimens from Bullock <em>et al</em>. (1992) were collected after this species was already historically overfished and other comparable grouper species are known to reach ages older than this (e.g., <em>Hyporthodus flavolimbatus</em> to 85 years and <em>Mycteroperca interstitialis</em> to 41 years; SEDAR47 2016). Individuals sampled from 2011 to 2015 on the east coast of Florida, were still ≤12 years old (85%), with 99% of the fish ≤18 years of age. In Brazil, the maximum observed age was 33 years, but most of analysed specimens did not reach 25 years (B.P. Ferreira pers. comm. 2016). In French Guiana, individuals ranged from 1 to 17 years of age, which indicated that the population is probably composed mostly of juveniles (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Natural mortality is 0.18 (SEDAR47 2016), which is supported by estimates of natural mortality through recapture rates (Koenig and Coleman 2016). Further studies on age, growth and reproduction are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Based on a longevity of 37 years, age of first maturity of 6 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 21.5 years.","<p>Overfishing is a major threat to this species, and its susceptibility to rapid population decline is increased due to heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations (Bullock <em>et al</em>. 1992, Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Mangrove coverage, which is responsible for biomass production of this species, has been reduced by at least a third since the 1970s to 1990s, and much more of the habitat is unsuitable as juvenile habitat because of anthropogenic impacts (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Valiela <em>et al</em>. 2001, Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2007, C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Multiple cohorts were affected by a cold temperature event in 2010, which caused a die-off of juveniles in the Everglades National Park, Florida (Hallac <em>et al</em>. 2010). Juveniles have also been impacted by past severe red tide events on the West Florida Shelf (SEDAR47 2016). A study conducted in Florida reported that mean mercury concentrations in individuals of this species were within the range known to cause direct health effects in fish after long-term exposure, and concluded this could cause stress on their populations (Adams and Sonne 2013, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Another study conducted off Belize also found elevated levels of mercury (Evers <em>et al</em>. 2009). Ongoing research on the impacts from high mercury concentrations indicate that older males in particular suffer liver damage and/or mortality, and that egg viability is reduced (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Another potential threat to the recovering population is inbreeding, and related genetics studies are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/></p>","This species has undergone a severe population decline throughout its entire range and is now rare where it was formerly abundant due to overfishing (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). In most areas, there has been no indication of population recovery. Unfortunately, there are very few historical data sets that are available to gauge population sizes prior to widespread exploitation (beginning around the 1950s) to serve as a reference for the degree of decline in population sizes. As of the writing of this assessment, the southeastern U.S. is the only area in which an appreciable increase in the population of this species has occurred, this following a moratorium on catch in 1990 (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). This is also the only area where reasonably accurate historical landings and effort data are available, and the only area in which a quantitative stock assessment analysis has been completed (SEDAR 47 2016). Even though official historical quantitative records are poor to non-existent, it is clear from well-documented anecdotal observations that a rapid decline occurred over at least the past 50 years as fishing intensity increased and as mangroves declined over the 1970s to 1990s. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the early 1950s, which covers a time period of about three generation lengths (at least 64.5 years).<br/><br/>There is empirical evidence that the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic populations should be treated as one unit. Craig <em>et al</em>. (2009) found that genetic differentiation occurs between Belize and southwest Florida, and Brazil and Florida. Population genetics studies are currently underway in Florida, and preliminary results indicate that inbreeding is likely due to the moderately low genetically effective population size, which is further evidence for a population crash (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>United States:&#160; </strong>Based on historical catches by state, the highest abundance of this species in U.S. waters is in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and its historical centre of abundance has been in the Ten Thousand Islands of southwest Florida (Sadovy and Eklund 1999). This species has been targeted by fishers in U.S. waters since colonial times (late 1800s) and fishing mortality was excessively exceeded from 1963-1989, which resulted in severe population declines. In the 1950s and 1960s, this species was common off southern Florida, but by the 1970s and 1980s, the population had been severely depleted to the point that fishers were forced to travel offshore and target spawning aggregations to sustain catch (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Overall, the steepest period of decline in this species is estimated to have begun in the 1950s and extended at least through the early 1990s, which is a 41-year period (1.9 generations), and during this time, the population declined by nearly 84%. This rapid decline in numbers reflects not only a trend in greater harvest, but also intrinsic biological characteristics which make this species particularly vulnerable to over harvest. These characteristics are primarily reflected in their aggregate spawning behaviour (in which several hundred individuals gather in a predicable place and time), which can lead to hyperstability of populations (SEDAR47 2016). Adults were generally uncommon to rare in the mid 1990s, but the population has been recovering upon the implementation of a fishing moratorium in 1990 and continues to the present. The juvenile abundance index in southwest Florida substantially declined during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has been steadily increasing since the 1990 moratorium until at least 2006 (Cass-Calay and Schmidt 2009). Abundance increased in the mid-1990s directly offshore of the high-quality mangrove nursery of the Ten Thousand Islands and then continued to expand north and south, eventually increasing off Florida’s central east coast as well until at least 2007 (Koenig <em>et al</em>. 2011, SEDAR47 2016). Abundance declined after 2007 until 2011, and despite some upward trends, abundance remains low overall. A severe red tide event on the West Florida shelf in 2005 and cold-kills in 2008 and 2010 in South Florida estuaries are thought to be the drivers of these declines (SEDAR47 2016). Porch <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated there was a 90-100% chance for a 50% population recovery by 2006-2011. Fisher compliance to the moratorium, however, was found to be lower than 90%, which led to a prediction of less than a 40% chance that the population would recover to the 50% population recovery benchmark by 2020 (Porch <em>et al</em>. 2006). Under the moratorium, the estimated relative biomass increased from 0.22 to 0.72 from 1993-2003 and it was categorized as overfished in south Florida in SEDAR6 (2004), but the authors could not determine if overfishing was still occurring due to the lack of data. Considering its high vulnerability to overfishing, a continuation of the moratorium was recommended until further research could determine a complete rebuilding to the target biomass (SEDAR6 2004). From 1993 to 2010 (17 years), relative abundance increased by about five fold, but its overfished status in the South Atlantic could not be determined due to the lack of natural mortality parameters and reliable estimates of moratorium effectiveness (SEDAR 2011). The most recent spawning stock biomass models suggest it is no longer overfished nor experiencing overfishing (SEDAR47 2016); however, the population continues to be skewed towards younger fish 26 years after closure, and will require more time to rebuild the older age classes (Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Stock assessments conducted by the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) have been repeatedly rejected under peer review because of poor historical records and the resulting inability to determine population recovery in terms of size and geographical extent. Despite the large degree of uncertainty in the historical data upon which the most recent stock assessment, SEDAR47 (2016), is based, it is the only available stock assessment with which historical trends in abundance may be gauged. And, while we acknowledge the large degree of uncertainty in this analysis, we posit that the overall trends in the magnitudes of changes are likely to be real even though the absolute values may change with improved historical input data. It is also important to note that the values presented below are based on computer simulations (models) and do not represent direct counts of individuals. We caution that the absolute numbers cited below be interpreted with caution. It should also be noted that this analysis is only for the population of this species in the southeastern U.S. SEDAR 47 (2016) utilized a stock assessment model to hind cast various metrics of abundance to the year 1950. That analysis showed that the average number of individuals among model iterations in 1950 was 513,072 in the southeast U.S.&#160; This number remained relatively constant until about 1975, when it declined from a mean of 378,164 individuals in 1975 to a mean of 82,900 individuals in 1991, which represents about an 80% decline over 16 years. After 1991, the number of individuals increased to a high of 1,186,100 in 2006, but declined thereafter until 2011 with a mean number of fish of 298,500, which is a 75% decline over five years.&#160; In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), there was a mean of 345,700 individuals. From 1950 to the historical low (1991), there was an absolute population reduction of about 84% (over 41 years). From the historical low in 1991 to 2014 there has been a population increase of about 86%. Over the entire period modelled from 1950 to 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis) there has been an absolute population reduction of about 33%. The increases in the numbers of individuals were largely driven by an increase in age-0 fish (which cannot reproduce). During the period 1950-2014, age-0 Atlantic goliath grouper represented 50-85% of the entire population. In 2014 (the terminal year of the analysis), the percentage of age-0 fish was 69%.&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Cuba, Mexico and Belize:&#160; </strong>No fishery assessments have been conducted for this species in the southern Gulf of Mexico and Mexican fishery statistics do not include fishing effort (CONAPESCA). In Mexico, exploitation is unregulated and its population status is poorly known. Some fishery dependent data indicate declining catch trends of this species (Salas <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fisher interviews and records from fishing cooperatives off the northern Yucatan indicate that catch has severely declined over about the past 35 years (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In Cuba, lobster fishermen frequently captured this grouper species (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Although national statistics are not available, population declines observed in Cuba are at least similar to those observed in Mexico. In Belize, it is considered overfished and undergoing overfishing (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Brazil: </strong>Due to a fishing moratorium for this species in place in Brazil since 2002, catch declined by 70% after 2002, but an average of 393 tons per year were poached between 2003-2011 (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b). For example, in the state of Maranhão, fishermen have illegally caught large numbers of adults in spawning aggregations (M.O. Freitas pers. comm. 2016). In northern Brazil and on the Amazonian coast, catches are reported to continue and poachers have targeted aggregations and the species is openly captured and traded in local markets (B. Bentes pers. comm. 2016). In Santa Catarina, Brazil, at least two aggregation sites were mapped and aggregation size ranged from two to 60 individuals (Gerhardinger <em>et al</em>. 2009), but subsequent dives showed that these aggregations were depleted or had moved (Bueno <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species is relatively rare in offshore oceanic islands (Bertoncini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishers on the Abrolhos Bank noted that the abundance of this species has declined by more than 40% and that poaching continues to occur (Zapelini <em>et al</em>. 2017). Spawning populations in northern Brazil are the main source for the population of juveniles in French Guiana (Artero <em>et al</em>. 2015a and b). During Reef Check underwater surveys conducted in Brazil from 2002-2017 in 12 localities and 114 reef sites, individuals of this species were observed only three times, all inside fully protected areas (Reef Check Brazil unpub. data); however, this species can occur recurrently in some very predictable places, particularly shipwrecks. Poaching occurs at these sites despite the protected status of this species in Brazil (B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong>West Africa: </strong>This species is common in shallow waters along mangrove swamps and river mouths near the rivers of Zaire, Ogoué, Cameroon and tributaries as well as near offshore oil platforms of Cabinda and Gabon (Port Gentil), where it is captured by local artisanal fisheries. It is apparently rare in the Gulf of Guinea islands; one specimen was speared in Sao Tomé in 2009 and two juveniles were observed in 2015 (J. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016). Two specimens were taken via spear in Benguela, southern Angola in 2011 (J. de Sousa pers. comm. 2016). One <em>ca</em> 250 kg specimen was observed in a fish market in Libreville, Gabon in 2015 (J. Barreiros pers. comm. 2016).<span lang=""EN-US"">",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the Atlantic Ocean in the west from northeastern Florida, south along the U.S., throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Santa Catarina, Brazil (Hostim-Silva et al. 2005) and in the east along West Africa from Senegal to Cabinda, Angola (Friedlander <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wirtz <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/></p>","<p>This species is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers throughout its range.

The SEDAR47 stock assessment analysis shows that the population can decline by nearly 85% in just 1.9 generations in the absence of this management effort, and therefore, it is highly recommended that this moratorium remain in place (Ferreira <em>et al</em>. 2012, Frias-Torres 2012, Koenig and Coleman 2016).<br/><br/>Conservation measures for this species off Mexico are insufficient and improvement in regional and international management, including a formal stock assessment, are needed (Aguilar-Perera <em>et al</em>. 2009). Under direction of the IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency), this species has been fully protected in Brazil since 2002. This reduced fishing effort, but did not eliminate it due to insufficient enforcement against poaching (Giglio <em>et al</em>. 2014b, B. Padovani-Ferreira and Athila Bertoncini pers. comm. 2018). The inter-Ministry ordinance No.13 of 2015 granted protection for this species until 2023 in Brazilian waters. Spawning aggregation sites should be a priority for conservation. This species has been recorded in several marine protected areas, including the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hickerson <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Parque Nacional Guanahacabibes in western Cuba (R. Claro pers. comm. 2014). Research is currently underway on adult and juvenile habitat preference, size, age, movement, aggregation location and behaviour and feeding ecology in U.S. waters. Further research is needed on the genetics and age structure of the offshore portion of the U.S. population to improve stock assessment models (SEDAR47 2016).","",,false,false,Global

It occurs on the southern Brazilian slope where deep-water trawling has been intense, with some vessels fishing at depths of over 1,100 m by the mid-2000s (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009).

It is an important component of flounder fisheries in Japan and Korea and is retained as bycatch in Russian waters. In Chinese waters, it also likely contributes to the flounder catches, though no specific data are available to monitor changes in abundance. The population structure across this species' range remains poorly understood, but it is considered to have a naturally low abundance in Russian waters, parts of the Sea of Japan, and in the eastern Pacific (from Alaska to California, where relatively few captures have been recorded). Since it is considered common and abundant in Korean waters and off the northern Pacific coast of Japan, the largest proportion of its global population (for the purposes of this Red List assessment) is inferred to occur in these areas.&#160;According to scientific survey data collected since the late 1970s, catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species in Russian waters has been stable with no noticeable trend. On the Pacific coast of the Tohoku area of Japan, CPUE declined by about 62% over the past three generations (since about 1983) and the stock remains at a low level compared to those observed in the 1970s and early 1980s. A recovery plan is in place and CPUE has been gradually increasing over the past one and half generations (since about 2000). Data are not available for this species in South Korea, but catches of the flounder fisheries that take this species have been in decline since the 1970s, and demand has increased; as such, it is likely that the abundance of this species has declined in South Korean waters. Based on data from the western Pacific, where the majority of its global population occurs, it is suspected that this species has undergone a global-level decline of 30-50% over the past three generations due to overfishing; therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bd.

Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e.&#160;<em>Pleuronichthys </em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2012).

It is exploited by commercial fisheries in most of its range. It is a relatively low-value flatfish species in Russia, but is targeted by flatfish fisheries conducted off South Korea, in the southwestern Sea of Japan, and in the East China and Yellow seas. Over the past three generations (since 2002), catch per unit effort in the southwestern Sea of Japan declined by 43% and spawning stock biomass declined by 62%.

Based on these data, and inferring that 80% of the global population occurs in the western Sea of Japan, Korean waters, and the East China Sea, it is inferred that this species has undergone a global-level decline of 30-50% over the past three generations. It is further inferred that this decline is expected to continue due to the lack of effective fishery management in large parts of its range where it is heavily exploited. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable A2bd. A multi-national cooperative approach to managing East China Sea fishery resources is urgently needed.&#160;<br/><span style=""""><br/></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</span>","This demersal species occurs on sand and mud bottoms on the continental shelf and slope.

The generation length, based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods, 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, is estimated to be about 6 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to the majority of the global population of this species (i.e. off China, Korea, and in western Sea of Japan).","<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><strong>Russia: </strong>This species is considered common off some parts of southern Russia (Parin&#160;</span><em>et al.&#160;</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">2014), but has apparently become rare over time off Primorye. The cause of this decline is thought to be a climatic shift that occurred there since the 1980s, and not overfishing, as fishing effort has been relatively low (Antonenko 2007). </span>According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), this species was captured 25 times in the years 1982, 1997, and 2000 (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><br/><br/><strong>Japan:</strong>&#160;This species has a wide distribution in Japanese waters of the Sea of Japan (from Aomori to Tsushima), but is most abundant off the prefectures of Yamaguchi and Shimane, located in the southwestern part of the sea (Yagi <em>et al.</em> 2019). It is common and abundant i</span>n Japanese waters in the Tsushima Strait, Sea of Japan. Trawl fisheries that target flatfishes in this area take this species, as well as <em>Cleisthenes pinetorum</em> and <em>Glyptocephalus kitaharae </em>(Imai 2016). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the southwestern Sea of Japan starting in 1966, peaked in 1978, steeply declined to a low in 1988, increased with some fluctuation to 2009, and has been declining since then. The spawning stock biomass has been below the sustainability limit (B<sub>LIM</sub>) since 2004 and has had a declining trend since 2008. Over the past three generations (since 2002), standardized CPUE declined by 43% and spawning stock biomass declined by 62%. Recruitment had a declining trend from 2007 to 2016 but has been increasing since then. The frequent capture of immature individuals is likely a contributor to this decline. The stock is at a low level as compared to that of the 1970s and the trend is not expected to increase in the near future even though fishing effort has been steadily declining since peaking in the early 1980s (Yagi <em>et al.</em> 2019). Declines are thought to be caused, at least in part, by changes&#160;in water temperature in this area, because recruitment of this species is best in warm water years (Imai 2016). For example, the abundance of this species increased and expanded in this area during the warm water years of the 1990s (Tian <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><span style="""">Based on increasing trends in catch and CPUE, it is inferred that this species has increased over the last two decades on the Pacific coast of northern Japan; although, a stock assessment has not been conducted for this subpopulation (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021). Catches drastically increased from 2000-2007 (around 10 tons) to 2008-2009 (53.9-62.5 t; Chiyokubo 2010). In 2010, the catch was 32 t (Fukushima Prefecture unpublished data 2019). After the tsunami disaster in 2011, fishery effort drastically decreased, but the catch of this species was 28 and 41 t in 2016 and 2017, respectively (Fukushima Prefecture unpublished data 2019). CPUE drastically increased from 2000-2007 to 2008, especially in trawl vessels operating at southern area off Fukushima Prefecture (Chiyokubo 2010). CPUE data are not available since the 2011 disaster; however, considering the reduction of fishing effort in recent years and increasing catch, it is likely that CPUE also increased after 2011 (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;Also, the stock in the northern Sea of Japan off Aomori Prefecture increased from 2000 to 2012 (Ito <em style="""">et al</em>. 2015). Annual catches in the western Sea of Japan are larger compared to those off Aomori (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;<br/></span><br/>This species is also caught in the multi-species bottom trawl fishery that operates in the East China Sea on the continental shelf west of Kyushu. Fishing vessels from China, Japan, and South Korea exploit the same fishing grounds, with those from China and South Korea currently taking a large majority of the total catches compared to those of Japan. Vessels from China take a larger proportion of the catches relative to those from South Korea. Catches in this fishery steeply declined in the early 1970s and has continued a gradual decline since then. Since the 1960s, total bottom trawl fishery annual catch has declined by over 95%. Catches of flatfishes in this multispecies fishery declined by 99% since the early 1980s with the time series low reached in 2018. Over the past three generations (since 2002), catches declined by 50% or more. Japanese fishing effort declined significantly over time. Quantified data on Chinese fishing effort are limited, but overexploitation by Chinese and South Korean fisheries continues. Catches by China and South Korea have not increased significantly since the 1990s. Currently, there are nine fish species targeted by this fishery, including <em>Eopsetta grigorjewi</em>, and all species are considered to be at a low stock level due to overexploitation driven mostly by high pressure from Chinese fisheries. The stock index of flatfishes declined steeply in the late 1990s, and has continued a gradual decline since then.

Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b).

For example, estuaries in Japan have been reduced due to land reclamation activities and the habitat quality has declined due to pollution. In Chinese waters, marine pollution and degradation of spawning habitats have been indicated as having negative impacts on other pleuronectids found in these areas (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Across the global population of this species, the largest proportion occurs in northern Japan (T.

According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), this species was only captured 17 times and primarily in the waters within the vicinity of Vladivostok in the Sea of Japan. According to the literature, the presence of this species is confirmed in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific coast of Russia, but has not been recorded in the survey work that is regularly conducted in those areas; however, these surveys do not extend in to the shallow, nearshore areas where this species occurs (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2021).<br/><br/><strong>Korea</strong>: There has been a significant decline in the stock of this species in Korean waters since at least the early 2000s due to overfishing (Jun&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006, 2018). Korean flatfish fisheries have been overfished since at least the 1980s (Yoon <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: Species-specific population data are limited for this species in China. In Chinese coastal waters, overfishing of the flatfish stocks has occurred at least since the 1980s (Dagang <em>et al.</em> 1992, Tian <em>et al. </em>2008). Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted species of <em>Pleuronichthys</em>, which are also in the family Pleuronectidae, in Chinese waters (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Overfishing in the East China Sea, which is primarily driven by Chinese fishing fleets, has caused steep declines in flatfish stocks since the late 1990s (Aonuma <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Japan</strong>: This species is common in Japan and is known to hybridize with&#160;<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>&#160;in Japanese coastal waters (Yamashita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, 2018). In the Seto Inland Sea, this species is primarily caught in Yamaguchi, Oita and Fukuoka prefectures. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, catch per unit effort (CPUE) steeply declined from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, continued a gradual decline through the late 1990s to 2010, and has remained flat at a very low level since 2011. Since 1998, CPUE declined by about 80% and the stock is at a critically low level with continuing decline. The stock in Fukuoka Prefecture is also at a critically low level, and since 2005, CPUE declined by about 70%. In Oita Prefecture, CPUE has had a declining trend since the late 1990s, and since 1998, CPUE declined by about 94%. The stock is currently considered to be at a low level (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>In Tokyo Bay, it was heavily exploited in the 1970s and subsequently declined in the 1980s and 1990s (Uehara and Shimizu 1996, 1999). Catch of this species greatly declined in Sendai Bay on the northern Pacific coast between the early 1970s and 1995 (Yamashita<em> et al</em>. 2000). Population data are limited for the Hokkaido stock, but a declining trend is not suspected at this time (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;In the Tohoku region on the northern Pacific coast, this species is primarily captured in the prefectures of Fukushima and Ibaraki, with a lower level of catch in Miyagi Prefecture. The largest abundance is likely occurring off Fukushima.&#160;From 2006 to 2011, total catch declined, and after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, fishing was further restricted from 2012 to 2015. This negatively impacted the availability of stock status data. In Fukushima Prefecture, CPUE data are available beginning in 2005 (two past generations). CPUE in 2019 was slightly higher than in 2005 and the stock level has been stable over the past five years (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019). In Miyagi Prefecture, CPUE trends have also been stable (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, unpublished data indicates a declining stock trend in recent years mainly off Miyagi and Fukushima (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;In Ibaraki Prefecture, CPUE increased significantly from the late 1990s to the late 2000s but has had a declining trend since then. From 2005, CPUE declined by about 95%. Recruitment has been low in Ibaraki Prefecture and the current stock level is low (Tohoku National Fisheries Research Institute 2019).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western North Pacific Ocean.

The estimated generation length is six years. Historically, this species was considered widely distributed along both coasts of northern Japan, in the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and off the Kuril Islands but it is now considered rare with its center of abundance concentrated off the east coast of Hokkaido to Tohoku. The stock off northeastern Japan has declined by 80% and possibly more since 1975, or over the past 45 years; this equates to a decline of about 47% over the past three generations (18 years). A stock enhancement programme that releases large numbers of hatchery-raised individuals into the wild off northern Japan has been successful in causing commercial landings to increase, but catches of wild-born fish in this area have remained comparably low, and recovery of the wild population is not yet evidenced. Following the Red List guidelines, only the wild population is considered when estimating population decline. Species-specific data from Chinese and Korean waters are unavailable. However, large-scale demersal trawl fisheries are active in these areas and declines in flatfish catches have been documented. In addition to overfishing, this species is likely negatively impacted by coastal development and pollution in shallow, nearshore and estuarine habitats. Based on these data, and inferring that only a small proportion of its global population occurs in Russian waters where it is naturally rare, it is conservatively inferred that this species has undergone a 30-50% global-level decline over the past three generations, and therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd. Due to the lack of species-specific quantified data for much of the distribution, the confidence in a suspected global decline of greater than 50% was low, and therefore, a category of Endangered or Critically Endangered was not supported. Future investigations may reveal a higher global decline than is currently inferred based on the available data, which would necessitate a reassessment. Stronger fisheries management measures are needed to improve the status of this species throughout most of its range. Additionally, the impacts of anthropogenic changes on habitats in which this species occurs and those related to the introduction of large numbers of hatchery-raised juveniles on the wild population require further quantification and monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/></span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.</span>","This demersal species occurs on sand and mud bottoms in estuarine and coastal waters on the continental shelf to the upper continental slope. The maximum standard length is 70 cm (Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al.</em> 2014). It conducts relatively long distance, seasonal migrations between feeding grounds in coastal areas and spawning grounds located on the continental slope around 300 m depth (Kawabe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Spawning occurs from February to April&#160;(Kawabe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Recruitment success is variable, and is higher in times of favorable water temperature (Kawabe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Some males attain first maturity at 34 cm total length and 2 years, while some females attain first maturity at 45 cm and 3 years (Yoshida<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2008). However, 50% maturity in females occurs at 53 cm total length and 4 years (Kayaba&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Longevity in males and females is estimated to be 8 years, and based on these data, the natural mortality is estimated to be 0.31 for both males and females (Hokkaido Research Organization 2020). Generation length, 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, is estimated to be about 6 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species. As this species occurs in nearshore and estuarine environments, habitat degradation in these sensitive areas may negatively impact its population.","<strong>Russia</strong>: This species is naturally rare in Russian waters (Parin <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Japan</strong>:&#160;<span style="""">Ortega-Villaizán Romo <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted that the fisheries for this species in Japanese waters was declared to be in danger, as the annual fishery yield from natural resources has decreased since 1975 (Sasaki 1997). The distribution in Japanese waters has become more restricted with the decline in the stock (Ortega-Villaizán Romo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;Historically, this species was considered widely distributed along both coasts of northern Japan, in the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and off the Kuril Islands (Masuda <em>et al</em>. 1984), but it is now considered rare with its centre of abundance concentrated off the east coast of Hokkaido to Tohoku (Minami 1994).&#160;</span><br/><br/>Data are limited on the status of this species in the Sea of Japan south of Hokkaido, likely due in part to such low abundances that commercial landings are negligible. Commercial catches of this species in Hokkaido and Tohoku steeply declined after the late 1970s and remained extremely low through the 1980s and 1990s onwards. This decline was caused by overfishing, especially the frequent capture of immature individuals. To aid in stock recovery, a stock enhancement programme that releases hatchery-raised individuals to the wild was initiated in 1987. In 2006, this programme was expanded to a large-scale operation releasing &gt;1 million fish. Commercial landings have been increasing since 2006 as a direct result of this programme, but 90% or more of these landings are composed of the hatchery-released individuals, indicating the natural, wild stock remains at a low level with low reproductive and/or recruitment success. Few wild individuals have even been caught in Hokkaido waters, where historically it was once common (Wada <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kayaba <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, wild juveniles have been observed recently in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and wild fish have been recorded in the fishery landings (Hokkaido Research Organization 2020). Hokkaido Prefecture has conducted stock assessments for this species. Although the Hokkaido Research Organization (2020) regarded the stock status in 2019 to be at a medium level based on the annual catch of this species, this does not accurately reflect the status of the wild stock, as the majority of landed fish were hatchery-raised individuals.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Korea and China</strong>: Data are limited on the status of this species in Chinese and Korean waters; although, large-scale demersal trawl fisheries are active in these areas and declines are suspected to be likely, as fishing effort has increased significantly over time. Effort data for the Korean flounder fisheries are not consistently collected, but catches have been trending downwards since the late 1970s (Chae and Pascoe 2005).&#160;In Chinese coastal waters, overfishing of the flatfish stocks has occurred at least since the 1980s (Dagang <em>et al</em>. 1992, Tian <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e., <em>Pleuronichthys </em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu <em>et al. </em>2012). <span style="""">Although&#160;species-specific data for Barfin Flounder are lacking for stocks in Chinese and Korean waters, declines&#160;in abundance&#160;in similar flatfish species have been documented there, and it is suspected that Barfin Flounder is among the flatfishes undergoing these declines.</span>",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western North Pacific from the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula, Peter the Great Bay, the Primorye coast to Chikhacheva Bay, southwestern Sakhalin Island, and Japan (Hokkaido to Hamada in Shimane Prefecture); in the southern Sea of Okhotsk from Aniva Bay north to Chaivo Bay off Sakhalin and the southern Kuril Islands; and off Pacific Japan from Hokkaido to Ibaraki Prefecture (Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al.</em> 2014, Amaoka 2016).

As long as the genetic diversity of the hatchery-reared fish is not constrained, this could have a positive impact on the wild population. However, if the genetic diversity of the hatchery-reared fish is constrained, then this interbreeding could potentially have a negative impact by reducing the genetic diversity of the wild stock. Further work is needed to determine the impacts of large-scale releases of hatchery-reared individuals on the wild population.&#160;<br/><br/>There is a closed season for trawl fishing off northeastern Japan and gear restrictions, but additional measures are needed to protect spawning individuals (Kayaba&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).","",,false,false,Global

According to landings and catch per unit effort data, the population in Brazil is overexploited and declined by at least 30-60% over the past three generation lengths, or about a 30-year time period. According to stock assessment and fisheries data, there is no decline detected in the demersal fish stock in Argentina and Uruguay and abundance indices show an increase in recent years (since 2014). Fishing effort continues at an unsustainable level in Brazil, the fishery is not well-monitored and conservation measures are insufficient. Conservation measures in Argentina and Uruguay include a total allowable catch limit and regular monitoring of stock status. In addition to fishing, this species is exposed to pollution in estuaries that may be impacting the survivability of some individuals. Based on declines in half of its global population (Brazil), at least a 30% global-level decline is suspected to have occurred over the past three generation lengths; therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bcd. It is recommended to improve fisheries monitoring, including the collection of species-specific data, as well as implement conservation measures to reduce effort in Brazilian fisheries.","This marine, demersal species can be mainly found on sandy substrates on the continental shelf, and can occur in the lower parts of estuaries as well (Díaz de Astarloa and Munroe 1998).

The common demersal fishing area, which is where the fishery that targets flatfishes and other demersal fishes operates, includes Uruguay and northern Argentina, with the highest catch occurring off Buenos Aires and declining to the south. Flatfish species represent only 6% of this catch and some vessels changed the target species towards the south to target prawn, so effort declined in recent years. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 1999 to 2018 was very variable. Biomass estimates from 1934 to 2018 show somewhat of a decline, but this is highly uncertain as the indices of abundance trend upward since about 2014 or over the past 4-5 years. Data from recent research cruises are expected to improve these model indices. According to the most recent stock assessment of the demersal fishery, it is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.

The catch data showed a 98% decline in landings over the 65 years (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014.

In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a><a name=""_Hlk22884618"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters.

In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). </a></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk29382493"">The Yellow-spotted Fanray is considered abundant in Taiwan (Hsieh 2011), and relatively common in China, where there has been no change in the observed abundance of this species at landing sites over the past 15 years (J.

In Japan, this species has reported to have declined in abundance in the East China Sea but was still common in 2009 in southern Japan (Izu Peninsula) (Ishihara <em>et al.</em> 2009).</a></p>      <p>Despite the lack of species-specific data, in Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953–2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. <br/> </p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010–2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).  <p>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969–2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950–1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk24453985"">There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al. </em>2013).</a></p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Yellow-spotted Fanray (23.3 years in Japan and the Koreas, and 36 years in Taiwan, China, and Viet Nam), they represent declines of 70%, 81%, 46%, 83%, and 96% in Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. </p>  <p>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Yellow-spotted Fanray. Yet, it is still considered abundant in Taiwan and relatively common in parts of its distribution, with stable landing rates reported from China over the past 15 years. This suggests that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. Inshore and seasonal trawl bans in China and Taiwan may afford the species some refuge.

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).</a></p>  <p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>    <p>This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). It may also be protected in parts of China where there are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019a) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019).

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 20–80 m. The species is likely a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is likely retained for human consumption and fish meal. Landings data of all skates combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the Japan and China EEZs indicate declines of 50%, 77 %, and 30 % respectively, over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Historic and current fishing pressure are high across the species’ entire range, yet it is appears to have a fairly stable population in northeast Taiwan over the past 31 years which indicates that the species likely has some resilience to fishing pressure. Dramatic levels of habitat loss across its China range are also likely a threat to the species. Overall, the majority of the species distribution is across China and Taiwan. It is inferred that the Polkadot Skate has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd. </p>","The Polkadot Skate is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 20–80 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 68 cm total length; male and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is presumably oviparous, like other skates (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the similar-sized White-spotted Skate (<em>Dipturus cerva</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 5 years and a maximum age of 9 years, resulting in a generation length of 7 years (Treloar 2008).","<p>The Polkadot Skate is likely subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is probably taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, set net, and gillnet, and retained for human consumption or fish meal.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Polkadot Skate. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22884618"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011).</a> The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Although there is no detailed effort data, the number of trawl vessels operating in the northeast of Taiwan has remained fairly stable from 1999–2008 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort across Taiwan has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara<em> et al. </em>2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s and 65% loss of tidal flats (one type of intertidal habitat) since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al. </em>2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). </a></p>","<p>The Polkadot Skate is not uncommon in Taiwan with little change in the observed landing rates over the past 31 years in the northeast of Taiwan (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer a stable population as landings have remained stable while fishing effort across all depths has remained relatively stable. In Taiwan, landings data are also available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Landings data can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. <br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950<a name=""_Hlk29383809""> </a>to 2014 have been reconstructed for Japan and China EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J.

It occurs in inshore and offshore waters from the surface down to at least 60 m. It has often been confused with the Bull Shark (<em>C. leucas</em>) confounding information on distribution and abundance. It matures late and has a biennial reproductive cycle resulting in low productivity. The species is taken as bycatch by multiple gears, including gillnet and longline, throughout its range. In Australian waters, it is taken only in limited amounts, however, in the remainder of its range it is subject to intensive coastal fisheries that have operated over many decades. No species-specific information on population decline is available, but there is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae spp.) across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 73% reduction in the Pigeye Shark over the past three generation lengths (65 years). The Pigeye Shark’s low productivity mean that it is likely to have declined through most of its range, however, it is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range. It is suspected that the Pigeye Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (65 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Pigeye Shark occurs in inshore and offshore waters to a depth of at least 60 m; juveniles are known to occur in the outer part of estuaries (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). It occurs throughout the water column but is predominantly demersal (Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 280 cm total length (TL) (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016), though it has been reported to 303 cm TL in Oman (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Males mature at 195–227 cm TL and females mature at 195–224 cm TL (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk sac placenta and litter sizes of 3–13 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 48–72 cm TL (Bass <em>et al</em>. 1973, Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Age parameters are available from Australia, where female age-at-maturity is 13 years and maximum age is at least 30 years, resulting in a generation length of 21.5 years (Tillett <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The Pigeye Shark is taken in coastal waters throughout its range as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by a variety of fishing gears, including gillnet, longline, trawl, and handline. Its large size makes it a frequently retained species due to the value of its fins and meat. The meat is prized in some markets and attracts a price premium. Data for the species is particularly sparse because of its similarity in appearance to the Bull Shark which has a similar size and an overlapping distribution. <br/><br/>In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. For example, Harry et al. (2011) reported that it made up 1.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality well below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>The species is caught throughout the coastal waters of Southeast Asia. However, in recent years its occurrence in landings has decreased in a number of nations. For example, Winter <em>et al</em>. (2020) did not report it in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9-month period from 2017 to 2018. Similarly, in Thailand it has not been observed in recent surveys (Arunrugstichai et al. 2018). However, in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka it continues to occur in landings (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2019, D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, the high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye <em>et al</em>. 2007). While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licences issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting shark populations (Glaser <em>et al</em>. 2015). In India, there are over 13,400 gillnetters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating. In Pakistan, the Pigeye Shark was targeted in commercial fisheries along with the Bull Shark, but by 2001, these fisheries had ceased (M. Khan pers. comm. 14 January 2021)<br/><br/>The Pigeye Shark is taken in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). This species’ presence in mangrove habitats means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in parts of its range. For e.g., across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Species-specific population data are not available in most of its range. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>C. sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% decline when scaled to three generation lengths of the Pigeye Shark (65 years). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, this species is still caught in many nations. In Indonesia, it is reported, but is often confused with the Bull Shark (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Malaysia, it is still caught occasionally in Sarawak, but has been absent from recent surveys on Peninsular Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Myanmar, it is still occasionally caught, but in much lower numbers than historically (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Bangladesh, it is one of the more common shark species landed (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2019), but there is evidence that abundance has declined (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, adults are most commonly caught, with many pregnant females reported (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Throughout the Arabian Seas, it is commonly confused with the Bull Shark, making landings records and trends difficult to interpret. This species was only relatively recently confirmed from the Saudi Red Sea (Spaet <em>et al</em>. 2011) and represented less than 1% of elasmobranch landings by number (Spaet and Berumen 2015). It is uncommonly caught in the Red Sea, but is relatively common in the Gulf of Aden (I. Elhassan unpubl. data 2017). In the Gulf, it is variably abundant, representing 2.1% of elasmobranch catches by number in Kuwait and &gt;1% in Qatar and Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up about 1% of shark landings by number (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Oman, it was uncommonly recorded in landing surveys, although it represented 1.8% of sharks traded from Oman to the UAE by number (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is rarely caught in Iran (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). In Pakistan, in 2019 it represented 0.5% of the total shark commercial shark landings and was observed to have declined by ~43% over the past 20 years, despite sustained fishing effort (M. Khan pers. comm. 14 January 2020). In India, Raje <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported landings of 64 t between 2003–2004 from the southwest coast, although it is currently rarely recorded in landings (Akhilesh et al. 2011, K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches. Reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006). Historical surveys in the Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980–81, whereas in 2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In Australia, little data on changes in its abundance are available, although it may have declined in the 1970s and 1980s as the result of intensive foreign gillnet fishing, but this pressure has since eased and other species in the area have recovered to close to their historic abundance levels. Harry <em>et al</em>. (2016) used tag-recapture data from the east coast of Queensland to show that current catch levels were approaching levels that may not be sustainable. However, they did not estimate the level of decline in the population. <br/><br/>While there is limited information available on this species in the region, its size, increasing demand for the fin trade, and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that like many other medium-sized carcharhinids in the region it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the regions LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths (65 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. It is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Pigeye Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (65 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Pigeye Shark is widespread but patchy in the Indo-West Pacific from Australia to South Africa, including the Indo-Malay Archipelago, Southeast Asia, and eastern Africa. It has also been recorded from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau in the Eastern Central Atlantic, but is probably more widespread in the area (Compagno 2016). It is likely to have been widely misidentified as the Bull Shark (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) where their distributions overlap.","Pigeye Sharks are used for their meat and fins (high value in adults) and other products, such as skin, cartilage, and jaws (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, DABAFR 2009). In the Arabian Seas region, meat of juveniles of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets and there is a preference for its meat at local markets; adults are frequently traded whole with their meat cut into small cubes, dried and exported to international markets (one route is from Dubai to Sri Lanka). The fins of this species are utilised in the fin trade, with Fields <em>et al</em>. (2018) reporting that this species accounted for ~0.4% of trimmings in Hong Kong fin markets.",Marine,"There are few species-specific regulations in place to protect this species. In northern Australia, fisheries that target sharks are managed using output (i.e., effort controls) and/or Total Allowable Catches (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory). These catch limits are not species-specific, but are for sharks or subsets of shark species. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) is also mandated and has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large sharks in prawn and shrimp trawls (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2020). Elsewhere, there are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Some countries have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran (from March to August) and the United Arab Emirates (February to June). No-take marine protected areas provide some level of protection for sharks, and are distributed throughout the species' range. However, the benefits that these often small and poorly enforced spatial protections provide is uncertain. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It occurs from the surface down to depths of at least 330 m. The species exhibits moderately slow life history characteristics. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth. and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 250 reefs in 39 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 48.8% over three generation lengths (37 years). Therefore, the Whitetip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (37 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Whitetip Reef Shark is demersal on the continental shelves and around oceanic islands and reefs at depths of 0–330 m (Randall 1977). It is closely associated with coral reefs in clear tropical waters (Compagno 1984). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) but adults are very rare over 160 cm. Size-at-maturity is about 105 cm TL (Randall 1977). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta, small litters of 1–5 (Last and Stevens 2009), an annual reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 52–60 cm TL. Growth is slow in the wild, estimated at 2.1–4.2 cm year<sup>-1</sup> (Randall 1977), and they may attain sexual maturity at eight to nine years and live to about 16 years (Randall 1977, Smith <em>et al.</em> 1998). Generation length is estimated to be 12.3 years (Randall 1977).","<p>The Whitetip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al.</em> 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.</p><p>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.&#160;Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.</p><p>&#160;</p>","Genetic studies support multiple subpopulations of Whitetip Reef Sharks, with the clearest separation between the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Whitney<em> et al</em>. 2012). There is also evidence that there is population structure in the Pacific Ocean, possibly drive by isolation by distance (Whitney <em>et al.</em> 2012). For example, samples from the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef showed differentiation. Samples from the Eastern Pacific (Costa Rica) have low genetic diversity (a single mitochondrial haplotype) but are genetically similar to those from the Central Pacific.&#160;<br/><br/>There are numerous reports of declines in reef shark populations throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans (e.g. MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020; Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010), but few specific to Whitetip Reef Sharks. Robbins <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported ongoing collapse on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), with an estimated decline of 80% on reefs with the fewest fishing restrictions based on diver surveys. Later research using baited remote underwater video (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014) and fishing surveys (Heupel <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggest the declines were less dramatic than reported by Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006), and that increases in unfished areas of the GBR had resulted in some recovery. Nadon&#160;<em>et al.</em> (2012), using towed diver surveys, showed that reef shark populations, including Whitetip Reef Sharks, were at carrying capacity on reefs uninhabited by humans, but had declined to very low levels (&lt;3% of carrying capacity) on inhabited islands (e.g. main Hawaiian Islands, Guam). In the areas with large declines, the relative importance of Whitetip Reef Sharks on reefs had increased relative to other reef shark species.&#160;Given the population structure observed in Whitetip Reef Sharks it is difficult to assess the global status of this species from patchy accounts of possible declines in some parts of its range.&#160;<br/><br/>To account for differences in the trajectory of Whitetip Reef Shark subpopulations among locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). This is the largest data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Whitetip Reef Sharks was estimated as 48.8% (standard error 39.8–57.7%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (~37 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded that the Whitetip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in the last 3 generation lengths (~37 years) and is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.",Decreasing,"The Whitetip Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean from western Africa to the Eastern Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Whitney <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<em><br/></em>","The meat of this species is sold fresh, frozen, salted and dried for human consumption at local markets throughout it range.

However, incidental catches frequently occur in artisanal fisheries that are often exempt from these rules. However, there are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species. Marine Protected Areas that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2020). MPAs are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al.</em> 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020).

The species' life history is poorly known, but its biological productivity is assumed to be limited based on closely related species. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and demersal trawls. In some locations it is retained live for the aquarium trade, but in general is of relatively low value and often not retained.&#160;This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Results from baited remote underwater video system surveys of coral reefs across its range (242 reefs in 37 nations) suggest that the species has declined to very low levels through much of its range in Asia and Africa, but remains common in Australia, southern Red Sea and many of the island nations of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Reproductive biology appears to vary regional being aplacental viviparous in Australia with litter sizes of up to 26 pups (maximum of 32 pups) whereas in Japan oophagy is reported with much smaller litter sizes of 1–4 pups (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Size-at-birth of 40–60 cm TL (Teshima <em>et al.</em> 1995, Compagno 2001, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).

There is little species-specific information on catches, and the magnitude of catches is poorly understood, especially in those areas where population reductions have been the greatest. The species is rarely targeted, except for use as an aquarium display species, because its meat and fins are considered of low value. It is often discarded, but is retained in some nations, including India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. In recent years, it has only been rarely observed at fish landing sites in Indonesia where it is caught mostly by demersal longline and coastal gillnet vessels. For example, Winter <em>et al.</em> (2020) reporting it made up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar in 2017–2018. In the Andaman Islands (India) it is caught mostly in the grouper demersal longline fishery, but also occasionally in trawls. In India, this species is caught in line and gillnet fisheries with landings ranged between from 1 to 84 t per year on the west coast for 2010–2015 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, this species is caught incidentally, and the meat is considered to be of low quality and value. This is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide, but this trade is small compared to catches in fisheries.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.

The species rarely reaches high levels of abundance, being relatively uncommon in many parts of its range. Results from a global baited remote underwater video system survey of global coral reefs (FinPrint 2020) deployed 11,254 video units on 242 reefs in 37 nations throughout its geographic range (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). It was not observed in sufficient numbers to estimate levels of population reduction, however, it was found to be regularly observed in Australia, many Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations, and the southern Red Sea&#160; (C. Simpfendorfer unpubl. data 2020). In these areas, its population appears to have remained stable. However, along the continental margins of Asia and Africa this species was rarely observed, suggesting that populations have declined substantially. <br/><br/>The occurrence of this species at Indonesian landing sites has declined over time despite consistent levels of fishing effort, suggesting that the abundance of this species has declined over time (Fahmi, unpubl. data 2020). Similar observations have been reported on the occurrence in the Philippines (J. Utzurrum, unpubl. data 2020) and Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In some nations, recent surveys have failed to locate this species despite extensive efforts and substantial historic records (e.g., Myanmar - A. Maung unpubl data 2020; Bangladesh - A.B.

In a survey of sharks traded from Oman into the United Arab Emirates, this species represented 0.2% of sharks (Jababo <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The interpretation of the level of global population reduction is complicated by the divergent state of this species between island (limited population reduction) and continental margin (large population reductions) portions of its range.

Across these LMEs that encompass the range of the Hooktooth Shark, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased. In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Pauly and Liang 2019, Pauly <em>et al. 2</em>020). The reconstructed catch levels of these combined species grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 140,142 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,415 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 34 years (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This represents a 39% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (24 years) of the Hooktooth Shark. <br/>    </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, reports indicate that shark resources are declining across the species' range. Off Somalia, sharks were showing signs of depletion over 18 years ago (PERSGA 2002, Glaser <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Iran, the biomass of sharks (particularly  carcharhinids, that are morphologically and ecologically similar to  hemigaleids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab <em>et al.</em>  2006). Historical surveys in the Arabian/Persian Gulf indicated that carcharhinid  sharks comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980–1981,  whereas in 2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).  Similarly, results from interviews with fishermen in the United Arab Emirates indicate  that most fishers started seeing a significant decline in the abundance  of sharks over 20 years ago (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015a).&#160;Shark  catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994–1999 and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite  increasing efforts (Dissanayake 2005). Reports from India  indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already  collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). <br/></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-AU"">In Bangladesh, scientists and fishers report a<span lang=""EN-AU""> significant decline in carcharhinid catch and size over the last 5–10 years (A.B.

In Myanmar, market surveys from 2006 to 2010<span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""> reveal a 49% decline in elasmobranch landings, despite no reduction in effort (San San Khine 2010). In In<span lang=""EN-AU"">donesia, fishers have reported decreased catches and smaller sizes of sharks in recent years, including <em>Hemigaleus </em>spp. <span lang=""EN-AU"">with no species having increased in abundance over the past two decades (Jaiteh <em>et al. </em>2017). In China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured in Chinese waters (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><span lang=""EN-AU""></span></span></span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""></span></p><p>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial range of the Hooktooth Shark. The species may have some refuge from intense inshore fishing pressure where it occurs to the deeper depth range, and it appears to have a moderately short generation length which may provide some resilience to fishing pressure. Based on these factors and the level of declines in other similar inshore carcharhinids and <em>Hemigaleus</em> spp., the Hooktooth Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three  generations lengths (24 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Hooktooth Shark has a patchy distribution across the Indo-West Pacific and Eastern and Western Indian Oceans from the  Arabian Sea to the South China Sea (Hoq<em> et al.</em> 2011, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Psomadakis <em>et al.</em> 2019, A.

Jabado unpubl. data 2017). Fins are not considered valuable due to  their small size but are still traded internationally (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015b). In India, and possibly elsewhere, the offal is sometimes processed into fishmeal. <br/><br/></p>",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. Some countries across its Arabian Seas range have banned the targeted fishing for  sharks (e.g. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia). Seasonal bans on shark fishing  are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Further, UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters  (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively). In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al. </em>2020). In Malaysia, large mesh gillnets (&gt;24.5 cm) were banned in 1990 (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 18 m. The species is caught in inshore gillnet, trawl, and line fisheries throughout its range and is retained for its meat and fins. Reconstructed catches of combined sharks across the Western Indian Ocean, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea infer a population reduction of 42% over three generation lengths (24 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Inshore fishing pressure is intense throughout this shallow water species' range and it has no refuge from fishing pressure and the species is reported as both common and rare in different parts of its range. It is suspected that the Slender Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation.","The Slender Weasel Shark occurs inshore on the inner continental shelf at depths to a depth of 18 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 84 cm total length (TL) and males mature at 60–70 cm TL (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2016, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is placentotrophic viviparous with a litter size of two pups and size-at-birth of 29 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown and are inferred from another species in the family Hemigaleidae, the Hooktooth Shark (<em>Chaenogaleus macrostoma</em>), which has a female age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and a maximum age of 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 8 years (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2004).","This species is subject to high fishing pressure across the entirety of its range with no refuge at depth. It is regularly taken in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet, and handlines, and is retained for its fins and meat for human consumption. Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). This has led to a reduction in the number of shark catches in the Arabian Seas region (Mohamed and Veena 2016). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>India has an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters throughout the coastal provinces (&gt;23,000; K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across southeast Asia (Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2019). There is a high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje et al. 2002, Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Andaman Sea, there has been a shift to smaller, fast-growing, and productive sharks where <em>Paragaleus </em>spp. comprise 4.1% of the landings in the Ranong province of Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). A 165% increase in fishers occurred from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise a high majority (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Marine habitats in the region are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes which is likely to impact this species (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010).","<p></p>There are no species-specific time-series available. Fisheries in the Indian Ocean experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids, which are morphologically and ecologically similar to hemigaleids and caught in similar fisheries) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006). Historical surveys in the Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980–1981, whereas in 2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab et al. 2006). Reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). While there is limited species-specific information available on this species in the region, its low productivity and susceptibility to fishing pressure, and the presence of intensive fisheries infer that like many other carcharhinids in the region it has declined.<br/><br/>Within the Arabian/Persian Gulf, this species occurs regularly in catches, reported as 3.5% of elasmobranch landings by number in Bahrain (Moore and Pierce 2013), less than 1% of elasmobranch landings by number in Kuwait, and almost 2% of elasmobranch landings by number in Qatar (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). It also represented less than 1% of shark landings by number in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). It appears to be uncommon in Oman with only seven specimens recorded in over 5 years of landing site surveys (Henderson and Reeve 2011, Henderson and Reeve 2014) and India (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 6 February 2017). This is one of the most landed shark species in Junglighat, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, representing 3.6% (by number) of landings (Tyabji <em>et al</em>. 2020). This species could possibly represent 4.1% of shark catch in the Ranong province of Thailand, but the species identification requires verification (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018). It could possibly be the most abundant <em>Paragaleus </em>spp. in Borneo according to recent genetic work (Naylor <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is considered rare in the Philippines (Naylor <em>et al</em>. 2012, White and Harris 2013, J. Utzurrum unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, reconstructed catches of related species are available at the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale (i.e., Carcharinidae, <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and Triakidae; Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Aggregate catch of these closely related species are available from LMEs 30–38 (i.e., Western Indian Ocean, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea). Catch levels of these species grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 140,142 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,415 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>When this decline is scaled to three generation lengths (24 years) of the Slender Weasel Shark, it represents a decline of 41%. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The Slender Weasel Shark is subject to high levels of fishing pressure and varies from common to rare across its range. It is suspected that the Slender Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Slender Weasel Shark has a patchy distribution in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean where it occurs in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, India (including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands), Borneo, and the Philippines (Weigmann 2012, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species may be more widespread as a single individual Slender Weasel Shark was identified from the Philippines using molecular methods (Naylor et al. 2012). This species is often confused with congeneric Sraigh-tooth Weasel Shark (P. tengi) where their distributions overlap, e.g., in Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) (White and Harris 2013, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018, R. Yuneni unpubl. data 2020). The Slender Weasel Shark has not been recorded recently in Sabah or Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo, but molecular analysis suggests this is the dominant weasel shark there (Naylor <em>et al</em>. 2012, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).",The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets. Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><strong></strong>,Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. Some countries in the region have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting) to which they are more susceptible.<br/><br/>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi pers. comm. 25 May 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² and in Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² in which this species may occur (CTI 2020). However, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. Research is needed to determine distribution, population size and trends in abundance to further assess status and any future conservation needs.","",,false,false,Global

latitudinal distribution of Atlantic Tarpon is limited by sensitivity to low temperature (Zale and Merrifield 1989); in the extremes of their range, Tarpon experience winter thermal mortality circa 10 ºC (Robins <em>et al</em>. 1977) and have an upper lethal thermal limit of 40 ºC (Moffett and Randall 1957).&#160;The most preferred temperatures of&#160;<em>M. atlanticus&#160;</em>in the spring and fall range from 24-26 ºC, and 28-30 ºC in the summer. Seasonal migrations are most likely in association with changes in water temperature and the movement/distribution of prey (Luo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).&#160;<em>Megalops atlanticus</em> is tolerant of wide ranges in salinity and oxygen concentrations. Post-metamorphic juveniles are euryhaline, having been sampled from 0 to 45 PSU. The vascularized swim bladders of Tarpon allow aerial respiration, permitting juveniles to inhabit hypoxic inshore waters where they presumably experience low predation rates and have little competition for prey (Schlaifer and Breder 1940, Geiger <em>et al</em>. 2000, Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2004). Juvenile <em>M. atlanticus</em> habitats include stagnant pools, back waters, ephemeral coastal ponds and hurricane and storm overwashes, swales, and mangrove swamps and marshes, as well as man-made habitats such as mosquito impoundments and artificial wetlands (Dahl 1965, Wade 1962, Robins <em>et al</em>. 1977, Zerbi <em>et al</em>. 2001, Jud <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;It inhabits coastal waters, bays, estuaries, mangrove-lined lagoons, and rivers (Whitehead and Vergara 1978, Boujard <em>et al.</em> 1997); often found in river mouths and bays, entering fresh water (Boeseman 1960). It has a depth range&#160;of 0-30 m, but is usually found within 0-15 m (Whitehead and Vergara 1978,&#160;Carvalho-Filho 1999). Juveniles are more common in lower salinity waters than adults (McEachran and Fechhelm 2005).&#160;<span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51"">These habitats are often extremely fragmented, which may have adverse effects on the population.&#160; Research is needed to document whether these habitats are sources or sink.<br/><br/>Late juvenile Tarpon utilize deep-water habitats such as canals and sloughs for emigration to coastal bays (Hunt pers. comm. in Kushlan and Lodge 1974). Adult tarpon (120 cm FL) are primarily coastal fishes that inhabit inshore waters and bays over a wide range of salinities (fresh to hypersaline) and temperatures (17–36 °C) (Zale and Merrifield 1989, Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Tarpon may have resident, migratory, or mixed populations (Robins <em>et al</em>. 1977). Tagging studies indicate that some mature tarpon may undertake substantial and alongshore migrations (Ault et al. 2008, Luo<em> et al. </em>2008), while others are residents of particular locations (Guindon unpublished data, <em>sensu</em> Robichaud and Rose 2004). These movements may represent repeated migratory patterns, or there may be significant annual variation in the movement pattern of individuals (Ault <em>et al</em>. 2008). Seasonal migrations may also occur. Migrations cross state and federal boundaries, which may impact regulation.<br/><br/>Main predators of adults include bull sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), great hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna lewini</em>), American alligators (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>), and several species of porpoise (Morey 2000). This species is known to make ""thumping noises"" by producing vibrations in their swim bladder in order to aid in intra-specific communication, or to scare off predators when startled (Luna <em>et al. </em>2005).<br/><em><strong><br/></strong></em>Diet:<br/>Juveniles start on a diet of zooplankton, small crustaceans, and insects (Harrington 1958). As older juveniles and adults begin to inhabit deeper-water habitats such as lagoons, creeks, canals, their diet transitions to larger crustaceans (penaeid shrimps, swimming crabs), polychaetes, and a suite of fishes as they grow (Whitehead and Vergara 1978, Boujard <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/><br/>Reproduction and Development:<br/>Tarpon are batch spawners, and spawning season appears to vary by location. In Florida, spawning occurs presumably offshore from April through August (Smith 1980, Cyr 1991, Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1992, 1995). Spawning in Costa Rica may occur year-round (Chacon-Chaverri 1993, Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1997), similar to Puerto Rico, where peaks occur in March through May and July through September, respectively (Zerbi <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Brazil, spawning probably occurs from October through January (de Menezes and Paiva 1966). However, tarpon larvae have been recorded in the Gulf Stream through November (Harrington 1966), so spawning season may be prolonged or larvae may be transported long distances from more southern spawning locations. To date, active spawning events have not been directly observed.<br/><br/>Schools of gravid tarpon migrate from near-shore and inshore habitats to form large prespawning aggregations approximately 2–25 km offshore (Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1992) presumably before moving up to 200-250 km offshore for spawning. The exact timing, cues, and zones of tarpon spawning have not been described, although it may be triggered by lunar cycles (Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1995).&#160;In the Gulf of Mexico spawning peaks from May to July, after which planktonic larvae disperse back to coastal and inshore waters (Gaskill 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>In a single spawning season,&#160;females may produce from 4.5 to over 20 million eggs (Neidig and King 2012). Eggs and leptocephalus larvae have an extended oceanic planktonic stage (Phase I) followed by recruitment into fresh and brackish water nursery areas. After hatching, larvae of this species swim or drift with tidal currents, and recruit to shallow coastal nursery areas within 20-40 days (Tsukamoto and&#160;Okiyama 1997, Tzeng <em>et al. </em>1998, Shenker <em>et al.</em> 2002). Phase II begins at the onset of metamorphosis where larvae shrink in size from about 26 mm to 14 mm. Phase III is reflected by positive growth again through cycloid scale formation and is finished upon tarpon reaching sizes of <em>ca</em>. 40 mm in length (Harrington 1958,1966; Harrington and Harrington 1960). Phase II and Phase III larvae and juvenile tarpon will inhabit stagnant pools, back water, salt marsh and shallow mangrove lined areas that are low in dissolved oxygen and high in organic matter (Dahl 1965, Robins 1977, Zerbi <em>et al</em>. 2001). Metamorphosis is believed to take place in inshore waters. Age at recruitment to the estuary is 30–50 days (but recruiting larvae 20 days old have been captured in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida (Shenker <em>et al</em>. 2002).<span class=""sheader51"">&#160;This species is fairly long-lived compared to other elopomorphs, reaching a maximum age from 43-78 years (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><br/>Age and Growth:<span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51"">Size at recruitment: 1.4–3 cm SL<ul><li>Age of recruitment: 30–34 days (20 days in the Indian River Lagoon (Shenker <em>et al</em>. 2002)).</li><li>Maximum age in captivity: 63 years (Shedd Aquarium) or up to 80 years (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2001).</li><li>Maximimum age via validated otoliths from wild tarpon: males 43,&#160; female 55 (Crabtree <em>et al</em>. 1995).

Crabtree&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1995) showed that of the 1,469 tarpon examined, mean fork length (FL) of large females sampled from the recreational fishery was 167.7 cm FL, while mean fork length

to this species include effects of catch-and-release fishing (lethal and  sub-lethal) (Guindon 2011), recreational harvest, commercial  and subsistence fisheries in locations outside of the United States, habitat loss, freshwater flow alterations,  declines in water quality, run-off, habitat fragmentation, and habitat  alternation, such as dredging, and temperature extremes. <span class=""sheader51"">This species is long-lived, which may affect its resilience to and recovery from threats.<br/><br/>In Texas, a study done by Holt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>(2005), reported that there was no obvious decline in length modes with time among tarpon caught in the recreational fishery. It was indicated that larger tarpon tended to be caught in more recent years, this may be evidence of size selectivity by the fishers to retain larger fish for display or acknowledgement. The results of this study indicated that there may be a lack of recruitment of tarpon into the Texas fishery, especially from Mexico, after 1960, perhaps indicative of decline in nursery habitat.&#160; Alternatively, this could be due to natural fluctuations in recruitment.<br/><br/>Evidence of over-exploitation was observed in the southwest coast of Florida, in the decline in average length in the catches (Bortone 2008). Moreover, inshore waters where juvenile tarpon occur (Shenker <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002) are subject to habitat degradation due to increased human activities (Bortone 2005). It should be noted, however, that Bortone used scales largely collected and posted from 1910–1930; very few scales were from collections after 1980. This coincides with a marked shift in Florida in the 1970s and 1980s towards a catch-and-release fishery (Guindon 2011).<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on tarpon has been studied in two size classes of Tarpon. Short-term, post-release mortality of adult tarpon in the recreational fishery is due predominately to predation, and to a lesser extent physiological stress and injury. In the absence of predation, estimated post-release mortality is 5% for the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida. Other factors affecting survival of adult tarpon were the swimming condition of the tarpon at the time of release and hook location. The level of sub-lethal physiological stress was positively correlated with angling duration, handling time, and body size, especially in adult tarpon, whereas sub-adult tarpon showed less stress effects from angling (Guindon 2011). No short-term mortality was observed on juvenile tarpon released into a saltwater pond absent of sharks, and only one suffered mortality 43-hours after release. Delayed morality rates of adult tarpon are yet unknown.<br/><br/>There have been reported cases of ciguatera poisoning from ingesting tarpon. Injuries (and some deaths) are also associated with anglers attempting to catch this species due to their large size and thrashing power when hooked/pulled into a boat (Morey 2000, Hill 2002).&#160;</p>","<p>There has been no formal stock assessment of Tarpon in any portion of the species' range; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that populations of Atlantic Tarpon appear to have declined from historic levels throughout their range (Adams&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;in review). Although patchy, data on total commercial landings in Central and South America show large historical declines. Total global landings of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. atlanticus&#160;</span>declined 84.5% between 1965 and 2007 (4,600 metric tons versus 712 metric tons), particularly in Brazil, and mostly during the early years of that time period, reflecting a drop in population size, not a change in fishery effort (FAO 2011). Using a generation time of 12.7 years (Froese and Pauly 2008), the estimated decline in FAO landings over three generations (38 years, from 1969 to 2007) is at least 60%. Although this decline is driven largely from regional commercial harvest, specifically landings from Brazil, the major trends in population are mirrored in landings data from other regions, albeit from a much smaller magnitude. Therefore, we infer that the global decline in abundance is at least 30% over the last three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Although more of the fishery appears to be trending toward catch and release, historically high levels of harvest (followed by dramatic declines) and continuing harvest in some areas, suggest cause for concern. In addition,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. atlanticus</span>&#160;is a periodic species (Winemiller and Rose 1992), long-lived and late to mature, with correspondingly long generation length (&gt;10 years), which may affect its resistance to and recovery from threats. Species with long generation lengths have correspondingly high population recovery time and are thus typically more susceptible to threats that cause population declines (Collette&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Gulf of Mexico</em>: This species has two distinct populations within the&#160;Gulf of Mexico, one that spawns off the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and follows the coast of Texas to northern waters, and another that spawns offshore near Florida (Gaskill 2010).<br/><br/>Once considered the ""Tarpon Capital of the World"", Port Aransas in Texas is now virtually devoid of a tarpon population (Ault 2010).&#160;In general, current estimations of abundance for this species are based on anecdotal evidence from the recreational fishery. In Florida, anglers suspect significant regional declines over the last&#160;30–50 years, and anecdotal reports suggest declines compared to historic levels. Little scientific evidence exists to corroborate this. An analysis of the recreational Tarpon fishery in southwest Florida from 1902 through 1998 indicated that a decline in Tarpon captures began after the mid-1930s with a notable decrease during World War II (1941–45). The erratic pattern observed in this fishery could be attributed to the changes in social/recreational aspect of anglers recording data on a Tarpon scale or a decline in Tarpon landed by this fishery. There are no data currently available to test these two hypotheses. There is anecdotal information that the characteristics of the fishery changed from landings to catch-and-release, and there was a decline in recorded landings (White and Brennan 2011, Guindon 2011).&#160;Similar to the reports from Florida, a decline was also observed in Texas in the late 1950s, although this decline appeared to be more dramatic (R. Ward pers. comm. 2011), and continued in the 1960s and 1970s (Winemiller and Dailey 2002). However, length modes did not decline over time as observed in Florida (Holt <em>et al.</em> 2005). Mechanisms for apparent declines may include habitat degradation and overfishing.&#160;Florida state regulations granted Tarpon gamefish status in 1953, so they could not be commercially harvested or sold. By the 1970s, taxidermy was a booming million-dollar industry and Tarpon were killed routinely for mounts (Wade and Robins 1973), but the number of fish mounted each year began to decline in the mid-1970s (Crabtree unpublished data in Guindon 2011). In 1989, a new law was enacted and the harvest of Tarpon became regulated by Florida Statute. The number of harvest permits issued declined from 961 in 1989 to 280 in fiscal year 2009–2010, indicating a greatly reduced intended harvest, and a shift to a fishery that is almost entirely catch-and-release (Nelson 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, unpublished data). In more recent years (1981–2010), most recreational catches of Atlantic Tarpon in the USA occurred along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Applying Florida sales of harvest permits to the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey data for Tarpon caught and released in Florida, (National Marine Fisheries Service, Fisheries Statistics Division pers. comm. 2011), indicates that less than 1% of the total catch is harvested (Guindon 2011).Over the last decade, populations in Florida appear to have remained stable; however, earlier records are statistically unreliable (Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2011). One of the few estimates of a regional population of Atlantic Tarpon came from Boca Grande Pass. An acoustic survey was done in 1993, which estimated the Tarpon population in the Pass during peak spawning season to be between 24,700 and 25,400 individuals (Hedgepeth <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993).&#160;No similar data has been collected nor another population estimate made for this area since this study to determine whether or not abundance has increased or decreased. As this species is not primarily subjected to commercial fisheries, stock assessments have not been carried out throughout its range. Stock assessments or landings records in other parts of this species' range do not exist at present, particularly in developing countries. Off Mexico, this species is considered a highly desirable sportfish where it is targeted by hook and line. It does not sustain a commercial fishery. It is considered underexploited off Mexico&#160;(SAGARPA 2012).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Megalops atlanticus </em>is widely distributed across the Atlantic. In the western Atlantic it is known from Virginia (there have been records from Nova Scotia) south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along South America to northern Argentina (FMNH record) (Bigelow <em>et al</em>. 1953,&#160;Zale and Merrifield 1989, Crabtree <em>et al.</em> 1995,&#160;Smith 1997,&#160;Luna <em>et al.</em> 2005). In the eastern Atlantic it is known from Portugal, (Porto Santo, Madeira), the Azores, southern coasts of France, and&#160;along West Africa from Mauritania south to Angola (Hureau 1984, Luna<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005,&#160;Anyanwu and Kusemiju 2008). Adults have been observed off the south coast of Ireland (Twomey and Byrne 1985). This species has also become established on the Pacific coast of Panama and has extended its distribution as far northward as Costa Rica, presumably via the Panama Canal (Swanson 1946).<span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<em>Megalops atlanticus</em> is a major species in the recreational fishery in many parts of its distributional range. The recreational fishery for this species developed in 1885 in Florida.&#160;Ault and Luo (2013) stated that sport-fishing of this species in&#160;the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States&#160;supports an economic impact of $6 billion USD and 100,000 jobs. This species can only be fished recreationally (catch-and-release) in Florida. However, anglers can possess them for&#160;trophy purposes at the cost of $50.00 per tag, per fish. Otherwise, possession and commercial harvesting is illegal (Morey 2000, Hill 2002, Luna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Neidig and King 2012).&#160;It is marketed for its flesh in some areas, and is considered a delicacy in South America despite it being very bony. &#160;Large scales are used as ornamentation for home decor, and are used in the manufacturing of artificial pearls (Morey 2000, Hill 2002, Luna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;The scales are used for medicinal purposes in Brazil. In Africa, they are traditionally served at Christmas. They are consumed in Central America, when collected as bycatch or from small directed fisheries.   There are subsistence fisheries and some commercial sale of roe and flesh in Mexico and some of the Caribbean Islands (A. Adams and K. Guindon pers. comm. 2011). They are consumed readily in Colombia (Garcia and Solano 1995). This species is cultured from wild stocks of juveniles in Nigeria (Anyanwu unpublished data). They are often taken as incidental catch by purse seiners, long-liners, and in gill nets in Mexico and Belize (J. Shenker pers. comm. 2011). Although they are not targeted by fisheries in Mexico and Belize, they often enter the market upon capture (J. Ault pers. comm. 2011).<span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Despite their ecological and economic importance, recreational fishery regulations  for tarpon in the United States and abroad differ regionally. Alabama and Georgia have size limits and bag limits (one per person per day in Georgia, in Alabama a $50 tag is needed). North and South Carolina have no minimum size requirements and the limit  is one fish per person per day. In Florida, catch and release is the only fishing method allowed. In Louisiana and Mississippi, there  are no regulations. In Florida and Texas<strong>,</strong> a permit is required to  harvest or possess a tarpon (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation  Commission, K. Guindon and R. Ward pers. comm. 2011). This permit allows two tarpon per permit-holder to be caught and killed per day. Catch information (location and size) must be reported by the angler to&#160;Florida Marine Research Institute. The establishment of this permit program has greatly reduced the number of tarpon killed annually. Before the permit program was in place, in 1989 it was estimated that 342 tarpon were caught and killed by anglers. In 1998, it was estimated the number of tarpon caught and killed by anglers was reduced to only 70 (Burnham 2005). Current management regulations in&#160;Mexico<strong>&#160;</strong>require a fishing permit with gear restricted to one rod and reel (line with a maximum test of 60 kg (130 lbs) and one hook per angler. The bag limit is two fish per angler per day with a request to practice catch and release. Tarpon fishing is not allowed in protected areas or reserves. In Mexico, the limit is two fish per person per day, but no minimum size requirement exists. It is recommended that regulatory measures be implemented specific to conditions for each Mexican region including the establishment of a minimum catch size that promotes growth and reproduction of the species, the implementation of a logbook to record effort, monitoring of fishing tournaments, and promoting the practice of catch and release (SAGARPA 2012). In Belize, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, tarpon are catch-and-release only. <br/><br/>In an  effort to conserve fish stocks and their habitats, many countries are  using marine protected areas in conjunction with existing fisheries  regulations to build sustainable fisheries and protect marine  biodiversity. Catch-and-release is commonly practised by recreational  anglers with a strong conservation ethic who travel to the region. Current levels of international harvest and by-catch should be quantified, and the tertiary effects of catch-and-release fishing on tarpon should be determined to help maintain, if present, or create, if needed, a sustainable fishery.<br/><br/>Effects of catch-and-release fishing on&#160;<em>Megalops atlanticus</em>&#160;continues to be studied. Edwards (1998) found that release mortality for this species is low when proper precautions are taken, including releasing in a short period of time and allowing the fish to remain in the water while being released. Fish that were hooked in the jaw also had decreased release mortality and recovered quickly (Edwards 1998).</p><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span class=""sheader51""><span

These threats have resulted in a continuing decline in the EOO and habitat. The population is considered severely fragmented because the species has small (potentially non-viable) and isolated subpopulations in different coastal drainages due to natural causes.","<em>Hyphessobrycon fernandezi</em> inhabits plains and piedmonts in creeks, streams and lagoons with heterogeneous substrates. It is also in estuaries and brackish water. Very little information about the habitat and ecology of <em>H. fernandezi</em> is known.

Further, fluviomarine plains are associated with the regional tourism centre in beaches of Morrocoy National Park and agroindustrial developments. All rivers have cities, towns and villages on their banks. Urban and agricultural effluents are not treated before entering the rivers, and the extraction of water is high and permanent. In the plains there are several industrial centres (e.g. oil refineries). There are dams and artificial lagoons that can favour the species, but many are depauperated by urban and industrial effluents (e.g. Cumaripa and Durute reservoirs), introduced species (e.g. <em>Oreochromis </em>sp.) or desiccation by sedimentation.","<em>Hyphessobrycon fernandezi</em> is not a common species. In streams piedmonts in Aroa and Yaracuy drainages it comprised &lt;0.1% of relative abundance (Rodríguez-Olarte <em>et al.</em> 2011), but it could be common in lagoons and reservoirs.

It is demersal on the mid-continental shelf at depths of 65–150 m, although the depth range is not well defined as its mainly known from fish market landings. The species is a bycatch of mainly trawl, and possibly set net and gillnet fisheries and is retained for human consumption. There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings of all sharks, rays, and skates from Sabah and Sarawak, whiprays from Sabah, and catch-per-unit effort of rays in Indonesia infer declines of 60–72% over the past three generation lengths (31 years). Although these are not species-specific they are&#160;informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure is high across the species’ range. It occurs sympatrically and is caught with the congeneric Yellow Spotted Skate (<em>Okamejei hollandi</em>)  that is still considered common in some  of its more northern  range despite the intense  fishing pressure. This implies the Borneo Sand Skate may also have some resilience to  fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Borneo Sand Skate has undergone a population  reduction of 30–49% over the past three  generation lengths (31 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable (A2d).","<p>The Borneo Sand Skate is demersal on sandy and muddy habitats on the mid-continental shelf at depths of 65–150 m, although the depth range is not well defined as specimens have mainly been collected at fish markets (Last <em>et al. </em>2010a). It reaches a maximum size of at least 39 cm total length (TL); males mature at 34 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the similar-sized Sharpspine Skate (<em>Okamejei acutispina</em>)  that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 7.2 years and a maximum  age of 13.2 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.2 years (Joung  <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>The Borneo Sand Skate is subject to fishing pressure across its range.

Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2014, with fishing effort in Sabah also rising, particularly in artisanal fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>In Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). Batoids comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings in 2003, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>No data is available on the population trend of the Borneo Sand Skate. Despite the lack of species-specific data, reconstructed landings data are available on all combined sharks, rays, and skates in Sarawak and Sabah, and on whiprays in Sabah. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. </p><p> </p><p>  </p>  <p>In Sarawak, landings showed a 50% decline from a peak of 14,690 t in 1997 to 7,300 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to 1980, dropped then peaked again in 1995–1997 before sharply declining. In Sabah, landings showed a 37% decline from a peak of ~27,000 t in 1998 to 17,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Whipray (Dasyatidae) catches in Sabah showed a 48% decline from a peak of ~11,550 t in 1995 to ~6,000 t in 2014, despite constant effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus the declines can be used to infer reductions in these populations in Sarawak and Sabah. In Indonesia, research survey data showed an ~ 50% decline in ray catch-per-unit effort 1976–1997 throughout the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009) adjacent to the Borneo Sand Skate's range in northwestern Kalimantan. However, this is indicative only as the fisheries pressure is different in northwestern Kalimantan; there is no population trend data available from the northwestern Kalimantan area.<br/></p><p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Borneo Sand Skate (31 years), they represent declines of 72% in Sarawak, and 60% and 66% in Sabah. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of  exploitation’) is high across the spatial range of the Borneo  Sand Skate. It occurs sympatrically with the similar size cogeneric  Yellow Spotted Skate (<em>Okamejei hollandi</em>) that also occurs  further north and is still considered common in some of its northern  range (H. Ho and J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), despite the intense  fishing pressure. This implies some resilience to fishing pressure,  however across its entire range, the Yellow Spotted Skate is suspected  to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over three generation  lengths (31 years).

Since the 2004 nationwide ban on targeting sharks in coastal waters, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.<br/><br/>International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the nation provided no data to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches for a nation with a relatively small Exclusive Economic Zone. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. This is the equivalent of a 31% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (18 years) of the Ranong Guitarfish.<br/><br/>Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>The Ranong Guitarfish has a narrow distribution and while it may have some refuge from intense inshore fisheries due to its slightly deeper depth distribution, it is suspected that the Ranong Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (18 years) and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",Decreasing,"Ranong Guitarfish is found in Myanmar in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal in the Eastern Indian Ocean (Last <em>et al</em>. 2019).

Guitarfish fins are utilised, however, due to their smaller size their value is lower than the value of fins from Giant Guitarfishes or Wedgefishes, and fins from smaller individuals are generally discarded.

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>  </p><p>There is limited information relating to this species beyond its current geographical distribution which appears to be almost exclusively Borneo, and parts of Sulawesi, Indonesia.&#160;There is some evidence of extirpation of this species from the Karabakan River, near Tawau, Malaysia, where during the 1960s it was found frequently within multiple sampling stations (Inger and Kong 1962), but during sampling in 1998, only <em>A. marmorata</em> could be found there (J. Aoyama pers. comm. 2014). Exploitation of the rainforest along the river edge is thought to be the main driver of decline, suggesting that perhaps <em>A. borneensis</em> is more vulnerable than other anguillid species in the area to habitat alteration and disturbance. Other threats to <em>A. borneensis </em>have been inferred from overlap with other species with similar ranges, however, like many of the tropical anguillid species, there is no quantitative information available on how these threats specifically impact <em>A. borneensis</em>. Considerably more data are required for this species but due to the suspected reduction in abundance and associated shrinking of — an already somewhat restricted — geographic range, this species is assessed as Vulnerable (VU).<br/> <br/> Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>Little is known about the ecology of <em>Anguilla borneensis</em>. It is the only plain-coloured longfinned eel in Indonesian waters making it relatively easy to identify. Like <em>A. celebesensis</em>, it is thought that <em>A. borneensis</em> undertake much smaller-scale, local migrations to spawn (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006<em>a</em>, Wouthuyzen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017). The smallest leptocephali caught was reported in the Celebes Sea (8.5 mm TL, 20 days old) and metamorphosing larvae – just before continental recruitment as elongate glass eels – were caught in the western part of the Sulu Sea, near Borneo (49.1 mm TL, 133 days old) (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006<em>a</em>). Growth rate of the leptocephali – determined using otoliths – is estimated at 0.52 mm/day (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006<em>a</em>). At around 80 days, growth rate slowed to a plateau and larva were therefore considered to have reached their full size (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006<em>a</em>). Using otolith increment widths, leptocephali have been found to begin metamorphosis to glass eels at 117 days (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hatching dates are estimated as February to September (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006<em>a</em>). The spawning season, age of recruitment of glass eels, and total length of glass eels, are currently unknown for this species (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2014). A single <em>A. borneensis</em> glass eel that recruited to the Southern Philippines in May 2014 was 48.9 mm TL, exhibiting a well-developed pigmentation on the tip of the caudal fin, similar to those of <em>A. bicolor</em> and <em>A. interioris</em> in the western Pacific (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; </p><p>    </p><p>Note: <em>Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla borneensis</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>  </p><p>The decline of this species in the Karabakan River, Borneo is thought to have been in response to extensive exploitation of the forest alongside the river and subsequent degradation of the freshwater habitat (J. Aoyama pers. comm. 2014). As a plain coloured eel, <em>A. borneensis</em> may prove a possible target for future exploitation due to declines and restrictions in trade of other species (Crook 2014, Nijman 2015). There is, however, currently little information on specific demand for this species. In the Poso river watershed, dams for hydropower and unsustainable harvest of glass and larger eels are two reported threats (Watupongoh and Krismono 2015). In Sulawesi, mining for gold takes place, possibly affecting anguillid species in this area through mercury pollution (Muhammad <em>et al</em>. 2012, Abbas <em>et al</em>. 2017, Octaviano 2017). As with other anguillids, changing oceanic currents as a result of climate change may also impact this species.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla borneensis</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>  </p><p>Most of the current literature refers solely to the description of the species. Inger and Chin (1962), however, reported that in a river on Borneo Island (Karabakan River), 50% of eels caught in suitable freshwater eel habitat were <em>A. borneensis</em>, while the other 50% comprised <em>A. marmorata</em>. During an expedition in 1998 to the same localities, researchers found only <em>A. marmorata,</em> suggesting that this species has been severely depleted, if not extirpated, in the Malaysian territory of Borneo Island (K. Tsukamoto and J. Aoyama pers. comm. 2014). Further research and monitoring of this species are required to determine the full extent of these declines, and to gauge whether <em>A. borneensis</em> has a restricted and contracting distribution.</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla borneensis</em> has a range restricted to almost exclusively to Borneo Island, as well as some parts of Sulawesi, the surrounding Celebes Sea, Sulu Sea, Maluku Sea and the Makassar Strait region (Kottelat 1993, Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Fahmi 2015, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016, Kadir <em>et al</em>. 2017). A single specimen of <em>A. borneensis</em> was identified from southern Mindanao, Philippines in May 2014 (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes(t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability declines and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). <em>Anguilla borneensis </em>is very similar to <em>A. japonica</em> morphologically with plain skin and a long-fin, and so could potentially become a target as an alternative to <em>A. japonica</em>. According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~160 t of live eel fry (glass eels and larger juveniles) for farming from the Philippines and Indonesia. There is, however, no information suggesting that <em>A. borneensis </em>is currently used (or there are plans to use it) in eel farms in East Asia. </p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter, and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160; </p><p>Even though fishing and trade of <em>Anguilla </em>species is known to occur in all parts of the distribution of <em>A. borneensis </em>very little is known of this species’ use or trade. According to FAO data, annual catches of “River eels nei” (other eel species not included elsewhere in FAO fishery statistics) in Indonesia and the Philippines (no data is available for Malaysia) fluctuated between 1355 and 6125 t between 2008 and 2017, averaging over 3000 t per year. The proportion of <em>A. borneensis</em> in these catches, however is unknown, as this is likely to include a number of anguillid species such as <em>A. marmorata </em>and <em>A. bicolor</em>, reported as being relatively more abundant in these waters. Eels are also being farmed in south-east Asia and predominantly in Indonesia: <em>Anguilla </em>farming production (estimated 90% <em>A. bicolor </em>and 10% <em>A. marmorata</em>) of 354 t in 2015 and 511 t in 2016 has been reported (SEAFDEC 2018). According to UN Comtrade, exports of eel commodities (live, fresh, frozen and prepared eel) from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines increased from ~360 t in 2008 to ~20,000 t in 2016, however, some live <em>Anguilla </em>eel exports from South East Asian countries are known to be have been reported incorrectly in recent years, and have included significant quantities of <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels) and <em>Pisodonophis </em><em>&#160;</em>spp. (SEAFDEC 2018).</p><p>        </p><p>Unlike <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. bicolor</em>, <em>A. borneensis</em> is rarely being offered for sale on online Business to Business (B2B) trade platforms. Indonesia is one of the principal sources of glass eels being advertised on online B2B trade platforms, however, and this species may be included in mixed catches/shipments sourced from Indonesian waters. One Philippine-based company is currently offering a year-round supply of glass eels and “kuroko” (larger sizes) of <em>Anguilla </em>“species mixes” including <em>A. borneensis </em>(together with <em>A. marmorata,</em> <em>A. bicolor, A. celebesensis</em> and <em>A. luzonensis</em>).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>There are no known species-specific policies in place for <em>Anguilla borneensis</em>. Although a rare species to the Philippines, current legislation is applicable to all anguillids: in May 2012, as a precautionary measure by the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), the export of juvenile anguillid eels of a size less than 15 cm was prohibited (Crook 2014). Indonesia has legislation relating to export of glass eels that dates back to 1973, in October 2012 a new regulation came into force (Nijman 2015). The “Regulation on the Export of Glass Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.) from the Republic of Indonesia (PP 19/2012)” stipulates that the individual mass of eels exported from Indonesia must equal or be larger than 150 g, and so despite its title, encompasses glass eels, elvers, and some yellow eels (Nijman 2015). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk9241210""></a><a name=""_Hlk9598564""></a><a name=""_Hlk9241563""></a><a name=""_Hlk9241448""></a>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states (AMSs) have, since 2015, begun to examine the status of anguillid eels more closely (SEAFDEC 2018).

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p><em>A. luzonensis</em> appears to have a distribution that is mainly concentrated in Luzon Island in the Philippines, with rare records of occurrence in Mindanao and Taiwan,&#160;Province of China (hereafter Taiwan)&#160;(Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2009, Han <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2016, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). Without genetic testing, this recently discovered species is hard to distinguish from <em>A. celebesensis</em> and <em>A. interioris</em> adding further uncertainty to its true distribution and conservation status (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2009, Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p><p>There is no quantitative information available to infer abundance trends for <em>A. luzonensis. </em>However, this species has a very limited distribution, and is currently known to exist in less than five ‘locations’ where recruitment is considered to contribute to the population of mature individuals. Of all the anguillid species that recruit to the Cagayan River, this species makes up a proportion of ~40% each year (Aoyama <em>et al. </em>2015, Zoological Society London unpub. data.) and is the only locality where large recruitment of this species has been observed (Han<em> et al. 2</em>016). The Cagayan River system is affected by a number of stressors including habitat loss through sand-mining <em>(</em>Chaussard and Kerosky 2016), pollution resulting from agricultural run-off (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019)<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, and the effects of climate change, including increased typhoon activity (Holden and Marshall 2018)<em>. </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Unsustainable exploitation of glass eels to stock aquaculture farms in East Asia, is a growing concern in the Philippines (Shiraishi and Crook 2015); however, exports peaked in 2012 and 2013, and in more recent years (2014–2017) have declined (Gollock <em>et al</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2018). Despite reduced fisheries activity, bycatch is still a concern for this species, owing to sympatric distributions with species such as <em>A. bicolor</em><em> </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">and <em>A. marmorata</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, which are both currently caught and exported from the Philippines (Crook 2014, Aoyama <em>et al</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2015, SEAFDEC 2018)<em>. </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In consideration of all available information, and applying the precautionary principal, <em>A. luzonensis</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> has been assessed as ‘Vulnerable’ (VU) under category D2, based on the level of threat to this species’ limited currently known range.</span></span></span></span></p><p>      </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>Anguilla luzonensis</em>&#160;is similar to other anguillids in that it has a catadromous life history. Based on the otolith microstructure, spawning season is estimated from late winter to early spring, around February to March (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Leptocephali ranging from 29.2 to 51.2 mm have been collected offshore in the western North Pacific between the months of April and July (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012). Spawning is proposed to occur in an area of the North Pacific where leptocephali are transported on the North Equatorial Current (NEC) (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, a specific localised area could not be identified, only that specimens were caught in the region west of the West Mariana Ridge to the west or northwest of Guam (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012). As such, the spawning area potentially overlaps with those of <em>A. marmorata </em>and possibly <em>A. japonica</em>. </p><p>Using DNA identification of preserved, glass eel samples of <em>A. luzonensis</em> collected at the mouth of the Cagayan River, northern Luzon on 24 September 1994, metamorphosis was estimated to begin at ages of 104–147 days and recruit at 130–177 days old (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012). Recruitment to the Cagayan River is thought to peak between June and September/October (Aoyama <em>et al.</em> 2015, Han <em>et al</em>. 2016), although elvers have been caught between February and August in Aparri, Cagayan (Zoological Society London unpub. data.). In southern Mindanao, recruitment has been observed in May, July and August, although the species is considered rare in this locality (Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p>      </p><p>Note: <em>Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla luzonensis</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of pressures, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to threats in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>The growing exploitation – and associated illegal trade – of young, glass eels, caught to stock aquaculture programs in East Asian farms, is a threat facing all species of freshwater eel in the Philippines (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Cagayan River, this species can be found living sympatrically with other anguillid species, most commonly <em>A. marmorata</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> and <em>A. bicolor</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><em> </em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">(Aoyama <em>et al</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2015). With an increasing market for these two species – particularly <em>A. bicolor</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">as a replacement for <em>A. japonica</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> – there is concern surrounding bycatch of other, less-economically important species such as <em>A. luzonensis</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference""> (Crook 2014, Aoyama <em>et al</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. 2015, Shiraishi and Crook 2015). In 2012 the Philippines brought in a ban on the commercial export of live eels under 15 cm due to concerns in this growing exploitation, however, young eels continue to be traded illegally&#160;(Crook 2014). In recent years, glass eel fisheries have established further South in the Philippines, particularly on Mindanao. <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>    </p><p>Black sand mining for Magnetite – a type of iron used for the production of steel – has increased in the Philippines in response to demand (Chaussard and Kerosky 2016), requiring a process that uses suction pumps to filter large amounts of river water. This is believed to have reduced significantly in the Cagayan River in the last five years (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2019). Additional concerns surround pollution resulting from agricultural run-off and sediment erosion. Intensive farming practices occur along the river and eels may be exposed to run-off (M. Gollock pers. comm. 2018). Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited. The Philippines are increasingly being affected by typhoon activity, most likely as a result of climate change (Holden and Marshall 2018), and which may have the potential to reduce habitat quality. Significant localised damage caused by typhoon activity has been observed in some tributaries of the Cagayan River system (M. Gollock pers. comm.).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is little quantitative information available to infer population trends for <em>Anguilla luzonensis</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects to the species as a result of the identified pressures, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</p><p>  </p><p>A study was conducted by Aoyama <em>et al</em>. (2015) to determine species composition of glass eels at the mouth of the Cagayan River, in northern Luzon. Eels were sampled between 2008 and 2009, and again from 2011 to 2012, <em>A. luzonensis</em> was the second most common species present after <em>A. marmorata </em>(Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). The proportion of <em>A. luzonensis</em> caught remained fairly stable over the two sampling periods; from 2008–2009, <em>A. luzonensis</em> made up 41% of total catch (8,643 glass eels), and 32.5% of total catch (23,535 glass eels) in 2011–2012 (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recruitment of <em>A. luzonensis</em> between 2008 and 2009 peaked between July and September, whereas from 2011 to 2012, recruitment peaked slightly earlier, between June and September (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). Another study of elvers in the Cagayan River found <em>A. luzonensis </em>to be the dominant species over a twelve-month period from May 2015 to May 2016, making up 46% of catch in a mixed system with <em>A. marmorata</em> (44%), and <em>A. bicolor</em> (10%) (Zoological Society London unpub. data.).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Only described as a species in 2009, <em>Anguilla luzonensis</em> primarily appears to have a limited range in the Philippines with specimens found in the Cagayan River system on Luzon and in Mindanao (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2009, Han <em>et al</em>. 2012 (glass eels only)). In Mindanao, while recruitment of <em>A. luzonensis</em> has been observed, it is considered rare (Han <em>et al</em>. 2016, Shirotori <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Taiwan, glass eels of <em>A. luzonensis</em> have been observed, although rarely, between July and November (Han <em>et al</em>. 2016). Due to morphological similarities with&#160;<em>A. celebesensis</em>&#160;and <em>A. interioris,</em>&#160;molecular techniques would be required to determine the regular occurrence of this species in other areas (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2009, Leander <em>et al</em>. 2012). </p><p>  </p><p>The spawning location of <em>A. luzonensis</em> is thought to occur to the east of the Philippines in the North Equatorial Current region (NEC), after which larvae – leptocephali – enter the Kuroshio and Mindanao Currents (Kuroki <em>et al</em>. 2012, Han <em>et al</em>. 2016). Due to the timing of spawning between February and May, entrainment into the Kuroshio during May to August occurs at the same time as the NEC bifurcation reaches its most southern latitude, and when the volume of water entering the Kuroshio peaks (Han <em>et al</em>. 2016). This, combined with short larval duration, may explain why this species’ distribution is concentrated at Luzon Island (Han <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, the Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~155 t of live eel fry (glass eels and larger juveniles) for farming from the Philippines. There is, however, no information suggesting that <em>A. luzonensis </em>is currently used (or there are plans to use it) in eel farms in East Asia. </p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160; </p><p>Fishing and trade of <em>Anguilla </em>species is known to occur in <em>A. luzonensis’</em>s range, however<em> </em>very little is known of this species’ actual use or trade. According to FAO data, annual catches of “River eels nei” (other eels not included elsewhere in FAO fishery statistics) in the Philippines fluctuated between 710 and 2489 t between 2008 and 2017, averaging over 1400 t per year. The proportion of <em>A. luzonensis</em> in these catches is unknown, which includes other <em>Anguilla</em> species such as <em>A. bicolor </em><em>pacifica </em><em>(</em>the main target species in the Philippines) and <em>A. marmorata</em> (the dominant species) (SEAFDEC 2018). However, in the case of glass eel bycatch this species could possibly make up ~40% of catch in some areas/times of the year (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2015). According to UN Comtrade, exports of live eel from the Philippines (there being no records of trade in fresh, frozen or prepared eels) increased from ~300 t in 2008 to ~14,200 t in 2014, declining slightly in 2015 and 2016 to ~8500 t. However, some live <em>Anguilla</em> eel exports from South East Asian countries are known to have been reported incorrectly in recent years, and have included significant quantities of <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels) and <em>Pisodonophis </em>spp.</p><p>        </p><p>Unlike <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. bicolor</em>, <em>A. luzonensis</em> is rarely being offered for sale on online Business to Business (B2B) trade platforms. One Philippine-based company is currently offering a year-round supply of glass eels and “kuroko” (larger sizes) of <em>Anguilla </em>“species mixes” including <em>A. luzonensis </em>(together with <em>A. marmorata,</em> <em>A. bicolor</em><em> pacifica</em><em>, A. celebesensis</em> and <em>A. borneensis</em>).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>There are no known species-specific policies in place for <em>Anguilla luzonensis</em>.

It is taken as a utilised bycatch of tangle net, gillnet, trawl net, and dropline fisheries throughout Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean where inshore fishing pressure is intense. It is caught in particularly high numbers in the target fishery for rhynchobatids operating in the Arafura Sea.&#160;Levels of exploitation are very high throughout its range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean, hence it is under a severe level of threat within most of this range. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of stingrays are reported to be declining in areas of Southeast Asia for which information is available, with fishermen having to travel further and further to sustain catch levels. The species is highly sought after in Southeast Asia for the high value of its skin. Little is known of the subpopulation off southeastern Africa, although the species is probably taken as bycatch of shrimp trawlers there. Fisheries in northern Australia are generally well managed and the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) has significantly reduced the bycatch of large stingrays. In Australia, &#160;Jenkins' Whipray is considered at minimal threat throughout its wide range as there is no information to suggest that this species has declined in this area.<br/><br/>This large species may have limiting life history characteristics that make it biologically susceptible to depletion in fisheries and therefore, efforts should be made to assess and monitor mortality in fisheries and population trends throughout its range.&#160;Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is caught&#160;in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays,&#160;the level of&#160;decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations) and exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, as well as from habitat loss.&#160;Jenkins' Whipray is assessed as Vulnerable globally based on inferred levels of decline and exploitation across a large part of its range, but is considered to be Least Concern in Australia.<p><br/></p>","An inshore ray, usually found at less than 50 m depth, but also reportedly to 90 m (Compagno and Heemstra 1984, Kuiter and Debelius 1994, Stehmann 1995, Manjaji 2004, White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last and Stevens 2009). It is also seen in reef areas off Thailand (C. Vidthyanon, pers. comm. 2007). This species attains a maximum size of at least 150 cm disc width (DW) (~300 cm total length) (Last and Compagno 1999,&#160;White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Last and Stevens 2009). Males mature at about 75-85 cm DW and size at birth is around 23 cm DW (White and Dharmadi 2007, Last and Stevens 2009). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). A generation length of 20 years can be estimated based on the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Himantura astra</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacobsen and Bennett 2011), but noting that the Blackspotted Whipray&#160;grows to a much smaller maximum size (80 cm disc width) than Jenkins' Whipray (150 cm DW).","The inshore fishing pressure for Jenkins' Whipray is high throughout much of its range in Southeast Asia. In this area, most bycatch by commercial fisheries (especially trawlers) are landed and sold as food fish.&#160;This species is captured by demersal tangle net, bottom trawl, commercial gillnet and, to a lesser extent, longline fisheries&#160;(White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, White <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;<br/><br/>In Sabah (Malaysia), Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia,&#160;<em>Himantura</em>&#160;species are often caught and landed in the inshore fisheries (trawls and longlines) and are also taken by Danish seine fishing gear (M. Manjaji and Fahmi, pers. obs. 2007; Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010; W. White, pers. obs. 2014).&#160;Jenkins' Whipray and other stingrays are an important retained bycatch of the commercial gillnet fishery in Indonesia that targets rhynchobatid rays in the Arafura Sea (Last and Compagno 1999; W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Catches in inshore waters have declined and these vessels are having to travel farther to sustain catches; the rhynchobatid fisheries are very intensive in this region, thus the level of exploitation is extremely high. The species has also been observed from fish market surveys within Thailand (Krajangdara 2014). Given that this species occurs in shallow, nearshore environments, ongoing and widespread degradation of coral reefs and coastal areas throughout Southeast Asia are likely contributing to declines in the region.&#160;<br/><p>A prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea (W. White, pers. comm. 2015).&#160;Detailed species composition data for the bycatch is not currently available, but this is currently being investigated (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm. 2015), and it is possible that Jenkins' Whipray is a bycatch within this fishery.<br/></p>In Australia, catch data for this species is relatively limited, though large specimens have been reported as bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery (Stobutzki <em>et al. </em>2002). However, with the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the fishery, the ray bycatch has declined by 36.6% (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) which should translate to reductions in the catch and associated mortality of Jenkins' Whipray.","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979).<span lang=""EN-AU""> Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of Jenkins' Whipray&#160;in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.</em> 2010).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"Jenkins' Whipray has a wide but patchy occurrence in the Indo-West Pacific from southern Africa to Australia, New Guinea and north to the Philippines (Compagno and Heemstra 1984,&#160;Stehmann 1995,&#160;&#160;Manjaji 2004,&#160;Compagno&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Last and Stevens 2009).

177282313,161431,Urogymnus granulatus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2020,2015-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This is an amended version of the 2015 assessment to accommodate the change in genus from <em>Himantura </em>to <em>Urogymnus</em>.<br/><br/>The Mangrove Whipray (<em>Urogymnus </em><em>granulatus</em>) is a large-bodied (to 141 cm disc width), uncommon stingray, with a widespread distribution in the eastern Indian and western Pacific oceans, from Sri Lanka and eastern India, through to Indonesia. It also occurs along the northern coast of Australia and throughout some of the Pacific Islands. The species appears to prefer shallow inshore waters, including mangroves, estuaries, sand flats and broken rocky-sandy substrate, although adults may move offshore to at least 85 m depth.&#160;The species' preference for inshore habitats and the fact that it is apparently uncommon compared to other&#160;<em>Himantura&#160;</em>species, makes it particularly vulnerable to widespread and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution. Significant destruction and degradation of mangrove areas and targeting of juveniles in shallow waters are thought to have significantly affected this species. <br/><br/>It is caught irregularly by tangle net, bottom trawl (including large numbers of trawlers targeting rhynchobatids in the Arafura Sea) and longline fisheries and retained for human consumption. Levels of exploitation are very high throughout its range in Southeast Asia and in many parts of the Indian Ocean, hence it is under a severe level of threat within most of this range. Although no species-specific data are available, overall catches of stingrays are reported to be declining in areas of Southeast Asia for which information is available, with fishermen having to travel further and further to sustain catch levels. Species that inhabit a similar habitat to this species (such as the Sicklefin Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion acutidens</em>)) are now rarely observed in Indonesia due to high levels of exploitation, and significant declines are also inferred to have occurred in the Mangrove Whipray in Indonesia and other areas.&#160;Given the continuation of high levels of exploitation throughout its range in Southeast Asia where the species is caught&#160;in multiple types of fisheries, along with evidence for declines in catches of rays,&#160;the level of&#160;decline (&gt;30% over the last three generations) and exploitation can be inferred from overall declines in fish catches in the region, as well as from habitat loss (in particular mangroves). <br/><br/>n Australia,&#160;the Mangrove Whipray is considered at minimal threat throughout its wide range as there is no information to suggest that this species has declined in this area.&#160;Fisheries in northern Australia are generally well managed and the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) have significantly reduced the bycatch of large stingrays. There are also significant marine protected areas in this species' range. This large species may have limiting life history characteristics that would make it biologically susceptible to depletion in fisheries and therefore, efforts should be made to assess and monitor mortality in fisheries and population trends throughout its range. The Mangrove Whipray is assessed as Vulnerable globally based on inferred levels of decline and exploitation across a large part of its range, but is considered to be Least Concern in Australia.","The Mangrove Whipray appears to prefer shallow inshore waters, including mangroves, estuaries, sand flats, and broken rocky-sandy substrate, although adults may move offshore and it has been recorded to a depth of at least 85 m (White <em>et al</em>. 2006; B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto and W. White, pers. obs. 2007). This species also appears to be solitary rather than forming aggregations, like some other stingrays (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto, pers. obs. 2007). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species reaches a maximum reported size of 141 cm disc width (DW),&#160; &gt;275 cm total length (TL) (White and Dharmadi 2007, W. White, pers. obs. 2007) and size at birth is reported at 14-28 cm DW (Manjaji 2004, White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Manjaji (2004) reports that males mature at 55-65 cm DW, but the biology and life-history characteristics of this species are generally poorly known. A generation length of 20 years can be estimated based on the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011), but noting that the Blackspotted Whipray grows to a much smaller maximum size (80 cm disc width) than the Mangrove Whipray (141 cm DW).<br/><br/>Davy <em>et al</em>. (2015) examined the movement patterns of juveniles (29.5-44.0 cm DW) at Orpheus Island, Australia between March and December 2012, with the majority of individuals showing high site fidelity, and were found to seek refuge within mangrove roots; presumed to be to reduce predation risk. The preference for nearshore habitats may increase its susceptibility to habitat loss (mangroves) and fisheries interactions (Davy et al. 2015).","The Mangrove Whipray is a rare species that is caught infrequently by tangle net, bottom trawl, and, to a lesser extent, longline fisheries in Indonesia (White <em>et al.</em> 2006; W. White, pers. obs. 2007) and in other parts of its range (Moore 2012). In these areas, most bycatch by commercial fisheries (especially trawlers) are landed and sold as food fish. The Mangrove Whipray and other stingrays are an important retained bycatch of the commercial gillnet fishery in Indonesia that targets rhynchobatid rays in the Arafura Sea (Last and Compagno 1999; W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Catches in inshore waters have declined and these vessels are having to travel farther to sustain catches; the rhynchobatid fisheries are very intensive in this region, thus the level of exploitation is extremely high. There is also evidence that fisherman in these regions increasingly illegally fish in Australian waters (Chen 1996; W. White, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>This species' preference for shallow inshore waters makes it particularly sensitive to extensive and intensive artisanal and industrial fisheries operating throughout large areas of its range, as well as habitat destruction and pollution (B.M. Manjaji-Matsumoto and W. White, pers. obs, Vidthayanon 1997, Davy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Juveniles and sub-adults are targeted in mangrove areas and destruction of mangrove forests are having a significant effect on this species (W. White, pers. obs. 2007). Mangrove forests throughout Southeast Asia and large areas of the Eastern Indian Ocean have been deforested and degraded (FAO 2007). In this region, ~1.9 million hectares of mangroves have been logged during the last 25 years (FAO 2007). More than 90% of this loss has been caused by destruction of mangrove area in Indonesia, Pakistan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and India (areas where this species occurs) through conversion of land for shrimp farms, excessive logging, conversion of land for agriculture or salt pans and degradation through oil spills and pollution (FAO 2007). Even in well-managed mangrove areas that are protected from destruction, for example, the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Ranong, Thailand (designated in 1997), this species may still face threats from local fisheries on which the people living in the reserve primarily depend (FAO 2007).<br/><br/>The Sicklefin Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion acutidens</em>) occurs at similar depths to this species' preferred bathymetric range; the Sicklefin Lemon Shark&#160;is rarely observed in recent times in Indonesia due to the very high level of exploitation of inshore waters and its slow growth rate (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The Mangrove Whipray is apparently uncommon compared to other large&#160;<em>Himantura</em>&#160;species in this region, making it particularly susceptible. Given that this&#160;is a large stingray, probably with 'slow' life-history characteristics also, by comparison it is inferred that this species has also declined significantly in these areas.&#160;Artisanal inshore fishing pressure is also very intensive off eastern India (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Fisheries throughout India operate on an open access basis and inshore marine species are thought to be fully or overexploited, with extensive use of illegal mesh sizes reported, and increasing bottom trawl effort (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Demersal species, such as this, suffer more fishing mortality than pelagic species on the eastern coast of India (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). India's inshore fisheries are generally characterised by declining catch rates, declining recruitment and biomass, and a shift from regular landing patterns (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). Although no species-specific data are available on catches, it is inferred that this species has also suffered declines as a result of high levels of inshore exploitation in these areas also.<br/><br/>In Australia, catch data for this species are relatively limited, though large specimens were previously reported as bycatch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery. However, with the introduction of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the fishery, the ray bycatch has declined by 36.6% and there is likely to have been significant reductions in the catch and associated mortality of the Mangrove Whipray&#160;(Brewer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).<br/><br/>No data or information is available on catches in the Pacific Islands, but this species may be taken as bycatch in inshore subsistence and artisanal fisheries there also.","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Globally, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;Batoids are heavily exploited (White and Dharmadi 2007) and datasets from as early as 1963–1972 show the considerable decline in batoids in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly 1979).<span lang=""EN-AU""> Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White, unpubl. data). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Mangrove Whipray&#160;in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al.</em> 2010).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Mangrove Whipray is likely widespread in the Indo-West Pacific, around the Red Sea, Maldives, New Guinea, Micronesia, Gulf of Thailand, the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and off the Andaman, Santa Cruz, and Solomon Islands (Last and Stevens 2009).

It is demersal on the continental shelf to an estimated depth of 30 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, although primarily from trawling. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with likely high discard mortality. Suspected population reductions over three generation lengths (14 years) range from 25–63% based on reconstructed landings and results from trawl surveys. Fishing pressure is high across the majority of this species’ range, although the ban on trawling in Omani waters since 2011 provides some refuge. It is suspected that the Oman Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (14 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Oman Numbfish is a poorly known, inshore species that has been captured to depths down to 30 m (Carvalho and Randall 2003, Psomadakis <em>et al. </em>2019). This species reaches a maximum size of at least 41.5 cm total length (TL) (Sujatha <em>et al.</em> 2016); females mature at 31 cm TL and size-at-birth is 11 cm TL (Carvalho and Randall 2003, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data. The Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Oman Numbfish (93 vs 42 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 4.7 years for the Oman Numbfish. <strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><strong><strong></strong></strong>","It is caught as bycatch in India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020) and likely also in Sri Lanka and Iran, where fishing pressure is heavy and intensifying. Even though the species is typically discarded, the numbfishes are thought to suffer from high post-release mortality. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 2/2/2017). Intensive demersal fisheries operate where the species occurs around Iran, India and Sri Lanka, for example, more than 15,000 small traditional crafts (48% motorized) operate in the lagoons and coastal areas of Sri Lanka (Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). No specific information is available on catches of the Oman Numbfish as species-specific data are not recorded, however, the high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. While numbfishes are very susceptible to capture in trawls, it has also been recorded in the catch of the large mesh (14 inch) bottom set gillnet ray fishing in Sri Lanka (De Zoysa 2014). In the Gulf of Mannar, India, the species has been recorded as bycatch in shallow water trawling (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Some 2,973 Indian trawlers operate in the Gulf of Mannar (Ministry of Agriculture et al. 2012). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The demand for seafood is very high in Myanmar, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 48–52 kg per capita in 2013–2016 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020).<br/><strong style=""font-weight: bold;""></strong><strong style=""font-weight: bold;""></strong>","There are no population estimates for the Oman Numbfish in any part of its range, but there are two sources of declines estimates based on landings information. First, the population of the Oman Numbfish is suspected to have declined off India due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).<br/><br/>Second, despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined shark and ray species from fisheries within the Myanmar Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel “Dr Fridtjof Nansen” in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>When these inferred declines are scaled to the three generation lengths of the Oman Numbfish (14 years), they represent population reductions of 63% and 25% in India and Myanmar respectively. These levels of reduction are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Oman Numbfish. Dramatic declines have been documented in populations of similar species, where they are heavily fished. Overall, based on inferred reductions across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (14 years).",Decreasing,"The Oman Numbfish has a patchy distribution in the Western and Eastern Indian Ocean from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal including Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Psomadakis et al. 2019, M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 24/10/2020).","Numbfishes are not consumed as human food and are presumably discarded due to their small size (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Although rare in Pakistan, this species is landed in the unsorted bycatch of trawl fisheries and is used in the production of fish meal (M. Moazzam Khan pers comm. 24/10/2020). In Sri Lanka, many fishers will wait until landing or wait for numbfishes to die before sorting their catch in fear of being electrocuted (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. Oman has banned trawling in its waters since 2011 which may benefit this species. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite this, the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020). Effective monitoring of fisheries is required, as is the effective implementation and management of marine protected areas. Research is needed to determine distribution, population size and trends in abundance to further assess status and any future conservation needs.","",,false,false,Global

Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).<br/><br/>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km in length) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and bottom-dwelling rays like <em>Narcine </em>species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The demand for seafood is very high in Myanmar, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 48–52 kg per capita in 2013–2016 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020).<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s led to fully exploited inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020b). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020b). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020b).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily overexploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). Since the 1980s, demersal trawls are the dominant gear followed by purse seines and small-scale gear (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).","There are no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. It is locally abundant in shallow water across its range (Last et al. 2016). The population of the Brown Numbfish is suspected to have declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, reconstructed catch data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid 1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in catch can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel “Dr Fridtjof Nansen” in 1978-80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Thailand, landings data are available on all combined ray species from the EEZ for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed landings showed a 30% decline from a peak of 17,604 t in 1999 to 12,314 t in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1990s, dropped during the early 2000s then rose to the 2014 landings. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. In western Peninsular Malaysia, reconstructed landings showed a 54% decline from a peak of 19,308 t in 1979 to 8,902 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to the peak catch in 1979 then have been fluctuating considerably since then. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in these populations in west coast, Peninsular Malaysia.<br/><br/>While not a whipray, the Brown Numbfish is in a similar depth range and susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of numbfishes. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed landings showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths (15 years), of the Brown Numbfish they represent declines of 57%, 30%, 22%, 24%, 59%, 93%, 78%, and 19% in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The declines range from 19–93%, although across most of its range, the declines are 22–59%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Brown Numbfish. Dramatic declines have been documented in populations of similar species, where they are heavily fished, yet this species is still reported as locally abundant in shallow water which implies some resilience to fishing pressure. Overall, based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (12 years).",Decreasing,"The Brown Numbfish has a broad distribution in the Indian, Western Central, and Northwest Pacific Oceans ranging from Pakistan to south China including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Viet Nam (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Numbfishes are not consumed as human food and presumably discarded due to their small size (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Pakistan, this species is landed as part of the unsorted bycatch of trawl fisheries and is used as raw material in the production of fish meal (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 24/10/2020). In Malaysia, and for small individuals in Cambodia, it is used for 'trash fish' (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020), that is, for fish meal and other products. In Bangladesh, Narcine species are sometimes discarded at sea as fishers fear being electrocuted by them (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, many fishers will wait until landing or wait for numbfishes to die before sorting their catch in fear of being electrocuted (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"No species-specific measures are in place. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard et al. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (MacKeracher et al. 2020). <br/><br/>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12°N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Brown Numbfish and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It inhabits estuaries and sand flats near seagrasses and coral reefs from the surface down to a depth of 100 m.

They presumably reach a maximum size of 150 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 51 cm DW and females mature at 75–80 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is presumably matrotrophic viviparous with an annual reproductive cycle (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Age-at-50% maturity for females is 5.5 years and maximum age in the wild is 17 years in southwest Florida (Hayne <em>et al.</em> 2018) and therefore generation length is estimated to be 11.3 years based on its congener the Southern Stingray (<em>Hypanus americanus</em>).</p>","Lutz's Stingray is valued in Brazil and retained for local consumption and captured as bycatch of commercial and artisanal fisheries. Coral reefs and seagrasses in the area are degraded by coastal development, pollution, and climate change (Leão <em>et al. </em>2010, Copertino <em>et al. </em>2016), and this is leading to a decline in habitat quality for this species.&#160;Increased artisanal fishing pressure in some regions of Brazil may warrant concern, including in the states of Ceará and Bahia (Buckup 2000, Gadig<em>&#160;et al. </em>2000).","<p>In Ceará, Brazil, this species is targeted and valued, but has not declined in artisanal landings over the past 15 years (V. Faria unpubl. data 2018) and appears to be the most abundant species in artisanal elasmobranch landings (Santander-Neto and Faria 2020). However, elsewhere in Brazil this species is exposed to considerable fishing pressure. In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). Due to the actual and potential levels of exploitation across its shallow inshore range, the fact that it has exhibited declines where it is targeted, and its large size, it is suspected that Lutz's Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (32 years).</p><p><br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>",Decreasing,"<p>Lutz's Stingray occurs in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean and is endemic to Brazil ranging from the Amazon outflow south with confirmed records from&#160;Parcel de Manuel Luiz in Maranhão&#160;down to São Paulo State (Petean <em>et al.</em> 2020).

Due to overfishing, its population has experienced global-level declines of between 30-50% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). These declines are&#160;reflected in a documented 93% decline in imports to Hong Kong markets over at least the past 18 years despite its continued high market value. Loss and/or major reductions of spawning aggregations has also occurred in parts of its range. Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable A2bd.&#160;Future assessments of this species should account for the possibility that separate species may be recognized from the Red Sea versus the remainder of its currently recognized range. A key recommendation is to focus conservation and monitoring actions on spawning aggregations and reduce fishing effort.","This species inhabits lagoon and seaward reefs in areas with rich coral growth. It is most frequently encountered in channels along the reef front. Its maximum length is 73 cm. It feeds exclusively on fishes. The species commonly co-aggregates with the camouflage grouper (<em>Epinephelus polyphekadion</em>)&#160;and brown-marbled grouper (<em>E. fuscoguttatus</em>). The sexual pattern of the species is unresolved; however, males have been found to be older and larger than females at first observed maturity, which suggests the potential for protogynous hermaphroditism (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2014). Egg and larval dispersal are highly localized (Almany <em>et al. </em>2013). In Palau, mature females ranged between 34.7 and 51 cm fork length, and males between 39 and 55.7 cm, but size distribution varied significantly between aggregations. In Pohnpei, the mean standard length for mature females was 39 cm, with males averaging 46.2 cm (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). Age at first maturity is two years and longevity is 13 years (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2011). Males and females differ significantly in size, with males larger and older than females. The total instantaneous mortality in Pohnpei has been estimated at Z = 0.428 (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2013). Applying&#160;an age at first maturity of 2 years and longevity of 12 years, the generation length is estimated as 7 years based on the following equation: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.&#160;In Chuuk, Micronesia, the oldest individual was aged at 11 years old and 59.4 cm total length and the length at 50% maturity was 31-32 cm (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).<br/><br/>The species forms spawning aggregations during specific lunar phases depending on locale.&#160;Males tend to arrive to aggregation sites individually or in small groups&#160;one to four days earlier than females to establish territories. Females arrive in large schools and appear to spend several hours integrating with males in the aggregation (K. Rhodes pers. obs). Individuals of both sexes appear to use reproductive migratory corridors to reach aggregation sites, which increase their vulnerability to fisheries (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). In the Solomon Islands (and likely elsewhere),&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;moves to shallow reef habitats (e.g., reef flat) at night during spawning periods. These areas are easily accessible to fishers, who then obtain exceptionally high catches over short periods of time (Johannes 1988, Hamilton 2007). An acoustic telemetry study revealed that individuals are capable of moving to and from spawning sites over a minimum of 23 km and maintain home range areas of 0.004 to 0.12 km while residing in areas of high coral cover (Hutchinson and Rhodes 2010). Distances averaging 0.34 km&#160;from the home range are travelled for feeding, and an average movement of five to 10 km are travelled for spawning and up to about 23 km are traveled along reproductive migratory corridors (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). As demonstrated by Pohnpei&#160;fisheries data collected in January 2005 over a five-day period leading up to the 'normal' full moon spawning time, some aggregations that appear within the presumed reproductive season, including some of substantial size, may not be reproductive and composed entirely, or nearly so, of a single sex (K. Rhodes and Tupper unpublished data). If confirmed, fishing on large, same-sex aggregations could impact sex ratios during subsequent reproductive periods in a manner similar to that shown for other aggregating groupers (Koenig <em>et al.</em> 1996). Aggregation-associated abundances can number in the thousands of individuals (Conservation Society of Pohnpei unpub. data). However, there are&#160;many areas with aggregations that may be naturally small that are composed of tens to hundreds of individuals (Hamilton pers. comm. 2016).<br/><strong style=""""><br/>Known spawning aggregation sites:&#160;</strong>One of the earliest records of spawning aggregations of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;was in the Solomon Islands (Johannes 1988). Johannes (1988) noted aggregations in two outer reef passages and counted no more than 100 fish at any one time. A total of 5,781 individuals were recorded at the Pohnpei Kehpara Marine Sanctuary in Palikir Pass, Ant Channel spawning site during peak aggregation periods in 2001 (J. Pet pers. comm.&#160;2016). Aggregations have been recorded as deep as 70 metres in Pohnpei (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Spawning aggregations are known from the Solomon Islands in front of Uepi Island, at Nusa Agana, Shark Point and Njari (Western Province). A total of eight potential and known aggregation sites of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;occur in Palau (Sadovy 2007).&#160;In Palau, it aggregates in Ebiil, Western Entrance and Ngerumekaol. Other aggregations are located in the Chagos Archipelago, the Mundoo Channel in the Maldives, Kiribati and the Abaiang atoll, in Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Samoa. Occasional individuals are sighted in Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea (Allen 1998). In Indonesia's Komodo National Park, the species formed spawning aggregations during full moon periods from September to February and occasionally during new moon periods (Pet <em>et al</em>. 2005). At Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, Hamilton and Kama (2004) identified seven spawning sites for&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;through fisher interviews, with a reported peak in spawning activity between October and January during third quarter to new moon lunar phases. Spawning aggregations have been recorded from the Lakshadweep Islands (Karkarey <em>et al.</em> 2011).<strong><em><br/></em></strong>","The major threat to this species&#160;is commercial fishing for the commercial live reef food-fish trade, particularly heavy fishing effort targeting spawning aggregations (Sadovy<em> et al</em>. 2003). Reductions in population densities and changes in habitat use have also been noted as a result of climatic disturbance, which suggests the potential for future negative impacts from climate change (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hamilton (unpub. data) reports that night-time spear fishing in the Solomon Islands is a threat to spawning aggregations due to exceptionally high catch rates. Fishing pressure from subsistence fishing is not usually considered a major threat.<strong><em><br/></em></strong>","This is possibly the most abundant&#160;<em>Plectropomus</em>&#160;species in the central Western Pacific. However, there have been severe declines in certain areas, due in part to targeting of spawning aggregations by local and foreign commercial fishers driven by its high value in the international live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Vincent 2002, Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In Pacific countries, it is the most abundant and main target grouper species for the Live Reef Food Fish Trade. Although spawning can be induced in this species, it is not commercially raised in hatcheries (Tucker and Fitzgerald 1994, Y. Sadovy pers. obs.); however, juveniles are harvested from the wild for grow-out in aquaculture, which exacerbates population decline (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).<br/><br/>There appears to be intensification of fishing effort throughout the area where this species is fished for sale in the live reef fish food trade. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is a medium-valued low-volume fish with annual reported imports into Hong Kong in the hundreds of tonnes only. Sources are mainly Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, all caught in the wild. Often it is harvested from spawning aggregations and is very easy to overfish if the aggregations are targeted. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is also referred to in AFCD (Hong Kong Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department) and C&amp;SD (Census and Statistics international trade data of the Hong Kong government) databases as Spotted Coralgrouper/Trout and AFCD confirmed that these common names refer to <em>P. areolatus</em> in both databases. Fish enter Hong Kong both by air and vessel (Hong Kong live fish vessels or HKLFV). This species makes up just a small proportion of the HK-based live reef fish trade with an increasing proportion being imported by sea compared to air (Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Landings in the Philippines declined precipitously between 2015-2016 (Santos<em> et al. </em>2017). According to declining trends in trade data, large-scale population declines are likely to have occurred as a result (Y. Sadovy and K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). The amount imported to Hong Kong in 1997 was 2,319 tonnes (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999), which subsequently declined to 69 tonnes in 2006 before increasing to an average of around 150 tonnes from 2007 to 2014, an anomalous increase in imports to 458 tonnes was recorded in 2015 (possibly due to the Philippines, see Santos <em>et al.</em> 2017), but returned in 2016 to about 160 tonnes, which represents an overall decline of 93% over the past 18 years (Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2016, Sadovy de Mitcheson <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the last two years,&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;has not been as common in the market in mainland China; therefore, the decline observed in Hong Kong's statistics is implied to also be occurring in mainland China as well (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).&#160;We suspect that the imports into Hong Kong are representative of a large portion of the range of this population, but there are portions of its range beyond the normal live reef fish food trade influence. For example, fish traders in Hong Kong do not import from the Indian Ocean west of the Maldives (K. Ma pers. comm. 2016). Therefore, we suspect that the actual global-level declines over the past three generation lengths (21 years) is between 30-50%. In addition, many spawning&#160;aggregations are declining somewhere in the order of&#160;60 to 100% (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2016, J. Pet pers. comm. 2016, Conservation Society of Pohnpei&#160;and A. Hughes unpub. data).<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong><br/><strong style="""">Maldives:<em>&#160;</em></strong>In the Maldives, <em>Plectropomus areolatus</em> abundance is lower in the more heavily fished outer reef channels than in less intensely fished channels on the western side of Laamu Atoll (Sluka 2002). In 2011, an annual maximum sustainable yield of 87.41 metric tons was suggested for the entire Maldives (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). The Maldives was once a major importer of live Squaretail Coralgrouper. Between 1994 and 1996, over 500 mt of live groupers (all species combined) were exported annually. By 2007, exports were less than 100 mt. Between 2004 and 2010, exports of chilled groupers increased five-fold from around 150 mt to 550 mt, representing around 450,000 fish (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In addition, mean lengths of squaretail coralgrouper declined from over 50 cm to less than 40 cm between the 1987-1991 and 2010-2011 periods.<em><br/></em><strong style=""""><br/>Kiribati and other Pacific locales:&#160;</strong>The species is apparently the most abundant live reef food fish species in the Fijian Islands (Yeeting <em>et al.</em> 2001). Aggregation sites, such as Mali Passage, are no longer considered productive after protracted fishing at that site. Much of the current fishery appears to be illegal, unregulated and unmonitored and the fishery is heavily reliant on both nighttime and SCUBA spearfishing, which are known to be unsustainable fishing methods. Catch-per-unit-effort reportedly substantially&#160;declined in just 10 years. In 2015, the estimated take of groupers was in excess of 20 mt, which is considered unsustainable and greater than the volumes taken from Bua in the past when the live reef food fish trade was targeting aggregations for export&#160;(Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). In Abaiang Atoll of the Gilberts Group (Kiribati), targeting of spawning aggregations had been practised in historical tradition, but pressure increased to an intense level in the 1980s during the implementation of the Outer Island Fisheries Project. The Project buys fish from the outer islands to sell in the capital city of Tarawa. During peak fishing season, daily catch of<em> P. areolatus</em> was about two tonnes (about 1,200 individuals). An underwater visual survey conducted during this same time period showed a mean density of 0.13 individuals per 100 m², with a mean individual total length of 40 cm (Yeeting unpub. data 1999). A subsequent survey in 2004 showed that mean density had declined to 0.04 individuals per 100 m², and mean total length declined to 33 cm (ProcFish 2005). Other densities (per 100 m²) and mean total length (cm) estimates are as follows: 0.19 and 37 in Abemama, Kiribati; 0.0057 and 50 in Chuuk, FSM; 0.0072 and 38 in Salelavalu, Samoa; 0.074 and 44 in Funafuti, Tuvalu; 0.081 and 37 in Nukufetau, Tuvalu (ProcFish 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Palau:&#160;</strong><em>Plectropomus areolatus</em>, along with&#160;<em>Epinephelus fuscoguttatus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Epinephelus polyphekedion</em>, dominate the commercial catch of groupers in Palau (Kitalong and Dalzell 1994). At least four Palau grouper spawning aggregations have disappeared since the 1970s, including one composed primarily of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>. Sites include Rebotel, Mesikm near German Channel and Uchul a Chei on the southern tip of Ngermediu reef (lost in the 1970s) (N. Idechong pers. comm. 2016). An aggregation site of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. fuscoguttatus</em>&#160;was virtually eliminated at Denges in the late 1980s by a live grouper export fishing enterprise (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999). Possibly as a result of fishing pressure, the <em>P. areolatus</em> aggregation at Ebiil has been reduced in size to only one of two sides of the channel (Johannes <em>et al.</em> 1999).&#160;Evidence collected in 2008-2009 from enhanced underwater visual census confirmed that aggregations of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;are confined to one side of the channel. Estimates of abundance showed aggregations with highest abundances in May-July of around 450 individuals and between 200 to 300 individuals in April and September (PCS and SCRFA 2010). Market surveys conducted in August 2010 showed substantial numbers of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;still entering the fishery prior to the sales and catch and closure, with increasing numbers marketed&#160;as the August spawning period commenced. During this period, 776 individuals were marketed (PCS and SCRFA 2010), with a mean size of 17 cm (presumably total length). Many of these individuals are assumed to be female and/or below the size at sexual maturity (Rhodes<em> et al</em>. 2013). In 1996, very limited recruitment was observed in Ebiil and Western Entrance spawning aggregations, and negligible recruitment occurred at Ngerumekaol, suggesting that the larval settlement of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;two to three years earlier may have been very low. About five to 10 times as many females as males were counted in the most lightly fished area (Western Entrance), compared to heavily fished areas (Johannes<em> et al.</em> 1999). This sex ratio may be responsible for the aggressive behaviour observed between sexes and may have prevented spawning.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Micronesia:</strong>&#160;The density of fish<em>&#160;</em>in&#160;spawning aggregations declined by 60% from 2005 to 2013 in Pohnpei (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2014), but has stabilized since its initial decline in 2005, albeit at only one-third of its 2005 density.&#160;In 2006, a Pohnpei&#160;survey showed that&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;comprised &gt;12% of groupers targeted by the spear and line fishery and was the sixth most abundant grouper in marketed catches, with the majority of the catch composed of juveniles: 75.6% and 97.2% of marketed catch of females and males, respectively, below the mean size at sexual maturity&#160;(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). By 2015, the species ascended to the second most abundant grouper observed in marketed catch, representing 19% of the grouper fishery (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). Eighty-one percent of marketed&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;were above the 50% size at sexual maturity for females. Consistent declines in aggregation abundance have been documented within the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary, with a 69% decline in density observed between 2001 and 2013 and the notable disappearance of individuals along the shallow-water transect over this time-frame (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2014). In 2013, average densities in the aggregation were eight individuals per 100 m². Local commercial fishers are also responsible for targeting spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways, resulting in reduced abundances following heavy fishing (Rhodes and Tupper 2008, Johannes <em>et al</em>. 1999, Hamilton and Kama 2004). Protracted fishing in the absence of effective enforcement has resulted in a 69% decline in mean density at one aggregation site in Pohnpei, with notable&#160;changes in depth distribution (Rhodes <em>et al.</em> 2014). Obvious changes in percent contribution to marketed catch and size distribution were observed during a 10-year follow-up market survey in 2015, with an increase in contribution from 12% to 19% over 10 years (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).&#160;In Chuuk, Micronesia, the absence of gravid females in market samples suggests that spawning aggregations are not a major target for this fishery (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). A 12-month Chuuk&#160;market study,&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;was the third in abundance among all species sampled from the catch, and contributed 15.4% to the total mixed-gear fishery, with 49% of captured individuals immature&#160;(J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).&#160;During recent underwater visual surveys, the species was recorded at only two of four Pacific Island countries: Pohnpei and Yap, and was not recorded in Guam and Kosrae. Densities in Pohnpei were 1.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>, 0.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>&#160;on Ifalik Atoll, and 0.43 individuals/ha<sup>-1&#160;</sup>at Satawal Atoll&#160;(B. Taylor unpub. data 2016).<br/><br/><strong style="""">Indonesia: </strong>Spawning aggregations of this species across Indonesia appear to be largely decimated, based on low densities of fish in inshore waters (J. Pet pers. comm. 2016).&#160;Despite protection of spawning aggregation sites as of 2001 in Indonesia's Komodo National Park, heavy fishing pressure continued. A five-year monitoring program conducted from 1995-2000 at two spawning aggregation sites within the park, recorded that the mean length of individuals decreased by 8 cm and fish numbers at aggregations were low, at less than 100 per aggregation site and period (Pet <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enforcement and monitoring lapses in this park resulted in the apparent extirpation&#160;of at least one aggregation site and significant declines in others (Mangubhai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;At Ayau, Raja Ampat, approximately 300 individuals were observed in a spawning aggregation that formed in areas of high coral cover on the southeast corner of the island (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;After the implementation of stricter rules governing marine protected areas in Aceh, individuals of this species increased in length from 16 to 35 cm by 2009, and some observed were greater than 40 cm in 2010 (Yulianto <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea:<em>&#160;</em></strong>Hamilton and Smith (2005) reported that two to three Manus fishers (Papua New Guinea) can remove an estimated 100 individuals per night from spawning sites using night-time spearfishing techniques; as a result of this heavy pressure, abundance and catch declines have occurred (Hamilton 2003). Marovo (Solomon Islands) fishermen state that the average aggregation&#160;size of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;has been declining since spearfishing became widely practised in the area. Increasing human population in the Western Solomon Islands (doubling about every 17 years) is also exerting pressure on the species.&#160;In Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, 24-hour daily fishing operations between 1996 and 1997 removed an estimated three to four tonnes of grouper species per trip, including&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(Hamilton and Kama 2004). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) records from Roviana Lagoon estimate a catch rate of 16.8 kg/hr per fisher during the course of 41 fishing trips (Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2005). At least one Roviana&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em> aggregation has been fished to economic extinction (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2005). In addition, destructive fishing practices associated with this fishery significantly damaged coral reef habitat within the aggregation site (K. Rhodes pers. obs.). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, the live reef food fish trade has operated sporadically during the past decade and spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways are systematically targeted; as a result,&#160;declines in abundance have frequently been severe. Community-based monitoring and enforcement has resulted in improvements in aggregation abundance and density inside protected areas at Djual, New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, with a 37-fold difference in mean densities being detected between areas inside protected areas (7.34 individuals/1,000 m²) versus outside (0.2 individuals/1,000 m²) (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2016).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Australia:<em>&#160;</em></strong>The only known statistics on the&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;fishery come from the Torres Strait where it is lumped with other live reef fish. Live fish exports in 2011-2012 were 930 tonnes (AUD$31,953), 832 tonnes ($30,664) in 2012-2013 and 910 tonnes ($34,174) in 2013-2014 (Savage and Hobsbawn 2015).<strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><br/>British Indian Ocean Territory:&#160;</strong>This species was not observed between 2010 and 2015 across several underwater visual survey sites that included Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Djibouti and Comoros, but was observed at Chagos in six of the 13 sampling sites, with an average abundance of 0.23 ±0.21 individuals per 250 m² and a mean biomass of 423.79 ±476.68 grams per 250 m² (M. Samoilys unpublished data 2016).<br/><strong><br/>Saudi Arabia:</strong> In the&#160;Saudi Arabian portion of the Red Sea, FAO fishery catch statistics recorded that an average of 400 metric tons of this species were landed from 2000-2014.<br/><strong style=""""><br/>Sudan: </strong>This species was present at eight out of 40 survey&#160;sites along the coast&#160;of&#160;Sudan in 2007 (Cousteau 2008, M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016).",Decreasing,"This Indo-Pacific species has a somewhat patchy distribution in the Indian Ocean where it is known from the Comoros, Red Sea, the Maldives, Chagos,&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">the Laccadive Islands and Gulf of Mannar,</span>&#160;the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Myanmar and Thailand&#160;(Nair 2015, R. Myers pers. comm. 2016). In the Pacific, it occurs from the Philippines north to the Ryukyu Islands (Japan) and south to Indonesia, Australia (northern Western Australia and Queensland), Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and most of Micronesia. Its depth range is 1-70 metres (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2017).","This species is heavily exploited by local and foreign commercial fishers, especially when forming spawning aggregations. Most fish are sold for a high value to the international live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Vincent 2002, Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sadovy de Mitcheson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). It is taken for both live and fresh/dead for international and national trade using a combination of line, trap and possibly chemicals (sodium cyanide) and common consuming size is 38–50 cm total length (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999). The Maldives was also once a major importer of live Squaretail Coralgrouper (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In Pohnpei, marketed fish were derived primarily from inner reef locales using spear (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). In Fiji,<em>&#160;</em>groupers in northern Vanua Levu outer reef passages are intensively fished during the spawning season of several important grouper species. The fishery includes both local and international markets and current exports are primarily for chilled fish. As a result of the international trade and overfishing in general, local markets are having increasing problems acquiring enough fish for local consumption (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). It is known to be fished in at least the following localities:&#160;the Maldives, Fijian Islands, the Gilberts Group (Kiribati), Samoa, Micronesia, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia and&#160;Saudi Arabia (Red Sea).",Marine,"This species&#160;occurs in several protected areas throughout its range, including some specifically designed to protect spawning aggregations (Rhodes <em>et al</em>. 2005). Seasonal closures associated with spawning times are also in place in some areas (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002), but enforcement&#160;is not effective (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Size-limits and catch quotas have also been imposed in various sites in Australia. In Queensland (Australia), the catch size limits applied across all sectors of the coral reef fin fish fishery that includes commercial and recreational fishers, and charter boat operators are a minimum 38 cm total length and a total combined bag of seven individuals. The minimum size limit is designed to ensure that at least half of the fish in a population reach reproductive maturity and spawn before harvest.<br/><br/>In&#160;Palau, the Marine Protection Act of 1994 prohibits sale or purchase of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(and&#160;<em>E. polyphekadion</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>E. fuscoguttatus</em>) from April 1 through July 31 each year, with the intention to protect spawning aggregations. In 1995, the Act was amended to prohibit any capture of these groupers even for subsistence purpose in the closed period (Johannes<em> et al</em>. 1999). A four-month bul (taboo) was enforced in the state of Ngeremlengui (Palau), but was not completely effective in preventing fishing on aggregations. Recently, the national ban was extended from 1 April to 31 October and there is a three-year ban commencing July 2015 in Ngarchelong and Kayangel State until July 2018. Export is allowed during the open season, but there is a 50 lb. limit per person for reef fish (S. Victor pers. comm. 2016). In Pohnpei (Micronesia), a&#160;sales ban is enforced during the January-May spawning season on all groupers, which includes&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). Three Pohnpei&#160;marine protected areas are in place to protect spawning aggregations for this species, but abundance declines have occurred over more than a decade for one of the three sites. No information is available for the other two sites due to the lack of monitoring (Rhodes<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2005). In Chuuk (Micronesia), a&#160;law implemented in 2015 bans grouper sales, catch and export from January to May, which is during the spawning season of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;and other known aggregating groupers (C. Graham pers. comm. 2015). In Karimunjawa National Park (Indonesia), fishers imposed a self-regulatory ban on catch of&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;in 2010. As of 2011, no&#160;<em>P. areolatus</em>&#160;were found in catch and sizes had increased from &lt;15 cm in 2005 to &gt;40 cm in 2010 (Yulianto<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2015). Community-based enforcement and monitoring of a marine protected area in Djual and New Ireland, Papua New Guinea resulted in the recovery of densities in aggregations (Hamilton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Hamilton<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2016). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, trap fishing is now banned.<br/><br/>Aggregation fishing should be managed or banned in the Solomon Islands, where aggregations occur in multiple and often closely spaced localities, because heavy fishing pressure is likely to rapidly deplete them (Johannes and Kile 2001). Sex and size structure in spawning aggregation should be monitored where fishing on spawning aggregations occurs.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on soft substrates in shallow coastal waters at depths of 0–10 m. The species was only recently described based on 80 specimens, and it is likely that the Spadenose Guitarfish is captured and misidentified as its regional congener, the Shovelnose Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos </em>productus). Thus, based on the catches and trends of the Shovelnose Guitarfish, the Spadenose Guitarfish is targeted by artisanal elasmobranch fisheries and taken as bycatch by commercial demersal trawls and gillnets, and retained for its meat and fins. There are no population trend data, however Mexican fisheries logbook data suggest fluctuating catches of all guitarfishes combined from 2007 to 2014 despite suspected stable effort. Declines have been noted in other species of sharks and rays in the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries and declines in guitarfishes are also likely. The actual levels of exploitation are high across the known spatial and depth range of the Spadenose Guitarfish, and it has no refuge from unmanaged fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Spadenose Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Spadenose Guitarfish is demersal in sandy and muddy substrates in inshore shallow coastal waters at depths of 0–10 m (Rutledge 2109). It reaches a maximum size of at least 68.5 cm total length (TL) with the smallest adult male observed at 48 cm TL and female size-at-maturity unknown (Rutledge 2019). Reproduction is viviparous, like all guitarfishes, but nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are inferred from the Shovelnose Guitarfish that has a female age-at-maturity of 7 years and a maximum age of 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Timmons and Bray 1997).","This species is likely targeted along with the Shovelnose Guitarfish in artisanal elasmobranch fisheries in the Gulf of California and also retained as bycatch by demersal trawls and gillnets (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2016). These fisheries are intense, unmanaged, have been operating for more than the past five decades, and are dominated by artisanal fisheries that account for ~97% of the fleet (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017, Pollom <em>et al</em>. 2020a, Pollom <em>et al</em>. 2020b). It is estimated that 85% of the Gulf of California (GoC) fisheries are overexploited or at their maximum sustainable yield, with 937 large fishing vessels and more than 12,500 small fishing vessels (pangas) operating in the GoC (Munguia-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many shark species have been overfished which has possibly shifted effort towards coastal rays (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Shovelnose Guitarfish, and possibly also the Spadenose Guitarfish, are the most commonly seasonally landed elasmobranch species in the artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of California (Márquez-Farias 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, catch data reported as the Shovelnose Guitarfish may also include catches of Banded Guitarfish (<em>Zapteryx exasperata</em>). The landings of the Shovelnose Guitarfish and possibly the Spadenose Guitarfish, are mainly of gravid females, particularly in the summer (Márquez-Farias 2002, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009). Mature individuals are most susceptible to capture in the gillnet fisheries with neonates and juveniles captured less frequently (Márquez-Farías 2005, Márquez-Farías 2011).<br/><br/>The high catches of mature individuals in the target artisanal fisheries and as bycatch are likely affecting the population structure and possibly the population abundance of Shovelnose Guitarfish, and possibly the Spadenose Guitarfish (Márquez-Farías 2011). In San Felipe, Mexico, guitarfish species made up over 22% of elasmobranch bycatch in the commercial teleost trawl fishery (Godínez-Padilla and Castillo-Geniz 2016). Landings of guitarfish have been increasing in the southern Gulf of California multi-species artisanal fishery (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2016) where there is little management in place (Pollom <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>This species’ occurrence in inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat modification. Many embayments and estuaries in the northwest Pacific region of Mexico are being modified for shrimp farming (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span>","There are no population trend data available for this species. The species was only recently described based on 80 specimens collected from the 1940s until 1961 (Rutledge 2019). However, it is likely that the Spadenose Guitarfish is captured and misidentified as the Shovelnose Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos productus</em>) (Rutledge 2019). Thus, information for the Shovelnose Guitarfish can be inferred to represent that of the Spadenose Guitarfish.<br/><br/>In Mexican logbooks from fisheries targeting elasmobranchs, guitarfish species are combined and reported catches from 2007 to 2014 fluctuated from 846 t to &gt;1,000 t live weight (CONAPESCA 2006–2014). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to ascertain, particularly for artisanal fisheries (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017), but effort is estimated to be relatively stable (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2016). Declines in pelagic sharks and rays, and in a range of coastal shark species have been recorded in the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries (Sala <em>et al</em>. 2004, Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 2017), and declines in guitarfishes are also likely.<br/><br/>Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across the entire known spatial and depth range of the Spadenose Guitarfish, and it has no refuge from unmanaged fishing pressure. Declines in other sharks and rays in the Gulf of California fisheries have occurred, and it is likely there have also been declines in this species. It is suspected that the Spadenose Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations (27 years) due to levels of exploitation.<br/><strong></strong>",Decreasing,The Spadenose Guitarfish is endemic to the Gulf of California from San Felipe to Loreto in the Eastern Central Pacific Ocean (Rutledge 2019).,"There is no use or trade information for this species but its close relative and regional congener, the Shovelnose Guitarfish, is used for its meat and fins (Farrugia <em>et al</em>. 2016), and it is likely this species is also used for the meat and fins.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for the Spadenose Guitarfish.

In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Santana&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al. </em>2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). Gillnets are prevalent and target elasmobranchs (Chiaramonte 1998, Colautti <em>et al. </em>2010), and this is one of the most valued species in Buenos Aires Province (J-M. Cuevas unpubl. data 2018). This inshore eagle ray is exposed to intense and often unmanaged fishing pressure throughout the Atlantic South American portion of its range, and it has no refuge at depth.","In the northwest Atlantic, population trend data are available from data in a deepwater trawl survey (A.G. Pollack,&#160;NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Centre, Mississippi Laboratories unpubl. data 2019). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al. </em>2018, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). Data from time series in the Gulf of Mexico suggests steep increases in abundance over the length of the time-series (2002–2013). The probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category over three generations was Least Concern. In Atlantic South America, there are very few time-series of abundance. In Venezuela there are no data,  but this species is captured in large numbers in artisanal fisheries  there, which lack management (Mendoza 2015). The situation is suspected to be similar  in the Guianas. In northwestern Brazil, fishing pressure is intense and other elasmobranchs have been depleted there, and it is suspected that these fisheries are leading to a reduction in population size in that area.

The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line, and is retained in Taiwan, and likely China, for fish meal. If discarded elsewhere, post-release survival is likely low. There are no species-specific population trends, although it is considered common in Taiwan where the observed landing rates have remained stable for the past 10–15 years (two to three generation lengths). Landings data of all skates combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 23–68% over the past three generation lengths (15 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Significant habitat loss is also a threat to this species. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, may provide the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is inferred that the Japanese Sleeper Ray has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Japanese Sleeper Ray is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 12–140 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 37 cm total length (TL); males and females mature at 20 cm TL (Lin 2008). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 1–9, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 8 cm TL (Lin 2008, Last et al. 2016). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown and lacking for all sleeper rays. Ages are inferred from the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Japanese Sleeper Ray (75 vs 37 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Japanese Sleeper Ray. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line. It is retained in Taiwan, and likely China, for fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). If discarded in Japan and Korea, post-release survival is likely low, as they are soft-bodied and easily damaged.<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Japanese Sleeper Ray. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al</em>. 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). Since the 1980s, bottom trawls are the dominant gear followed by purse seines and small-scale gear (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In response to the fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of young people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019).<br/><br/>Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).","This species is considered common and abundant in Taiwan (Lin 2008, Lin 2010), with little change in its abundance observed at landing sites over the past 10–15 years (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), although no concurrent effort data is available to infer a Taiwan species-specific population trend. In Japan, it is also considered common (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, another source of information on long-term ray population trends are landings data that are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao et al. 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (15 years) of the Japanese Sleeper Ray, they represent declines of 39%, 65%, 23%, and 68% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.<br/><br/>Inferred declines of all elasmobranchs over three generation lengths (15 years) range from 23–68%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Japanese Sleeper Ray, with no areas of refuge from fishing pressure. However, the abundance at landing sites has changed little over the last 2–3 generation lengths in Taiwan (10–15 years) and seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. The species is also threatened by a decline in habitat quality. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (15 years).",Decreasing,"The Japanese Sleeper Ray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific where it is found from Japan to China, including South Korea and Taiwan (Zhu and Meng 2001, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).","This species is generally not used for human consumption as there is very little meat on the animal. In China and Taiwan, it is retained and sometimes discarded at the markets and sometimes used for fish meal (J. Zhang and H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"No specific conservation measures are in place. Since the late 1990s, Chinese regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12°N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>There are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019a) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km², are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon et al. 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, there are ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).<br/><br/>Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Japanese Sleeper Ray, and catch rates should be monitored.","",,false,false,Global

It is a large, slow-growing species with an estimated generation length of 22 years. The Silvertip Shark is subjected to high bycatch levels in high seas fisheries and in artisanal longline, gillnet, and trawl fisheries throughout its range, with its meat and fins marketable. Surveys of fish markets in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea suggest that the Silvertip Shark has undergone large declines in those waters. There is evidence that Indonesian fisheries have considerably reduced the numbers of the Silvertip Shark within the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] 1974 Box in the Timor Sea. Catches of sharks in this area declined throughout the early 1990s to the level that Indonesian shark fishing vessels have become relatively uncommon. In the Indian Ocean there was an estimated decline in the abundance of several reef shark species (including the Silvertip Shark) of over 90% in the period between 1970 and 2006 and around the US Pacific Islands common reef sharks have declined to 3-10% of baseline levels. This species' site-specificity, patchy population, and life history characteristics indicate that remote populations that are not currently managed are highly susceptible to depletion from direct shark fisheries and illegal practices. This information, combined with actual and potential levels of exploitation throughout its range results in a global assessment of Vulnerable, based on suspected overall population decline of greater than 30% over three generations (66 years) inferred from survey data. This assessment should be revisited when reliable catch data become available. In Australia, catch and survey data from the Great Barrier Reef suggest that this species is fairly common. The Silky Shark has limited interaction with fisheries operating in tropical Queensland and the Northern Territory an therefore, the species is listed as Least Concern in the regional Australian assessment.<br/></p>  <p></p>","The Silvertip Shark occurs on the continental shelf, offshore islands, coral reefs, and offshore banks, from surface waters to depths of 600-800 m (Compagno <em>et al. </em>2005). It is also found inside lagoons, near drop-offs, and offshore (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;The species appears to be relatively site-specific for long periods with limited dispersion, particularly at remote and isolated coral reef habitats around tropical islands or atolls (Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Espinoza&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). On the continental shelf, larger individuals of the species tend to be more mobile and use larger areas than other common reef shark species (Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Espinoza&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The Silvertip Shark also exhibits strong diel behaviour, moving closer to coral reefs and using shallower habitats at night.<br/><br/>Reproduction is viviparous, with a yolk sac placenta (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005, White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White 2007). Females give birth to 1-11 pups per litter (average six) biennially, after a 12 month gestation period (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 2005, White<em> et al.</em> 2006,&#160;Last and Stevens 2009). Size at birth is reported at 63-68 cm total length (TL) (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005) and 73-81 cm TL (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Young are found in shallow water closer to shore, whereas adults are more wide-ranging (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;Compagno <em>et al</em>. (2005) report that males mature at 160-180 cm TL and females at 160-199 cm TL. White <em>et al.</em> (2006) report that males mature at 190-200 cm TL and females at ~195 cm TL.&#160;Growth appears to be fairly slow at about 9 cm per year for juveniles (Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 300 cm TL (Compagno&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). No estimate of generation length is available for the species, although it can be inferred from its congener, the Pigeye Shark (<em>C. amboinensis</em>), which has a similar maximum size and an estimated generation length of 21.5 years (Tillett<em> et al</em>. 2011).","The Silvertip Shark is a bycatch in high seas fisheries and in artisanal longline, gillnet, and trawl fisheries throughout its range. The number of pelagic sharks landed by fishing fleets in all oceans has increased in economic importance (Mejuto <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, catch statistics are generally not available (Holts 1988, Smith <em>et al</em>. 1998) and where they are, they are under-reported. The Silvertip Shark is one of the nine main species landed by high seas longline and net fleets. The majority of these fleets target tunas in all of the world's oceans and as a result have a large bycatch of pelagic sharks (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005); for example, the species is a known bycatch of western Pacific tuna fleets (Ward <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Silvertip Shark was not considered in Clarke <em>et al</em>.'s (2006a) analysis of the global shark fin trade, although fins of the species have been identified in the trade (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006b).<br/><br/>Coral reef-associated species such as the Silvertip Shark are important to fisheries in Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the Maldives, and Chagos Archipelago (500 km south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean), where reefs dominate coastal habitats (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). In this region elasmobranchs are most commonly taken as bycatch in non-target fisheries or catchall artisanal fisheries (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Finning and discarding of carcasses has been reported, especially in offshore and high seas fisheries targeting tuna (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). The Silvertip Shark from the Chagos Archipelago is taken by the Mauritian Inshore Fishery, which targets grouper (subfamily Epinephelinae) and the Deepwater Snapper (<em>Etelis carbunculus</em>) and has operated in these waters since the early 1970s (Mees 1996). There is also an open-water fishery targeting tuna that commonly catches reef-associated sharks incidentally (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). Despite conservation measures in place in the Chagos Archipelago (see the <em>Conservation</em> section), illegal fishing is suspected to be a common activity in remote locations.<br/><br/>The Silvertip Shark is landed in local markets in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, and the Philippines (Kumoru 2003, SEAFDEC 2006, White 2007). In the Philippines, it is in the top 10 most landed species by number (0.73%) and weight (2.6%) with individuals ranging in size from 210-240 cm TL and averaging 23 kg in weight (SEAFDEC 2006). In Papua New Guinea, the Silvertip Shark was taken in the longline shark fishery that operated close to seamounts and non-emergent reefs (Kumoru 2003). Based on observer data, the Silky Shark (<em>C. falciformis</em>) and the Oceanic Whitetip Shark (<em>C. longimanus</em>) dominated the shark catch (58%), but the Silvertip Shark (6.2%) was also taken in significant numbers (Kumoru 2003). Most Silvertip Shark individuals caught in this fishery were retained (88%) and the fins and meat marketable (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the Western and Central Pacifc Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark.<br/><br/>There is evidence from northern Australia that finning can cause localised depletion of shark populations. Remote populations of Silky Shark are likely highly sensitive to target fisheries for meat or fins, particularly given their limited dispersal and localised movement patterns (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Acoustic and baited camera survey techniques were used to census shark abundance at two northern Australian reefs: Mermaid Reef in Rowley Shoals (a Commonwealth Marine Protected Area closed to all fishing) and Scott Reef (within the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] 1974 Box in the Timor Sea, where access by Indonesian fishers using traditional artisanal fishing techniques is permitted). Shark abundance was an order of magnitude higher on Mermaid Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). The Silvertip Shark, the main target of shark finning fleets in this area, was common on Mermaid Reef and absent at Scott Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). Fishing pressure is the most plausible explanation for differences in the composition and abundance of shark assemblages between Mermaid and Scott Reefs. Sharks preferentially targeted by fishermen, such as hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna</em> spp.) and the Silvertip Shark were absent from counts at Scott Reef. Furthermore, catches of reef sharks in the local area (MOU74 Box) declined throughout the early 1990s to the point that Indonesian shark fishing vessels have become relatively uncommon in this area (Wallner and McLoughlin 1996, Fox and Sen 2002, Ruppert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Several initiatives are underway to identify which species are being taken and in what quantities.<br/><br/>In the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia, the Silvertip Shark is not targeted by fisheries, but very low numbers are taken incidentally by commercial and recreational line fisheries that target Coral Trout (<em>Plectropomus leopardus</em>; Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009). This may be a result of its strong diel and foraging behaviours around coral reefs at night when little fishing activity occurs (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2015). Conversely, poor reporting of species-specific shark landings may occur (Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009), a common pattern observed in many fisheries where untargeted elasmobranch bycatch typically goes unidentified and/or unreported (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2002). In addition, although most of the shark catch associated with the Coral Trout line fishery is not retained, sharks that interact with line fisheries may break off before landing or are released bearing hooks and traces, and it is unclear how this may affect the health and survival of Silvertip Sharks (Gallagher <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, catch-per-unit effort data from the period between 1989 and 2006 showed no evidence of increase or decline of sharks associated with the line fishery along the GBR (Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Silvertip Shark is not known to interact with the inshore gillnet fishery that operates in Queensland waters (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>A ten-year survey (2000–2010) using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire GBR showed that the Silvertip Shark was the second most commonly sighted species (12.2%) (Espinoza et al. 2014). This survey showed that the species is restricted to offshore coral reef habitats in the GBR. An examination of the GBR Marine Park Zoning showed higher abundances of the Silvertip Shark in reefs that were closed to fishing. Moreover, higher abundances of the species were observed in protected areas that had more and healthier coral cover, suggesting that the loss and degradation of coral reefs may negatively affect their populations (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014). BRUVS data from 2004-2010 suggest that the abundance of the Silvertip Shark has not changed since the new re-zoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004, despite an increase in the coverage of protected areas (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>The Silvertip Shark population appears to be fragmented, with apparently low potential for interchange between localised stocks. Surveys of fish markets in Indonesia and Papua Guinea suggest that the Silvertip Shark has undergone large population declines in those waters (W. White, CSIRO, 02/2015, pers. comm). For example, a five-year survey of Indonesian fish landing sites only found 95 Silvertip Shark individuals out of a total of more than 21,000 sharks recorded (White 2007). Based on diving survey data, Graham <em>et al</em>. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks observed per dive in Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a decline of over 90% across 36 years. Species-specific data only included the period from 1996 to 2006, in which the mean number of the Silvertip Shark observed per dive actually increased from 0.03 sharks per dive to 0.12 (Graham <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, underwater surveys conducted between 2004 and 2010 across a much broader area of the Central Western Pacific Ocean, that is, around 46 United States Pacific Islands, estimated that common reef sharks have declined to 3-10% of baseline levels around inhabited islands (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2012). Baseline was considered to be the absence of humans (Nadon et al. 2012) and theoretically could be considered to be at least three generation lengths of Silvertip Sharks (66 years). Given this large decline in the abundance of reef shark species around inhabited islands and the high exploitation levels from fisheries operating in the Indo-Pacific region, it is suspected that the Silvertip Shark have experienced population reductions of more than 30% across the Indo-Pacific Ocean over three generations.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Silvertip Shark has a tropical Indo-Pacific distribution that is wide-ranging but fragmented (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Western Indian Ocean, the Silvertip Shark occurs in the Red Sea, off South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Madagascar, Aldabra Islands, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Chagos Archipelago (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Western Central Pacific, it occurs off Indonesia, Taiwan, Guam, New Caledonia, Philippines, Palau, Marshall, Solomon and Phoenix Islands, Tahiti, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). It also occurs in northern Australian waters from Carnarvon (Western Australia) to Bundaberg (Queensland), except for the Gulf of Carpentaria and Arafura Sea (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1991, MIRC 2007, Last and Stevens 2009). In the Eastern Central Pacific, the Silvertip Shark is known from southern Baja California, south to Guatemala and Colombia, including the Revillagigedo and Clipperton Islands, Cocos Island and Galápagos Islands (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species possibly also occurs in the Western Central Atlantic (Mexico, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea; Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013), although its presence in that region is unconfirmed (Grace 2001).<br/></p>","The Silvertip Shark is utilized for its fins, meat, cartilage, liver, teeth, jaws, and skin (SEAFDEC 2006).&#160;The meat, teeth, and jaws are generally sold locally, whereas fins, skin, and cartilage are generally exported.",Marine,"<p>Currently there are no species-specific management measures in place.&#160;In the Chagos Archipelago, since 2006 all fishing vessels were required to report shark bycatch, finning practices were banned, and the use of wire trace was prohibited. There was also a British Indian Ocean Patrol Vessel patrolling this Archipelago to detect illegal shark fisheries, mainly from Sri Lanka (Anderson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998). However, illegal fisheries still operate in these areas as these measures are largely unenforced. Catch levels should be quantified and monitored throughout the range of the species. Silvertip Shark populations in isolated coral reef habitats subject to fishing pressure may benefit from creation of Marine Protected Areas, because their limited dispersal from those habitats likely makes them more susceptible to depletion (Compagno&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Barnett <em>et al.</em> 2012). Enforcement of regulations related to fisheries catch and landings, such as finning regulations and size limits, would be the most beneficial conservation measure for the species.  </p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
205782570,39370,Carcharhinus falciformis,Vulnerable,A2bd,2021,2017-09-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Silky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus falciformis</em>) is an oceanic and coastal-pelagic shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical waters. It is a target or bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries where it is taken in high numbers. Silky Shark is one of the three most traded shark species in the global shark fin trade. Estimates of trends in abundance over three generations (45 years) from standardized catch rate and spawning biomass indices show declines of Silky Shark in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean, Western Central Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. Across all three ocean regions, there are the major uncertainties in estimates of catch rate and population changes, and an inability to conclusively attribute any declines solely to fishing mortality as there is some potential for environmental influences on catchability and sampling artefacts. The weighted global population trend estimated a 47-54% decline over three generations. This reflects the proportionate contribution of each region’s Silky Shark population change. The estimated level of decline and the uncertainties in the data warrants a global status of Vulnerable. This assessment should be revisited when more definitive catch data and stock assessments become available.<br/></p>  <p></p>","The Silky Shark is a circumtropical oceanic and coastal-pelagic species. It is most often found near the edge of continental and insular shelves at depths of 200 m or more in the epipelagic zone although it occurs from the surface to a depth of at least 500 m offshore (Last and Stevens 2009). It is often associated with islands, near insular slopes and over deepwater reefs preferring warmer waters (about 23°C). Smaller sharks are often found in coastal nurseries and adults further offshore over deeper water. In pelagic habitats, the Silky Shark is often associated with drifting materials on the surface (Filmalter <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Silky Shark generally leaves coastal nursery grounds and moves offshore to oceanic waters as sub-adults, frequently joining tuna schools on which they seem to feed (Branstetter 1987). Ontogenetic diet shifts occur from lower trophic position to higher trophic positions as the Silky Shark matures (Rabehagasoa <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>The Silky Shark gives birth to live young, averaging 5-7 pups per litter with a range of 2-18 pups per litter (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Size at birth ranges from 65-81 cm total length (TL) and the gestation period ranges from 9-12 months depending on location and study (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Fecundity increases with increasing size of females and females give birth every year, every two years, or sometime in between (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Life history parameters vary considerably among regions (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2105a). &#160;Maximum size varies from 229-371 cm TL and size at maturity from 180-230 cm TL for males and 180-246 cm TL for females. Age at maturity ranges from 5-13 years for males and 6-15 years for females with maximum ages of 8-28.6 years for males and 11-35.8 years for females. Generation length is estimated to be 15 years based on the average age of maturity of females as 9 years old and average maximum age of 21 years old (excluding outliers). This is in close agreement with generation length of 16 years in Dulvy <em>et al.</em> (2008).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Off the west coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico in the Eastern Central Pacific, maximum size was 316 cm TL and size at maturity of males and females was 180-182 cm (Hoyos-Padilla <em>et al.</em> 2012, Galvan-Tirado <em>et al.</em> 2015). Both males and females were found to mature at 7-8 years old with a maximum age of 14 and 16 years observed for the sampled males and females, respectively (Sanchez-de Ita <em>et al.</em> 2011). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico, maximum size was 229 cm TL and was smaller than the maximum size found in more open Mexican waters (Galvan-Tirado <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Japanese tuna longline and purse seine fisheries data from across the entire Pacific Ocean indicated a maximum size of 288 cm TL. Males were mature at 180-187 cm TL and 5-6 years, and females at 193-200 cm TL and 6-7 years. Maximum age observed was 8 years for males and 13 years for females (Oshitani <em>et al.</em> 2003). In northeast Taiwan, maximum size was 332 cm TL. Males were mature at 213 cm TL and 9.3 years and females at 210-220 cm TL and 9.2-10.2 years. Maximum age was observed at 14 years for males and 11 years for females with a theoretical maximum age estimated as 28.6 year for males and 35.8 years for females (Joung <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean<br/></strong>In eastern Indonesia, Indian Ocean, the maximum size was 242 cm TL for males and 263 cm TL for females (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012). Males were estimated to mature at 208 cm TL and at an age of 13 years (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012). Females matured at 216 cm TL and 15 years of age and reached a maximum size of 263 cm TL (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012). Males and females were estimated to have a maximum age of 20 and 19 years, respectively (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012). <br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>Silky Shark grow larger and mature at later sizes in the northwest Atlantic than in the Eastern Pacific and Western Central Pacific (Bonfil 2008). In the Gulf of Mexico, maximum size was recently reported as 371 cm TL (Serafy <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, males were mature at 215-225 cm TL and 6-10 years, and females at 232-246 cm and 7-12 years (Branstetter 1987, Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 1993, Bonfil 2008). Maximum age was estimated as at least 22 years (Bonfil 1990). In the southeast United States, females have been estimated to mature at 8 years and reach a maximum age of 27 years (Chen and Yuan 2006). Two studies from the equatorial Atlantic report differences in sizes at maturity that varied from 180-200 cm to 210-230 cm TL for males and from 230 cm to 205-210 cm TL for females (Hazin <em>et al.</em> 2007, Lana 2012).","The Silky Shark is the second most caught species of shark globally, after the Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Silky Shark is both targeted or caught as incidental (bycatch) by longline fisheries and purse seine fisheries (especially those using drifting fish aggregating devices [FADs]) as well as by artisanal fisheries. FADs are made of a floating object and nets that lie vertical in the water column to attract schools of fish. The Silky Shark, as well as other species, is easily entangled in the nets; and there have been large increases in the use of FADs since 1996 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). Whether they are targeted or an incidental catch, the Silky Shark is often either retained for its meat and fins where regulations allow, or released with high mortality rates apparent in the tropical purse seine fisheries (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Total catches of the Silky Shark reported to FAO are mainly from Sri Lanka (Western Indian Ocean) with the FAO catch less than 4,000 tonnes (t) from 2005-2009 before doubling in 2010 and 2011. Catches then decreased to ~5,000 t in 2012 and 2013 (FAO 2015).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark was found to represent at least 3-4% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading centre—the third highest after Blue Shark and Hammerhead Shark (general) (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006a)—and Hong Kong is thought to make up more than half of the global shark fin trade (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006b). Silky Shark fins are valuable to the trade, although they are not one of the highest value fin types (S. Clarke, unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The Silky Shark is taken in pelagic commercial fisheries in the eastern central and southeast Pacific, as well as in coastal artisanal fisheries of the region. Fishing pressure from longline and purse seine fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is high, and it is the main shark species caught in fisheries using FADs as well as longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 2015). In addition to mortality, FADs may be influencing behaviour of the Silky Shark. In the eastern Pacific, Silky Shark diet contained high proportions of FAD-associated prey items, probably due to the increasing likelihood of an encounter with prey items at FADs (Duffy <em>et al</em>. 2015). If this behaviour continues, Silky Shark may be increasingly attracted to FADs and fishing mortality may be increased.<br/><br/>Mexico contributed the most to catch of the Silky Shark in the north and southeast Pacific, catching up to 40% of the total catch (12-16,000 t in the north and 11-16,000 t in the south per year) (IATTC 2013). The IATTC observer database from 1993-2005 showed that the Silky Shark was caught throughout the ocean west of central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru out to about 170°W on purse seines set on FADs. The Silky Shark was the most commonly caught species of shark in the purse seine fishery for tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean (IATTC 2007). The fishery has largely increased the use of FADs, which the Silky Shark is attracted to, increasing the catch rate of the Silky Shark in the fishery (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, it is mainly juveniles caught North of the equator and caught in FAD sets.<br/><br/>Reported catches of the Silky Shark are approximately four times higher north of the equator in the purse seine fleets (IATTC 2013). In the north, 30-45,000 individuals were caught each year (2006-2010), while in the south, &lt;10,000 individuals were caught each year (IATTC 2013). In the longline sector of the IATTC, annual catches of the Silky Shark ranged from 20-60,000 individuals in the north to 10-30,000 individuals in the south. Catches of the Silky Shark in waters around Mexico have been steadily increasing from the late 1970s, when over 3,000 t were caught to the 2000s, when 6-7,000 t of Silky Shark was caught (IATTC 2013). Central American unreported catch was estimated to be similar to the catch in Mexico of 6-7,000 sharks in recent years (IATTC 2013).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark are a major component of the shark catch in many fisheries along the Pacific coast of Central America. Observations made on a longline research vessel that sampled waters in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala found that Silky Shark constituted 31%, 47% and 29% of the total catch respectively, and 80%, 63% and 44% of the shark catch respectively (Porras 1996). Off Chiapas, southern Mexico, Silky Shark (along with Scalloped Hammerhead, <em>Sphyrna lewini</em>) form the large bulk of the shark catch (Soriano-Velásquez and Acal Sánchez 2008). In Tres Marías Islands, Mexico, Silky Shark is a major part of the catch constituting 27% of landed sharks in 1996 (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005). In San José and Buena Vista, Guatemala, Silky Shark constituted 73% of recorded catches landed, in a sample of 4,211 sharks, from 1996 to 1999 (Ruiz and Ixquiac 2000).<br/><br/>International longline vessels operating in the eastern central Pacific landed and exported over 8,000 t of shark carcasses and 900 t of shark fins from Costa Rica in 2002 (Costa Rica official INCOPESCA Fishery Statistics 2003), the large majority of which were recorded as the Silky Shark. However, these figures must be interpreted with caution as other sharks may have been misidentified as the Silky Shark. International vessels are known to transship shark products on the high seas, meaning these shipments are unreported. In 1991 in Costa Rica, sharks formed 27% of the total catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 2000, only 8% of the total catch was sharks, 71% of which were Silky Shark. In 2003, the proportion of sharks in the total catch decreased further to 5% of the total catch, the Silky Shark made up 58% of the shark catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Costa Rican longline fishery, most of the Silky Shark catch is composed of juveniles. Since 2004, adults made up less than 15% of the Silky Shark catch (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the total length of individuals caught decreased significantly from 2004 and 2007 to 2008-2010, indicating a decrease in spawning stock biomass (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Manta (the largest fishing port in Ecuador), artisanal fisheries data from September 2003 to the end of 2006 showed over 22,000 Silky Shark were caught (J. Martínez pers. comm. Feb. 2007). From 2008-2012, over 137, 000 individuals were caught throughout Ecuador which is six times the amount of the previous four years (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2015). The landed females ranged in length from 61-309 cm TL, and the males ranged in length from 63-288 cm TL. In terms of landed weight of the Silky Shark, in Ecuador in the early 2000s, less than 400 t were landed annually, and from 2007-2011, 900-1,300 t per year were landed (IATTC 2013). Catch records from 2007-2008 for nine ports in Ecuador show that catches of Silky Shark was highest in the warmer summer months from March-August (IATTC 2011). Individuals landed were mainly 114-246 cm TL for females and 101-233 cm TL for males with a peak at 160 cm TL for both sexes (IATTC 2011). This peak corresponds to immature individuals, therefore, a majority of the Silky Shark landed in Ecuador is immature.<br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The tropical waters of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) currently support the largest industrial tuna fishery in the world with an annual tuna catch approaching one million tonnes. The two main gear types, longline and purse seine, accounted for over 90% of the target tuna catch in this area in 1999 (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species found in the longline fishery are Silky Shark, Blue Shark, Pelagic Stingray (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>), and the Oceanic Whitetip (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>) (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species in the purse seine fishery is Silky Shark accounting for 95% of the elasmobranch bycatch in the FAD-associated purse seiners (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Due to the high rate of exploitation in the Indo-Pacific, the Silky Shark population is at risk of genetic diversity loss (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<br/><br/>In the WCPO, the longline fishery catches the highest number of Silky Shark with the estimated catch (based on observer data) in 2009 of 189,000 individuals compared to 69,790 individual Silky Shark taken in the same year for the purse seine fishery (Lawson 2011). Once brailed from purse seines, Silky Shark have been shown to be deceased 72% of the time when brought on board (Poisson <em>et al</em>. 2014). They have also been shown in the WCPO purse seine fishery to have a high post-release mortality of greater than 84% (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the WCPO, longlines and purse seines mainly catch juveniles (Rice and Harley 2013). In the western Pacific, a CPUE for Silky Shark of 1-25 kg per set was found on purse seine sets on tuna schools unassociated with FADs from 1998-2010 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). On purse seine sets on anchored FADs, the CPUE from 1998-2010 was between 5-50 kg per set and on drifting FADs, the CPUE was 25-60 kg per set (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In pelagic longlines based off Hawaii, Silky Shark is caught mainly on deep sea sets. Most of the Silky Shark catch (62.5%) was taken above the equator (0° to 10°N), even though only 3% of fishing was observed above the equator (Walsh and Clarke 2011).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, reported catches of Silky Shark increased by 1,058 t from 2003-2011 (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). This may be due to better reporting. Malaysia does not report catches but does list Silky Shark as a commercial species that is used for fins and meat. Silky Shark is sold locally in Malaysia and prices have been increasing (Lack and Sant 2012). Similarly, Vietnam has no data available on the amount of Silky Shark caught, but it is included in catch reports of sharks (Lack and Sant 2012). In Thailand, Silky Shark is noted as being caught at a “normal” amount, however, there is little training for fisheries officers in identification. This may account for an underestimation of Silky Shark catch (Krajangdara 2014).<br/><br/>Papua New Guinea had a coastal longline shark fishery in which Silky Shark made up &gt;50% of the shark catch (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the WCPFC requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark (see the <em>Conservation</em> section). Over 765 t of Silky Shark was caught in 2001. In 2011, 72% of sharks caught on longlines was Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). The proportion of Silky Shark in the shark longline catch was &gt;50% through 2013-mid 2014 (Jonathan Smart, pers. comms 2015). In the Solomon Islands, Silky Shark accounted for 23% of all longline bycatch and 84% of purse seine bycatch (in data collated in 2009; Lack and Meere 2009). The meat is kept for local subsistence and fins are exported. As of 2006, all fin exporters had to be licensed which increased the reliability of reported catches (McCoy 2006). In Fiji, Silky Shark accounted for 13% of longline bycatch and was caught in low levels in the purse seine fishery (2009 collated data; Lack and Meere 2009).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is a very common component of shark and tuna longline and tuna gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (Pacific and Indian Oceans) (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia’s reported shark catch represents 13% of the global total shark catch. Of this, 15% were reported as Silky Shark from 2001-2004. This represents an average annual catch of 15,943 t of Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). Since 2009, a National Plan of Action-Sharks (NPOA) in Indonesia has been implemented and Silky Shark is listed as a commercial species in the Indonesian NPOA (Lack and Sant 2012). Silky Shark is fished over its entire size range with larger individuals caught on longlines at the beginning of the season and smaller individuals caught in gillnets once the catch rate on longlines decreases (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is caught by Australian longline fisheries operating on both the east and west coasts, that is, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans respectively (Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2014). Due to management restrictions, total retained catch of sharks by these fisheries is low and Silky Shark is not a major of component of those that are retained. Overall effort on the west coast of Australia is low. Due to the spatial distribution of effort on the east coast (greatest between 25-30°S), few Silky Shark are captured. No assessment of Silky Shark has been undertaken by Australia (although the east coast fishery data was included in the WCPO Silky Shark stock assessment) (Rice and Harley 2013). Australia has a range of management measures in place to mitigate impacts on all sharks. These include trip limits of a maximum of 20 sharks, a ban on the use of wire traces and shark finning bans (Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese, and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). Sharks are targeted in several areas, including off India where they are captured using hook and line and in large mesh gillnets, which are among the world’s largest (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Silky Shark was the most commonly caught shark at FADs in the Indian Ocean during a small pilot study of observers onboard French vessels—61.5% of Silky Shark was discarded dead at sea, 30.5% partially alive kept onboard, ~7% discarded alive (Viera and Pianet 2006). In a more recent study of FADs in the Indian Ocean, it was estimated that 480,000-960,000 Silky Shark become entangled and subsequently die annually in Indian Ocean FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The number of Silky Shark that die by becoming entangled in the FADs was estimated as 5-10 times higher than the number estimated to be taken as bycatch in Indian Ocean FAD-associated purse seine sets (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sharks that were caught in FADs died and fell out within two days, therefore, there is the potential for very high levels of cryptic mortality on FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Indian Ocean, due to the high abundance of FADs, it was estimated a Silky Shark has a 29% chance of surviving to age 1, 9% chance of survival to 2 years, and only a 3% chance of survival to 3 years old (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Southwest coast of India, at Cochin, Silky Shark was recorded as a small portion of landed sharks through 2000-2002. In 2010, their contribution had increased to 16.3% of shark landings at Cochin (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, this increased contribution may partly be as a result of potential increase in reporting.<br/><br/>In the Maldives, it was estimated that some 85% of oceanic shark catch comprise Silky Shark (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). Although no specific data were available, Maldivian shark fishermen who specialize in longlining for oceanic sharks anecdotally reported declines in abundance and average size of Silky Shark; all fishers commented that Silky Shark numbers had decreased by &gt;50% in the past 20 years (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). A fishery for Silky Shark has operated off Sri Lanka for many years and Sri Lanka are one of the only countries to report species-specific Silky Shark catch to FAO. The Silky Shark reported landings have decreased in Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2011 by 2,798 t (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese fleet in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean longline fisheries is high and ongoing. In the United States, Silky Shark is caught by the commercial shark bottom longline and the pelagic longline fishery, and in recreational shark fisheries. In the shark bottom longline fishery in Gulf of Mexico and Southern Atlantic, Silky Shark represent a major by-product species (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Approximately 75% of individuals caught are retained, mainly comprising small individuals (&lt;110 cm TL). The rest are discarded, of which one third are discarded dead (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Silky Shark is one of the five most captured shark species caught in the Cuban longline fishery (Espinosa 2004).<br/><br/>Silky Shark is taken in several longline fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic, including those off Santos, southern Brazil (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Amorim <em>et al</em>. 1998), Natal, northeastern Brazil (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 1990) and Uruguay (Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is taken in artisanal gillnet fisheries off southern Paraná State (Costa and Chaves 2006). In Brazil, Silky Shark is generally retained and marketed (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). Silky Shark catch in the longline tuna fishery off Brazil increased from 2004-2008 and then declined from 2008-2010 (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). The highest catch rates occurred near the coast, with two exceptions in the central Atlantic. Similar to most catch data of Silky Shark, a high proportion of individuals were immature (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). In another part of the Atlantic, in Spain, the landings of Silky Shark plummeted in the early 2000s from 17 t in 2002 to ~1 t in 2011 (Eurostat 2013).","The Silky Shark population structure is poorly understood. Genetic studies found that in the Pacific, there are potentially three stocks; one stock in the western Pacific and two stocks in the eastern Pacific (north and south) separated by the equator (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, the degree of genetic separation is slight and may not be sufficient to consider them separate subpopulations. Population changes have been noted in all ocean regions but no population estimates are available.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Recent attempts have been made to assess the stocks from the eastern Pacific, although only indicators of population change could be used to infer changes in population due to major uncertainties in catch data from the early years of the time series (1994-1998) that hindered calculation of stock status (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). For the north eastern Pacific stock, standardised catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) estimates from the purse seine fishery on floating objects indicated an overall decline from 1994-2015 that included some periods of stability, a sharp decrease from 2010-2012 followed by a sharp increase from 2012-2015 (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). The cause of the changes from 2010 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2015 are unknown and may be partly due to changes in catchability, rather than abundance, because of environmental effects such as the El Niño events in 2010 and 2015 and La Niña events in 2011-2012 (Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). Additionally, in 1994 the spatial distribution of the purse seine fishery was much narrower compared to subsequent years (Aires da Silva 2014). Inclusion or exclusion of this first year of data makes a large difference to the estimate of CPUE decline over time. From 1994-2015 there was a decline of 32% (based on estimates from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). To estimate this decline over three generations (45 years), the CPUE data was extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. If 1994 is included, the estimated three generation decline is 60%; if 1994 is excluded, the estimated three generation decline is 17%.<br/><br/>For the southeast Pacific stock there was a sharp decline in standardised CPUE during 1994-2004 followed by stability up to 2013, an increase from 2013-2014 and little change in 2015 (Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). The estimate of decline in CPUE over the period 1994-2015 was 60% (based on Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016). Inclusion or exclusion of the 1994 does not make a difference to the estimate of three generation decline which is 99% (based on CPUE data extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error.<br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean<br/></strong>A stock assessment for the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) estimated that the 2009 fishing mortality of Silky Shark exceeded the fishing mortality producing maximum sustainable yield by over four times (Rice and Harley 2013). This level of fishing mortality is estimated to have depleted the total stock biomass by 70% from the theoretical virgin stock biomass and is indicative that overfishing has occurred (Rice and Harley 2013). Estimated spawning biomass declined by 33% from 1995-2009 (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimates of biomass declines are derived from the stock assessment model based on the standardised CPUE series which is mostly determined from WCPO observer data that has limitations of low spatial and patchy temporal coverage (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimated spawning biomass decline from the stock assessment was used to estimate a three generation change by extraction of the data from Figure 13, Rice and Harley 2013 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population decline of 86% over three generations was estimated. A more recent assessment of Silky Shark standardised CPUE in the WCPO extended the data series by five years from 1995 to 2014 and reported high inter-annual variability with an initial decline from 1995-2000 followed by a slight increase until 2010, followed by a steep decline (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015). As the CPUE trend is different to that used in the stock assessment in Rice and Harley 2013, the more recent CPUE data was also used to estimate a three-generation change. The CPUE data was extracted from Figure 37, Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population increase of 18% over three generations was estimated. The differences in CPUE data used in Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015 generated very different three-generation change outcomes, with the latter study emphasising the need for an updated stock assessment. At this stage, the three-generation change is taken as the mid-point of the two studies, that is a 34% decline, although this should be revisited when an updated stock assessment becomes available.<br/><br/>In Hawaii, the Silky Shark nominal CPUE had remained stable through 2000 to 2010, indicating a possible stable population in that region (Walsh and Clarke 2011). The Hawaii data represents approximately one third of WCPO Observer data but was not included in the 2015 standardised CPUE estimates as it was only available up to 2011 (Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015). A study from the tropical Central Pacific comparing 1950s and 1990s longline data estimated that the Silky Shark population had declined in abundance by 92% (Ward and Myers 2005). The reduction was likely attributed to the effects of fishing, although without a time-series index it was not possible to discount contributions of variations in oceanographic conditions and biases due to the different areas and gear sampled (Ward and Myers 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>In the Indian Ocean, there is no stock assessment or any reliable fishery indicators of status, therefore the stock status is highly uncertain (IOTC 2013, Lack <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>There is no stock assessment of the Silky Shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Analyses of longline research surveys and observer data from the Gulf of Mexico estimated that the abundance of the Silky Shark population had declined by 91% from 1950-1990 (Baum and Myers 2004). United States pelagic longline observer and logbook data (1992-2005) that encompasses both the northwest and western central Atlantic regions was used to estimate a decrease of 46 and 50% respectively in Silky Shark standardised CPUE (Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007). The observer and logbook standardised CPUE data was extracted from Figures 6B and 6A respectively; Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. Population reductions of 95% and 98% respectively were estimated over three generations. However, Cortes <em>et al</em>. (2007) also reported that relative abundance of Silky Shark appeared to be increasing in the area since 2000 and advised caution in interpreting the catch trends due to short-comings in the data and the highly migratory nature of the Silky Shark that requires a more comprehensive analysis of trends throughout their range. Another analyses of the observer data from this same fishery over 1992-2005 combined catches of Dusky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em>), Silky Shark, and Night Shark (<em>Carcharhinus signatus</em>), grouped because of identification problems, and reported that the standardized catch rates of this species complex were suspected to have declined by 76% (Baum and Blanchard 2010).<br/><br/>To estimate a global population trend, the three generation population trends estimated from standardized CPUE data for each region (and the spawning biomass from the WCPO) were weighted according to the relative size of each region’s surveyed area. This assumed that Silky Shark is evenly distributed throughout its surveyed range. For the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, the estimated declines in the north (60% and 17%; with and without 1994 data respectively) and the 99% decline for the south were used (based on Lennert-Cody <em>et al</em>. 2016 data); for the Western Central Pacific Ocean, a 34% decline was used (based on Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice <em>et al</em>. 2015); and in the Atlantic Ocean, as the three generation decline estimates from Cortés <em>et al</em>. 2007 data were so similar, the average of the two estimated declines was used, that is, 97%. The estimated weighted global population trend is a 47-54% decline over the equivalent of three generation spans. This is a best estimate based on the most reliable data currently available from each region. There are areas that have no reliable catch data, such as the Indian Ocean, which should be included in the future as data become available.<br/><p></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>  </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Silky Shark has a circumglobal distribution in tropical waters (Last and Stevens 2009). In the Western Atlantic it ranges from Massachusetts, USA, to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. The species is also found from St. Paul's Rocks in the Central Atlantic. In the Eastern Atlantic it ranges from Madeira, the Atlantic coast of Spain, and from Senegal to northern Angola. In the Indian Ocean, the species occurs off Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Comoros and Aldabra Island, also from Somalia to the Maldives, Oman, Red Sea, and Sri Lanka. In the Western Pacific, Silky Shark occurs off Thailand, Philippines, New Caledonia, China and Taiwan (Province of China). It also occurs around the Caroline Islands, Phoenix and Line Islands westwards. In the Eastern Pacific, the species ranges from Southern Baja California to Peru. It is also present around the Hawaiian Islands, Cocos Island, Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton and Malpelos Islands (Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998, Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>The meat of Silky Shark is used for human consumption, the fins are taken for the shark fin trade, the skin has been processed for leather and the liver has been used for liver oil (for its high vitamin A content in this species) <span lang=""EN-AU"">(Vannuccini 1999). </p>",Marine,"Silky Shark is a member of the family Carcharhinidae, which is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They were listed on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under Appendix II in 2014. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by 38 countries in 2010 for migratory sharks, and Silky Shark was added to the MOU in February 2016.<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is likely protected in the EEZs of countries that have banned all targeting of sharks in commercial fisheries operating in their waters. These countries include Palau, Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, the Marshall Islands, and the British Virgin Islands (Pew 2014). The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia, New Zealand), regional entities (EU) and all regional fisheries management organisations (e.g. ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) may discourage the capture of oceanic sharks for their fins, because most finning bans require that if fins are to be retained, they must remain attached to the carcass until landed.<br/><br/>Silky Shark retention bans are in place for all vessels operating under ICCAT and WCPFC management (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). Additionally, any Silky Shark that is brought on board must be released in the best condition possible and as quickly as possible. All interactions are recorded and the status upon release is recorded (alive or dead) (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). ICCAT has exemptions for developing countries that report the catch of Silky Shark, that have no increase in catch of Silky Shark and ensure that Silky Shark will not enter international trade (ICCAT 2011). The implementation of no retention policies for Silky Shark has likely allowed additional Silky Shark to be released, however Silky Shark have a high level of post-release mortality (&gt;84% in tropical tuna purse seines) and high level of hooking mortality (~56% on tropical longlines) (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015, Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2012). Post-release survival of Silky Shark was markedly improved in the US pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico when circle hooks became mandatory after August 2004. Survival increased from 41% in 1992-2004 to 56% in 2004-2010 (Serafy <em>et al</em>. 2012). IATTC has prohibited retention of Silky Sharks on purse seine vessels, limited longline vessel Silky Shark bycatch to a maximum of 20% by weight of total catch per fishing trip, and in multi-species fisheries that use surface longlines limited the catch of Silky Sharks that are less than 100 cm total length to 20% of the total number of Silky Sharks caught per trip (IATTC 2016). No management arrangements are in place for Silky Shark in the IOTC area (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Management of Silky Shark should focus on preventing capture and include small scale measures such as temporal and spatial closures as well as large scale regulations (Tolotti <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Eastern Pacific, significantly more juveniles are taken above the equator, and Watson (et al. 2009) concluded that larger closures above the equator would reduce the bycatch of Silky Shark of up to 33% while having &lt;10% effect on tuna catch. Smaller closures would have smaller effects on both Silky Shark catch and tuna catch, however, would still reduce juvenile fishing mortality (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Management of Silky Shark is made difficult by the limited knowledge of stock structure and migration patterns.<a name=""_Hlk492292829""></a>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
