505458,12137,Lithognathus lithognathus,Endangered,"A2bcd; B2ab(ii,v)",2014,2009-12-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The White Steenbras (<em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em>) is a slow-growing, long-lived, late maturing, and estuarine-dependent species endemic to South Africa. This species undertakes annual migrations where is it subject to targeted fishing effort at spawning aggregation sites. Estuaries are critical nursery habitats for <em>L. lithognathus </em>and&#160;juveniles are obligatory inhabitants of estuaries for up to three years.&#160;<em>Lithognathus lithognathus&#160;</em>is susceptible to fragmentation due to intrinsic characteristics such as strong site fidelity and a small home range. Furthermore, its estuarine habitat is extremely vulnerable to habitat degradation due to anthropogenic activities including infrastructural development, boating activities, freshwater abstraction and overfishing. These pose major threats to the shallow water and estuarine habitats that this species depends on and have profound impacts on recruitment, population size and structure.&#160;Spawning may be restricted to inshore areas off a few estuaries along the Transkei coast.&#160;While <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;is afforded some protection in several no-take MPAs throughout its range, the stock is regarded as collapsed and drastic management measures have been implemented in order to rebuild the stock. Despite the decommercialization of <em>L</em>.<em>&#160;lithognathus</em>, illegal fishing and non-compliance of minimum landing sizes still pose threats to this species. There are also continual efforts to lift the commercial ban that would almost certainly result in the complete collapse of the stock. CPUE trends and significant changes in relative contribution of this species to overall catch composition infer very substantial reductions in abundance across its distributional range.&#160;The current status of the stock is &lt;25% of&#160;the pristine biomass and is considered to be collapsed with spawner biomass per recruit of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;estimated at 6% of the pristine stock. Numbers have decreased an average of 55% estimated over a 36 year period (1951-1968, 1977-1987, 1983-1991) and landings have declined at a faster rate by an average of 83% over 36 years (1960-1991, 1991-1996) in the Southwestern Cape shore fishery. Moreover, current trajectories of exploitation and deleterious impacts to its estuarine habitat may indicate further population declines of this species. The estuaries inhabited by <em>L. lithognathus</em> juveniles range from the Berg Estuary on the Western Cape to Mbhanyana on the Eastern Cape coast which comprises <em>c.&#160;</em>146 km<sup>2 </sup>of estuary surface area. This species is therefore listed as Endangered under A2bcd; B2ab(ii,v) based on population declines in excess of 55% extrapolated over three generations (=39 years), an AOO of 146 km<sup>2</sup>, the&#160;continuing decline of mature individuals and area of occupancy, and under five threat based locations.&#160;<br/><br/>Recommended conservation measures include: additional marine/estuarine protected areas, a closed fishing season, MPA angling closures, improvement in law enforcement and compliance, and reduction in illegal fishing in spawning grounds. A network of estuarine protected areas and the establishment of no-take areas in the sandy lower reaches of estuaries is recommended to aid the protection of juveniles. We further recommend continued monitoring of the status of its population and estuarine habitat. Importantly, the population of this species needs to be closely monitored as further population declines may warrant listing in a higher extinction risk threshold in the next five years.","<em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em>&#160;has specific and restricted distributional ranges for each its life stages (i.e. estuarine juvenile, post-estuarine sub-adults and adult). Adults of this species inhabit inshore marine environments to 25 m depth (Bennett 2012), usually over sandy or mixed sand and rock shorelines (Smith and Smith 1986; Bennett 1991, 1993; P.D. Cowley, South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, unpublished data). Juveniles have an obligatory estuarine-dependent nursery phase (Wallace <em>et al.</em>&#160;1984)&#160;where they inhabit estuaries for up to two to three years (Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Bennett 2012) with high site fidelity (Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Late juveniles up to 40 cm FL inhabit the surf zone&#160;(Cowley 1999, Bennett 2012) while late juveniles/sub-adults (40 cm to 50 cm FL) are semi-resident in the surf zone and exhibit some nomadic movement up to 400 km (Bennett 1993, 2012). Some individuals &gt;50cm begin to under take large scale migrations while the majority remain resident (Bennett 2012). Some adolescents from one to five years of age and 65 cm, will extend their range into deeper water to &lt;25 m depth (Bennett 1993). Based on a study using acoustic telemetry, the mean home range for early juveniles in the Great Fish Estuary, Eastern Cape was small relative to the size of the estuary&#160;(Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011) with similar results from the&#160;East Kleinmonde Estuary, Eastern Cape (Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and from the Kariega Estuary&#160;(R. Bennett and P. Cowley unpublished data).&#160;The adult diet of this species primarily consists of polychaetes, crustaceans, molluscs, mysids, and echinoderms (Bennett 1993). Estuarine juveniles feed on annelids, algae (Mehl 1973), copepods, ostracods (Wooldridge and Bailey 1982), and brachyura (Whitfield 1985) while surf zone juveniles feed on amphipods, mysids, macrurans, polychaets and bivalves (Bennett 1993).&#160;<em><br/></em><em><br/></em><em>	Lithognathus lithognathus</em>&#160;can live from 25 to 30 years of age (Bennett 1993) and has a maximum length and weight of 137.6 cm and 26.3 kg, respectively (Bennett 1993, South African Shore Anglers Association 2012).&#160;Juveniles &lt;5 cm recruit into estuaries along the Eastern and Southern Cape coasts from September to November (Bennett 1993). These recruitment periods are short and depend greatly on periods of high rainfall to open the estuaries which would otherwise not be accessible otherwise (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). <em>Lithognathus lithgnathus</em>&#160;is not able to recruit during overwash events in the East Klienmonde Estuary, during periods of extended drought when the mouth of the estuary was closed, no recruitment of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;was observed (James <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><br/><br/><em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em>&#160;is a rudimentary hermaphrodite, functional gonochorist (Mehl 1973, Bennett 1993). The length at 50% maturity for both sexes is 65 cm and the age at 50% maturity is about six years TL (Bennett, 1993). This species has a single spawning period (Beckley 1984, Bennett 1989, Whitfield and Kok 1992) which occurs in late winter from July to August (Bennett 1993). On the eastern part of the Eastern Cape off the Transkei coast, spawning takes place inshore near the mouths of estuaries over fluvial mud deposits (Bennett 1993). Spawning may be restricted to inshore areas off a few estuaries along the Transkei coast (Mbashe, Mtata, Mzimvubu and Great Kei) (van Niekerk and Turpie 2011).&#160;There is evidence that some adult&#160;<em>L.&#160;</em><em>lithognathus</em>&#160;undergo&#160;an annual, spawning migration along the shore that commences in autumn&#160;(Bennett 1993; S. Lamberth, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pers. comm.; Bennett 2012). Catch data indicate that adults aggregate in False Bay, Western Cape and move northwards and eastwards to the northern parts of the Eastern Cape coast in time for late winter spawning, aggregating again near the Mbashe Estuary by late winter (Bennett 1993).&#160;Eggs and larvae drift southwards after being spawned close inshore along the Eastern Cape coast (especially from the Mbashe River mouth area). After metamorphosis they enter estuaries along the Southeastern Cape, Southern Cape, and Southwestern Cape coasts (Bennett 1993). Post flexion larvae enter estuaries from 1.8 cm to 5.0 cm TL (Beckley 1984, Bennett 1989, Whitfield and Kok 1992).&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>L. lithognathus</em> is estimated to be 13 years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>","<em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em> is threatened by over-fishing, climate change and habitat loss and degradation (Bennett 1993, Whitfield 1997, Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Adults undertake a predictable annual spawning migration, aggregating at certain points where they are targeted heavily by recreational shore anglers. The very narrow spawning habitats of <em>L. lithognathus&#160;</em>are only provided by the fluvial fans off the Mbashe and five, at most, other estuaries on the South African coastline. Considering that this species aggregates to spawn in a small area, illegal harvesting in this area (particularly over the spawning season) is a major threat. The Dwesa-Cwebe MPA encompasses the area believed to represent the species’ main spawning grounds, and there is anecdotal evidence of considerable illegal harvesting of this species (mainly large breeding adults) in this MPA, particularly in the spawning season by both recreational and subsistence anglers&#160;(R. Bennett pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<em>Lithognathus lithognathus </em>possesses life history characteristics that make this species vulnerable to extrinsic impacts during all three life phases. As juveniles, this species inhabits estuaries, especially the lower reaches of estuaries, which provide critical nursery habitats where they will reside for a year or more&#160;(Bennett<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011, R. Bennett and P. Cowley unpublished data). The total area of South African estuaries is approximately 600 km<sup>2</sup>.&#160;Sub-adults and adults reside in the surf zone and in shallow inshore waters where they exhibit high site fidelity while adults undertake an annual spawning migration and form predictable spawning aggregations. Habitat degradation due to infrastructural development, boating activities, freshwater abstraction and overfishing are majors threats to the shallow water and estuarine habitats and have profound impacts on recruitment, as well as population size and structure of species (Whitefield and Cowley 2010). In addition, the site fidelity and small home ranges exhibited by this species (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011)&#160;makes <em>L. lithognathus</em> vulnerable to fragmentation which may exacerbate the issue.&#160;<br/>	<br/><em>	Lithognathus lithognathus </em>has a short recruitment period as it depends greatly on periods of high rainfall which result in the opening/closing of estuaries on the Southern Cape and can result in highly variable estuarine recruitment. The recruitment to estuaries represents a potential bottleneck to the successful maintenance of the population. <em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em> is not able to recruit into estuaries during overwash events nor during extended periods of drought, which has serious implications in terms of climate change. As the effects of climate change are likely to worsen, prolonged periods of drought and shifts in rainfall seasonality may pose serious threats to the recruitment of this species in the future&#160;(Bennett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Additionally, water temperature changes may impose constraints on the timing of spawning, with consequent impacts on successful recruitment (Sheaves 2006). Despite a commercial fishing ban prohibiting the sale of this species and recreational fishing regulations, illegal fishing practices still pose a threat to <em>L. lithognathus</em>. Illegal gill-netting occurs along the south coast and other areas (Hutchings and Lamberth 2002). Stricter recreational regulations were imposed in 2005 but compliance with these regulations is poor. A few examples include Keurbooms Estuary (King <em>et al.</em>&#160;unpublished manuscript) and Sundays Estuary (Cowley <em>et al</em>. 2009) where 100% of <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;taken are smaller than the legal size limit. The lack of regulation compliance and increasing annual participation in the recreational shore fishery pose an increasing threat to <em>L. lithognathus </em>(Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).","The current status of the stock is &lt;25% of its pristine biomass and is considered to be collapsed with spawner biomass per recruit of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;estimated at 6% of the pristine state (Bennett 1993, Lamberth and Joubert 1999). Stocks &lt;25% of the pristine status are indicative of stock depletion in long lived species and yield a high risk of collapse (Clark 1991, Mace and Sissenwine 1993, Thompson 1993, Mace 1994). Reductions in CPUE of &gt;90% coincide with spawner biomass ratios of &lt;10% and are indicative of severe stock depletion (Griffiths 2000). There is an urgent need for reassessment as considerable changes have taken place regarding the exploitation and protection of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus&#160;</em>and&#160;it is possible that the population of this species has declined further<em>&#160;</em>(Bennett and Lamberth 2012, Bennett <em>et al. </em>2011).&#160;<br/><br/><em>	Lithognathus lithognathus&#160;</em>exists in a single, well-mixed population (Bennett 2012) with the main portion of the stock located inshore and in estuaries along the east and west coasts (Brouwer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Lamberth and Mann 2000, Brouwer and Buxton 2002). The distributional range of this species does not have any major geographical barriers to impede gene flow resulting in a well-mixed population with no subpopulation structure (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;The core range of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;may have contracted as this species did not feature in shore-angler catches along the west coast of South Africa and no individuals of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;were collected in gillnet catches from Cape Point to the Olifants River Mouth from 1997 to 1999 (Lamberth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Hutchings and Lamberth&#160;1999).&#160;<em>Lithognathus lithognathus </em>was reported the most common angling species in the Swartkops Estuary on the Eastern Cape in the early 1900s but its contribution declined significantly by the 1970s (Marias and Baird 1980) and was absent from gillnet catches in the same estuary in 1992 (Baird <em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).	<br/><br/><em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;is primarily caught by shore anglers in the Western and Eastern Cape (Brouwer<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;1997) with catches from the 1930s to the 1990s being responsible for ~50% of the total annual catch by mass&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;and ~75% by number (Bennett 1993). By the 1980s, shore angling catches were estimated at 28,000 individuals of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;(Bennett 1993) and 39,000 (86 tonnes) by 1996 (Lamberth 1996).&#160;The beach seine fishery contributed to the majority of<span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em><em>L. lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;mortality prior to 1960 (Bennett 1993).&#160;The beach seine fishery was responsible for 25% by number and 50% by mass of the total catch (Lamberth<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;1994). Total annual catch from 1985 to 1990 was approximately 30,000 to 35,000 fish about 70% of which was taken by recreational anglers and 30% by commercial fisherman with the catch divided equally between the two fisheries in terms of mass (Bennett 1993). Annual catches of&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>L. lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;were estimated to be ~20 tonnes on average but peaking at 100 tonnes in some years and catches were initially widespread in the Northern, Western, and Eastern Cape but largely reduced to False Bay in 1982 (Penney 1991). <em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;taken in the purse seine fishery in False Bay before 1980 was responsible for approximately 300 tonnes annually but reached a peak of 1,000 tonnes from 1980 to 1982. Public outcry resulted in a ban on purse seining of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;in 1983&#160;(Bennett 1993). The catch in the purse-seine fishery was almost entirely made up of mature fish and likely to have accelerated the stock collapse that occurred about that time (Bennett 1993, Penney 1991).&#160;Following the ban, the commercial beach-seine fishery averaged 20 tonnes annually while the recreational shore fishery exceeded 80 tonnes of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;catches annually (Bennett 1993).&#160;A commercial ban (no sale allowed) was implemented in 2001 in response to fear of a continued decline in catches; however, the ban was not executed in a timely manner as the&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;stock had already collapsed (Lamberth and Joubert 1999).&#160;This species is caught by normal beach-seine and sinking “Russman” seine along the Western and Southwestern Cape while the legal fishery was confined to False Bay where up to 20 tonnes or 4,700 fish were landed annually (Lamberth<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Lithhgnathus lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;is the sixth most frequently reported by-catch species caught in the Western Cape gill-net fishery but comprises less than 1% of monitored catches by mass and by number (Hutchings and Lamberth 1999).<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">CPUE for the shore angling fishery declined&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">from 2.3 fish/100 angler hours from 1971 to 1984 to 0.9 fish./100 angler hours in the 1990s, 1996. representing a 61% decrease over a ten year period (Bennett 1993, Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994,&#160;Lamberth 1996, Brouwer <em>et al. </em>1997,&#160;Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011<span class=""apple-converted-space"">).&#160;CPUE from both recreational and commercial fisheries has declined considerably over the past 40–50 years (Bennett 1993, Lamberth<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Brouwer<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, Lamberth 2000, Pradervand and Baird 2002).<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;This species contributed ~30% to annual angler catches by mass in the 1960s in the Southwestern Cape shore fishery but declined to 8% in 1990 to 1991, and to 0.6% in 1994 to 1996 (Lamberth 1996). A similar decline in catch composition of shore angler catches and seine net catches in the Western Cape has also been recorded (Bennett 1993, Lamberth 1996). Catch frequencies have declined by almost an order of 2.3magnitude over the last decade. Between 1971 and 1984, 90% of angler outings yielded zero, and 5.2% one fish as opposed to 97% and 2.3% for 1994 to 1996 (Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;1994, Lamberth 1996).&#160;An 85% decline in mean annual reported catches of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;was observed in the beach seine fishery from 23,061 fish/year<span class=""apple-converted-space""> between 1897 and 1906 to 3,147 fish/year<span class=""apple-converted-space""> between 1983 and 1991 (Bennett 1993); however, this decline could be a result of the net catches of “linefish” being outlawed in all areas except False Bay during 1983 to 1991 (Bennett 1993, Lamberth <em>et al.&#160;</em>1994).&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">After the closure to fishing at Koppie Alleen, CPUE increased in the De Hoop MPA from 0.42 fish/100 angler hours between 1984 and 1985 to 2.63 fish/100 angler hours by 1990 (Bennett and Attwood 1991), and to 4.68 fish/100 angler hours at Koppie Alleen and Lekkerwater by 1992 (Bennett and Attwood 1993).&#160;Long-term seine-net monitoring programs conducted in the Berg Estuary indicated increases in CPUE since the commercial closure in 2001 (K.

Catch data for subsistence fisheries in the surf zone are limited (Mann<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;2003); however there is evidence that suggests large catches of undersized individuals by estuarine subsistence and recreational fisheries (P. Cowley, South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity pers. comm., Bennett and Lamberth 2012). Recreational boat catches from estuaries are very low relative to other angling species and individuals that are landed are usually undersized.<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;was historically a major component in recreational and competition catches in some estuaries (Marias and Baird 1980). Boat-based catches are negligible and formed a small component of commercial lineboat catches from 1897 to 1906 in Walker Bay but absent from 1985 to 1996 (Attwood and Farquhar 1999). This species was a small component in commercial lineboat bycatch in False Bay until the 1990s (Lamberth and Bennett 1993).&#160;Total bycatch is estimated at under one tonne annually for recreational and commercial lineboats (Lamberth and Mann 2000). Bycatch recorded for monitored gillnet catches along the Western Cape was negligible in the 1990s (Hutchings and Lamberth 2002); however, under-reporting in the fishery is high, leaving the contribution of this fishery to total catch higher than it is reported to be (Lamberth<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;1997).&#160;<em>Lithognathus lithognathus</em>&#160;has been successfully cultured in the marine aquaculture industry but is still in the preliminary stages. A number of biological, social, and economic concerns are to be addressed before full production commences (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).</span></span></span></span></span></p>Cowley and Whitfield (2001) quantified population size estimates in the East Kleinemonde Estuary, Eastern Cape over a three year period. Population estimates for <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;ranged from 300 to 3,500 individuals while an increasing trend in annual recruitment was observed from 2002 to 2006 (Cowley and Whitfield 2001, James&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007).&#160;Occurrence of this species on the west coast between Cape Point and the Orange River is now rare and juvenile populations in the estuaries in this region have declined by 80% to 91% of pristine reference conditions (Lamberth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;The hypothetical, historical west coast spawning population of <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;is functionally extinct due to beach-seine and gillnet fishery over-exploitation (S.J. Lamberth, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry pers. obs.; Bennett and Lamberth 2012).&#160;In recent years,&#160;<em>L. lithognthus</em>&#160;was ranked as the second most common teleost in shore angler catches based on a survey north of Sundays River in Algoa Bay from 2006 to 2009 (Chalmers 2011) and is now ranked as the first most common teleost in research angling (P.D.

The core distribution of this species ranges just from north of Cape Columbine in the west to the Mbashe Estuary in the east (Lamberth&#160;and Mann&#160;2000). The estuaries inhabited by&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;juveniles range from the Berg Estuary on the Western Cape to Mbhanyana on the Eastern Cape coast which comprises <em>c.&#160;</em>146 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of estuary surface area (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Bennett and Lamberth 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>There is some evidence of the presence of <em>L. lithognathus </em>off the Namibian coast but this has yet to be confirmed (Bianchi <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Bennet and Lamberth 2012). A juvenile recorded from the Cunene River Estuary also needs to be confirmed (Bennett and Lamberth 2012).&#160;Although occasionally found as far north as Durban in KwaZulu-Natal (van der Elst 1988), occurrence is rare north of Coffee Bay along the Wild Coast (Mann <em>et al.</em> 2003).","<em>Lithognathus lithognathus </em>is targeted by recreational fishers and is primarily caught by shore anglers in the Western and Eastern Cape (Brouwer et al. 1997). This species is also taken by beach seine and was previously taken by purse seine and was targeted commercially until both were banned (Lamberth and Jourbert 1999, Bennett 1993). This species is not a significant component of the spearfish fishery (Mann<em> et al. </em>1997) and are considered negligible when compared to the recreational shore and commercial beach seine fisheries (Bennett and Lamberth 2012). This species has been successfully reared in captivity but it is likely to be too slow growing to result in commercial production (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Marine,"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered to play a major role in the conservation of <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;(Bennett and Lamberth 2012). The De Hoop MPA had an increase in CPUE after its closure and currently has the second highest CPUE recorded for this species anywhere along the coastline (Bennett and Attwood 1991, 1993; Bennett 2012).&#160;The De Hoop, Tsitsikamma, and Sardinia Bay no-take MPAs afford some refuge to one to five year old &lt;65 cm <em>L. lithognathus</em> individuals which exhibit a fair degree of residency (Bennett and Attwood 1991, 1993). In addition, the Dwesa-Cwebe no-take MPA affords protection to adult spawning aggregations of this species (Bennett 1993; S. Lamberth, MCM pers. comm.).&#160;In 2001, a commercial ban was established for <em>L. lithgnathus </em>prohibiting the sale of this species&#160;and the by catch of this species (Hutchings and Lamberth 2002). For recreational and subsistence fishers <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;has a minimum size limit of 60 cm TL and a daily bag limit of one fish per person per day. This also applies to seine and gill net fishermen in False Bay and along the West Cape coast where no <em>L. lithognathus</em> may be kept or sold. Subsistence anglers are permitted to sell their catch of <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;locally (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>	Compliance with fishing regulations for this species is poor as illegal gill-netting occurs along the south and west coast (Lamberth <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997). Also&#160;a large proportion of <em>L. lithognathus</em>&#160;taken by recreational and subsistence shore and estuarine fishers are smaller than the legal size limit (Cowley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Bennett <em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011). The legal bag limit for this species does not play a major role in the protection of this species as two or more legal-sized <em>L. lithognathus </em>individuals<em>&#160;</em>are caught in less than 2% of shore angler outings (Brouwer <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997).&#160;The implementation and enforcement of fishing regulations for <em>L. lithognathus </em>requires revision (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;Continual efforts are made to lift the ban on commercial fishing of&#160;<em>L. lithognathus</em> (i.e. to allow sale)&#160;which would almost certainly result in the total collapse of the stock. The economic value of the recreational fishery needs to be determined and recognized in local fisheries management procedures (Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;<br/><br/>	A variety of additional conservation efforts have been proposed including more marine/estuarine protected areas, a closed fishing season (Bennett 1993, 2012), the closure of Amathole and Goukamma MPAs to shore angling (Bennett 2012), improvement in law enforcement and compliance, and reduction in illegal fishing in spawning grounds (Bennett and Lamberth 2012, Venter and Mann 2012). A network of estuarine protected areas and the establishment of no-take areas in the sandy lower reaches of estuaries is recommended to aid the protection of juvenile <em>L. lithognthus </em>(Bennett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). A closed fishing season from July to September during which time adults aggregate to spawn would aid in the protection of this species (Bennett 1993).","",,false,false,Global

As in other guitarfishes, reproduction is aplacental viviparous and females give birth to live young (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Female age-at-maturity is about 8.5 years and longevity is 11 years (Caltabellota <em>et al.</em> 2019, F. Caltabellota pers. comm. 2019), and therefore generation length is estimated at 9.75 years.","The Chola Guitarfish is targeted and/or caught as bycatch in commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its range. Gears include demersal trawls, beach seines, gillnets, and trammel nets. These fisheries are unmanaged thoughout its range, and in some areas are intense. For example, in Colombia, this species is among the most commonly caught in both artisanal and commercial fisheries (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2007, Grijalba-Bendeck <em>et al.</em> 2007). In northern Brazil, several elasmobranchs have been reduced alarmingly by overfishing (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). Some parts of its range are likely to be suffering from habitat degradation due to coastal development and pollution (Gonçalves-Silva and Vianna 2018).","There are no range-wide estimates of population size or trend. The level of intense and unmanaged fishing pressure on the Caribbean coast of Central and South America leads to suspicion of steep population reduction. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas.&#160;In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia unpubl. data 2018) at the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery.&#160;In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza, 2015).&#160;Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al.</em> 2001). Despite some area closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there as a result of dwindling catches (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016, Santana <em>et al. </em>2020). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;In Brazil, there are no data for this species, however, the closely-related Brazilian Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos horkelii) </em>has suffered severe population depletion (&gt;80% between 1986–2001) from overfishing there, and it is suspected that this species has fared similarly. Overall, due to the level of unmanaged and intense fishing pressure across its range, the near-disappearance of other elasmobranchs including similar species, and coastal habitat degradation, it is suspected that the Chola Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (about 30 years), and these pressures show no sign of abating in the near future.",Decreasing,"The Chola Guitarfish occurs patchily in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from Quintana Roo, Mexico to <span class=""st"">Paraná, Brazil (Schmitter-Soto <em>et al</em>. 2000, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).

These sharks are known to use coastal waters off Caiçara do Norte, Brazil, as a nursery (Yokota and Lessa 2006). Reproduction is yolk-sac placental viviparity with litter sizes of 1–6 pups, a gestation period of 10–11 months and size-at-birth of 31–50 cm TL (Carlson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Driggers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004,&#160;Sulikowski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).

Regional variation in age parameters is evident. In the United States, age-at-maturity is estimated at 4.5 years and maximum age at 12.5 years; generation length is therefore 8.5 years (Driggers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). In northeast Brazil, age-at-maturity is estimated at 6 years and maximum age at  15 years; generation length is therefore 10.5 years (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Blacknose Shark is captured as a retained bycatch in longlines, gillnets, trawls, and recreationally on hook and line. In the United States in 2009, estimated commercial landings were 29,230 individuals while recreational catches were 1,070 individuals (SEDAR 2011a,b). The numbers caught as bycatch in commercial shrimp trawl were estimated at 1,025 individuals. In the state of Campeche, Mexico, Blacknose Shark is targeted in gillnet and longline fisheries.&#160;<br/><br/>Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of Southwest Atlantic, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas.

The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20 to 1000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011).","In the United States (US), no genetic difference was found in the population structure between the US south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2010). Population trend data are available from broad-scale trends in relative abundance for the southeast US (Peterson <em>et al. </em>2017), a fishery independent survey (A. Pollack&#160;SEFSC Mississippi Laboratories pers. comm. 28/02/2018), and two stock assessments for the US south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 2011a,b). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020, Winker <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the attached Supplementary Information).&#160;<br/><br/>First, in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the relative abundance time-series from trawl gear (1995–2018)&#160;indicated that the population initially increased, peaked and declined before an upturn at the end of the time-series resulting in an overall annual rate of increase of 4.8%. The northern Gulf of Mexico and southeast USA trawl survey using multiple gear (1989–2014) exhibited a steady annual rate of decline of 6.1%. Stock assessments from the US South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico had annual rates of declines of 1.8% and 2.1% to 2009 (SEDAR 2011a,b). However, an increasing trend of 4.8% per year was found from a fishery independent bottom longline survey covering the same geographic area from 1995 to 2018 (SEDAR 2011a,b). Taken together, the Blacknose Shark is estimated to have declined 2.8% per year over 3 generation lengths (26 years). The corresponding probabilities for population reduction fall between 57% probability of 50–79% and 43% probability of 30–49%. Blacknose Shark is not common in fisheries in Central America, Cuba or eastern Caribbean. Seasonal aggregations (100s of animals) do occur in the Bahamas, but they are protected due to the Shark Sanctuary. The species is not a significant portion of the fin trade (&lt;0.5%; Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018) and is harvested primarily for meat elsewhere. Blacknose Shark is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) in the Western Central Atlantic as the population has appeared to have stabilized since the 1990s, and population projections from the stock assessment in the Gulf of Mexico indicate rebuilding is possible (Siegfried and Brooks 2007), and species-specific management exists in the US and Mexico (see Conservation Section).&#160;<br/><br/>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic there are no population trend estimates for this species. In Colombia, this species is rare and is only known from a few confirmed specimens and is listed as Data Deficient nationally (Gómez <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Venezuela, artisanal fisheries are intense and do catch this species, and trawl pressure was intense until the national ban in 2006. It is suspected that these unmanaged fisheries have caused a reduction in population size. In the Guianas and northwestern Brazil, intense commercial and artisanal fisheries operate with little management, and have led to drastic declines in other elasmobranchs (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016) and it is suspected that reductions have occurred there. For example, this species was known to be much more common in the State of Maranhão a decade ago (G. Rincon pers. comm. 28/02/2018). In the State of Parà, this species was formerly very common, but today there are very few adults being encountered in landings (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2018). Demographic analysis from Pernambuco State indicate a 44% decline over three generation lengths (26 years) due to mortality in the gillnet fishery, and that fishery now lands mostly juveniles. In Cearà State, landings of this species declined by 64% between 1998–1999, and by 2015–2016 had declined by 78% since 1998–1999 (V. Faria pers. comm. 21/05/2018). This shark has been caught in intensifying commercial and artisanal fisheries in southern Brazil since the 1950s, and although there are no data, it is suspected that this species has undergone a similar reduction in population size there as in other parts of its range.&#160;Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, and notable declines in landings in several areas, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) in the Southwest Atlantic part of its range.<br/>&#160;<br/>Overall, given that the Southwest Atlantic portion of the range comprises at least two-thirds of the geographic range, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years).",Decreasing,"The Blacknose Shark occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from North Carolina to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea&#160;(Castro 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","Blacknose Shark is utilized primarily for meat.

This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Blacknose Shark is managed under this plan. There are also coastal gillnet bans in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Texas which will also provide protection for the species. There is a commercial retention of eight Blacknose Shark on all trips when the Blacknose Shark fishery is open.&#160;To end overfishing and rebuild the Blacknose Shark stock, NMFS established a separate quota of 17.2 metric t dressed weight for Blacknose Shark.&#160;<br/>                   <p>In Central America and Dominic Republic, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the Sistem of Integration of Central America, prohibit Shark Finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries (from Belize to Panama), including the Dominican Republic.

The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that prohibit finning and the protect some species (whale shark, white shark, basking shark, sawfishes, and species of <em>Mobula</em>). It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a marine protected area of 30 km from the Rio Bravo´s mouth to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Marine Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.  </p><p>In the Guatemalan Caribbean, there are fishing ban for one month (usually August) for the capture of sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge. There are some marine protected areas in the middle and west of Panama, which can benefit shark populations because it establishes management in these areas like fishery controlled areas. However, enforcement is a challenge. In 2006, a regulation was approved that prohibited shark finning in Panama waters. In 2017, another regulation was implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of number of hooks up to 1,000 per surface longline strand).  </p><p>There is a national regulation (Governmental Degree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Degree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems. Longline fishing was banned in The Bahamas in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year (UN FAO). The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004 (UN FAO). The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas <em>et al</em>. 2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts in The Bahamas. This protection does not extend to rays or skates. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploitation may be occurring at present or in the future.</p><p>Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad, and Tobago developed draft National Plans of Action–Sharks in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad, and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species.&#160;</p><p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>  <p></p><p><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global
896599,126710128,Mobula hypostoma,Endangered,A2cd+3d,2019,2018-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Atlantic Devilray (<em>Mobula hypostoma</em>) is a medium-sized (to 120 cm disc width)&#160;coastal pelagic ray endemic to the Atlantic Ocean to depths of 100 m. Like most species of <em>Mobula</em>, the Atlantic Devilray has a very low reproductive output, with a late estimated age-at-maturity and low fecundity, and presumably a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored mobulid fisheries worldwide. Due mainly to its schooling behavior and its coastal near-shore distribution, this species is likely a bycatch component of many small-scale fisheries; this fishing effort has largely been unreported with catches often generalized as <em>Mobula</em> species. This species is widespread throughout the tropics and temperate waters of the Atlantic and depletions of the Atlantic Devilray are suspected in some parts of its range based on reduced sightings, and declines in catches and landings in recent years. It is now absent from many areas believed to be a part of its former geographic range and there have been few sightings in many countries, particularly in Brazil. Trends from  genus-wide data where devilrays face heavy fishing pressure outside the range of the Atlantic Devilray, indicate significant declines of 51 to 94%  over 10- to 15-year periods (~one generation length). The levels of fishing pressure resulting in these declines are similar to that likely in West Africa. Based on current and future levels of exploitation, declining trends, and a reduction in area of occupancy, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generations (38 years), with a further population reduction  suspected over the next three  generation lengths (2019–2057) due to  ongoing demand for high-value  products. The Atlantic Devilray is therefore assessed as Endangered A2cd+3d.</p><p><br/></p>","The Atlantic Devilray is a schooling pelagic species of coastal and oceanic waters from the surface down to depths of 100 m (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 1986, McEachran and Carvalho 2002, Wiegmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 120 cm disc width (DW), with reports of up to 230 cm DW in Venezuela (Ehemann <em>et al. </em>2017); males mature at 114 cm DW; and, females mature at 111 cm DW (McEachran and Carvalho 2002). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with a single pup with size-at-birth of 55–97 cm DW (McEachran and Carvalho 2002, Ehemann <em>et al.</em> 2017). Similar to other mobulid species, the Atlantic Devilray may have resting periods of 1–3 years in the wild between pregnancies (Marshall and Bennett 2010, Deakos 2011, Stevens 2016). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown; they are inferred from the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, note that the Giant Devilray reaches a considerably larger size than the Atlantic Devilray (520 vs 120 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.","<p> </p><p>Mobulids, including the Atlantic Devilray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016, Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2018). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). <br/></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB"">Global landings of mobulids, including the Atlantic Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, total landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack  and Sant 2009). While this equates to an average of 1,593 tonnes being  landed per annum, reported landings are likely to represent only a  fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em>  2013).&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The source locations for the largest amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</p>Despite often being unintentionally caught, mobulids are typically retained because of their high trade value. Even when discarded alive, for example from tuna purse seine fisheries, they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017). Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and dozens of national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<p>Significant landings of mobulids have occurred in Caribbean fisheries over the last 20 years, with 21,000 <em>Mobula</em>  spp. landed in the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico alone (J. Carlson unpubl. data). In the Atlantic Ocean, devilrays are taken as bycatch in the Southwest   Atlantic Uruguayan and Japanese Longline Fisheries, which operate within   the Uruguayan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and adjacent international   waters (Mas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015). Information from 2008 reported that  the Atlantic Devilray  was only occasionally captured in the Uruguay  longline  fisheries; data from  Uruguay's national observer program  indicated  that an average of 4.4  individuals per year were recorded  during a  10-year period, 80% of  which were released (A. Domingo pers.  obs.  2008). However, the post-release  mortality of released  individuals is likely to be high, based on the high post-release  mortality for the cogener Bentfin Devilray (<em>Mobula thurstoni</em>) on longlines (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><em></em></p><p><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB"">Off the West African coast in the Atlantic Ocean, <em>Mobula</em> species are caught in the tuna purse seine fisheries, likely including the Atlantic Devilray, with an estimated 70 metric tonne of rays, predominantly <em>Mobula</em> spp, caught annually between 2003 and 2007 (Amandè <em>et al.</em> 2010).<span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""> There   are artisanal fisheries in multiple West African countries that target   devilrays for human consumption both locally and for export to other   markets (Doumbouya 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Ender and   Fernando 2014).

Globally, however, genus-wide declines are suspected based on declining sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) data from monitored populations, catch landings data, and evidence of depletion (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hall and Roman 2013, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Rohner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Furthermore<a>, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</a>Population trend data for devilrays are most often not species-specific. Hence, many of rates of decline are inferred or suspected, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits.</p><p>Little information is currently available on abundance and population trends of the Atlantic Devilray and further information is required from throughout its range.&#160;It is exposed to many of the same threats as other&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;species and is constrained by the same low reproductive rate and hence very low population growth rate, suggesting this species is facing similar pressure to other&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;species. It is suspected, based on distribution data, high catchability due to its schooling behavior, and a lack of refuge from coastal fishing pressure that the Atlantic Devilray may have been depleted or declined in areas where significant fisheries or threats for mobulids exist.&#160;</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p>  The Atlantic Devilray is now absent from many areas believed to be a part of their former geographic range and there have been few sightings in some countries, particularly in Brazil (O. Gadig pers. comm. 7/11/2018). In Uruguay, catch rates of <em>Mobula</em> spp. (including Atlantic Devilray) in the longline fisheries are low, and have also declined steeply in recent years. Mas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2015)  estimated that only 201 devilrays were  incidentally caught during  1998–2013, equaling a catch-per-unit-effort  (CPUE) of 0.028 individuals  per 1,000 hooks, which represents only 0.05%  of the total longline  catch. Catches of devilrays, that included Atlantic Devilray, fluctuated  markedly from 1998 to 2013, with the greatest numbers of individuals (40–50 per year) taken in 2009–2011 followed by a significant drop to &lt;5 individuals per year in 2013 (Mas&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). This represents a very steep decline of 90% decline over a 4-year period and infers a steep population reduction.<p>In the Atlantic Ocean waters off the  Republic of Guinea, landings of&#160;<em>Mobula&#160;</em>species, that include the  Atlantic Devilray, are declining and a decrease in maximum observed  sizes was observed from 2001–2010 (Doumbouya 2011).

Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In all cases presented below, the overall fishing effort has increased (although directed fishing effort may have shifted in response to resource collapse/depletion).<br/></p><p>These datasets from the Indo-West Pacific show: (1) a 51% decline in <em>Mobula</em> spp. in landings over a 10-year period from 1993–95 to 2002–2004 in India from Kerala, Chennai and Tuticorin coasts, and Mumbai (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009, Nair<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013, Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015); (2) off Sri Lanka, population reductions are strongly suspected because fishers reported declines in devilray catches over the last decade and a half with a steady increase in fishing pressure (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;et al.&#160;2011); and, (3) In Indonesia, 63–94% declines in <em>Mobula</em> spp catches over a 15-year period from 2001–2014 in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java) (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>    Overall, the limited data show inferred population reduction in the Southwest Atlantic and although less information is available in other regions, it is suspected, based on known threats, that the species would be in decline, with the only exception being the slightly increasing trend on the east coast of the United States. Trends from genus-wide data in areas of known heavy fishing pressure, similar to that likely in West Africa, indicate significant declines of 51 to 94% over 10- to 15- year periods (~one generation length). Based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep  declining trends, and the lack of data  in some regions, particularly those with high fishing pressure, together with a reduction in area of occupancy due to suspected local extinctions, it is suspected that the Atlantic Devilray global  population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three  generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction  suspected over the next three generation lengths (2019–2057) due to  ongoing demand for high-value products.<br/><p></p><p>  </p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Devilray is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean where it is patchily distributed.

This species is an apex predator that occurs on sub-tidal reefs throughout its distributional range. Although evidence suggests that&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;is highly fecund, this species does not attain sexual maturity until approximately seven years of age. Adults are believed to undertake an eastward migration to the Eastern Cape coast and southern KwaZulu-Natal where they aggregate to spawn and are actively targeted. Juveniles inhabit sub-tidal reefs and exhibit strong site fidelity which may make them susceptible to localized overfishing. <em>Petrus rupestris</em> has experienced a substantial range contraction due to the severe depletion of the stock as well as decreases in abundance in areas where this species&#160;was once common.&#160;The overexploited status of <em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;has been recognized for at least the past 30 years and although strict regulations were gradually implemented, stock recovery was not apparent, ultimately leading to the collapse of the stock and the implementation of a moratorium in 2012. There is a need for more precise information regarding the spatial and temporal occurrence of spawning aggregations and the distribution of eggs and larvae of <em>P. rupestris</em>. <em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;experienced a decline in CPUE of 84% from the 1930s to the early 1990s in the southern Cape as well as a dramatic decline of &gt;75% from 1986 to 1998 on the Agulhas Bank.&#160;The total reported commercial catch for this species has declined from about 75 tonnes (1985–1992) to an average of less than 4.3 tonnes (2001-2007) indicative of a ~95% decrease. In addition, from 1985 to 2007 CPUE declined from 1.1 kg/man/hr to 0.5 kg/man/hr.&#160;While this later decline may be partly due to the strict regulations introduced to protect this species, much of the decline took place during the latter half of the 20th century and there has been no indication of any stock recovery after the regulations were implemented. In addition, standardized abundance indices provide further evidence for a consistent population decline of 95% in the Western Cape and 65% in the Eastern Cape. This evidence represents an overall population decline of at least 75% within three generation lengths (51 years), and the species is thus listed as Endangered under A2bd. These documented population reductions, however, are almost reaching the thresholds of listing under Critically Endangered, and a thorough evaluation of the stock is urgently needed to determine the current standing of the populations and the effectiveness of the moratorium currently in place.","<p>Adults of this species are found on offshore rocky reefs from 50 m to 160 m (Smale 1988, Mann and Kerwath 2013) while juveniles are found on shallower reefs between five and 50 m (Smale 1988). Juveniles appear to be resident in the southwest and southeast Cape with adults migrating eastwards to the Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal (Smale 1988, Griffiths and Wilke 2002). <em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;feeds primarily on reef fish, crustaceans, squid and octopus  and is an important apex predator on deep rocky reefs (Smale 1986). Small juveniles feed primarily on mysids, carids and gobies and gradually begin to feed on reef fish as they grow larger (Smith 1986). Juveniles &lt;70 cm FL reside on shallower inshore reefs between Cape Point and Kei Mouth in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape (Mann and Kerwath 2013). Once they reach maturity, adults migrate eastwards to the former Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal (Smale 1988, Wilke and Griffiths 1999, Brouwer 2002, Griffiths and Wilke 2002). This species is the largest of the Sparidae attaining a maximum weight of 70 kg (Smith and Heemstra 1991, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004) with a South African angling record of 56.6 kg from 1994 (South African Deep Sea Anglers Association 2012). <em>Petrus rupestris </em>is capable of reaching ages in excess of 33 years (Smale and Punt 1991). The maximum recorded length for <em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;is 200 cm TL (van der Elst 1993, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).</p>  <p><strong>Reproduction</strong></p><p>This species is a late gonochorist (<em>sensu </em>rudimentary hermaphrodite) (Smale 1988) and attains sexual maturity at 7.2 years at a size 63 cm TL for both sexes (Smale and Punt 1991, Smale 1988). Spawning occurs between August and October and appears to be restricted to the area between East London and southern KwaZulu-Natal (Smale 1988, Garratt 1988) and on the offshore Agulhas Banks (Penney and Wlke 1993, Griffiths 2000). The distribution of eggs and larvae for this species has yet to be documented (van der Elst 1993) with no records from Tsitskamma (Wood 1998) or the KwaZulu-Natal coast (Connell 2012). This species exhibits group-synchronous maturation and adults aggregate to spawn (de Vlaming 1983, Smale 1988). The ovaries of large&#160;<em>P. rupestris </em>individuals can weigh up to 1.8 kg which suggests that this species is highly fecund (Smale 1988). Sequential catch seasons along the Cape and Transkei coast indicate&#160;that&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;under takes an annual eastward spawning migration (Penney and Wilke 1993, Brouwer 2002) but there is no indication of a return migration. This species may also move between the inshore and offshore Agulhas Banks to spawn but additional tagging data is needed to confirm this (Penney and Wilke 1993, Wilke and Griffiths 1999, Griffiths and Wilke 2002).&#160;</p><p>Generation length for <em>P. rupestris</em> is estimated to be 17 years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>&#160;</p><em></em>","<em>Petrus rupestris</em> is a long lived and slowing growing species that migrates&#160;northwards to the Eastern Cape where they aggregate to spawn and were historically targeted by recreational and commercial line fishermen (Mann and Kerwath 2013).&#160;This species exhibits life history attributes that make it extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and make the recovery of the stock more challenging. <em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;can live to at least 33 years and does not reach sexual maturity until 7.2 years of age and a size of 63 cm (Smale and Punt 1991, Smale 1988). Although there is currently a moratorium in place for this species illegal fishing, especially&#160;on spawning aggregations, poses a serious threat to <em>P. rupestris </em>and may impede stock recovery<em>.</em><em><br/></em><em><br/></em><em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;has been subject to a range contraction attributed to a decrease in population size (van der Elst and Garratt 1984, van der Elst&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992, Penney and Wilke 1993, Penney&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Griffiths 2000). Stocks &lt;25% of the pristine status are indicative of stock depletion in long lived species and yield a high risk of collapse (Clark 1991, Mace and Sissenwine 1993, Thompson 1993, Mace 1994). Reductions in CPUE of &gt;90% coincide with spawner biomass ratios of &lt;10% and are indicative of severe stock depletion (Griffiths 2000).&#160;The <em>P. rupestris&#160;</em>stock is currently believed to have collapsed with &lt; 5% spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) and a CPUE decrease by more than 90% (Mann and Kerwath 2013).","<p>The&#160;<em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;fishery has been closed since the implementation of a moratorium in 2012 (Department of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries 2012).&#160;<em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;was historically an important recreational and commercial species in skiboat catches throughout its range (Penney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Griffiths 2000). In more recent years, this species formed a relatively small component of recreational and commercial skiboat catches in most areas except the Eastern Cape where it still comprised an important component if the catch (Smale and Buxton 1985, Hecht&#160;and Tilney 1989,&#160;Hecht&#160;and Buxton 1993, Penney and Wilke 1993, Fielding&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Brouwer and Buxton 2002, Griffiths and Lamberth 2002, Fennessy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Donovan 2010). Historically,&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;was taken by shore anglers in False Bay (Schoeman and Schoeman 1990) and taken on occasion by spearfishermen (van der Elst 1993).&#160;<em>Petrus ruepstris</em>&#160;has been reported in incidental catches from the inshore trawl fishery and shark longline fleet (DAFF unpublished data).&#160;Freezer vessels introduced in the early 1980s were equipped with high-precision navigational equipment and long-range capability and were able to effectively exploit previously unexploited &#160;populations of <em>P. rupestris</em> further offshore on the Agulhas Banks. This species rapidly became a highly prized fish and resulted in increased competition between vessels (S. Knobel and K. Kingma captains of freezer boats pers. comm.). Catch rates subsequently declined rapidly from about 15 kg per fisher per day in 1986 to around 2 kg per fisher per day since 1990&#160;(Griffiths 2000).</p>CPUE declined by more than 90% throughout the 20th&#160;century (Griffiths 2000, Griffiths and Wilke 2002).&#160;A slight increase in CPUE was observed in the former Transkei between 1984 and 1992 (Hecht&#160;and Buxton 1993) but is thought that this was due to improved targeting on spawning aggregations on deep reefs (B. Mann, Oceanographic Research Institute pers. obs.). A similar increase in CPUE was recorded on the offshore Agulhas Banks during the 1980s and was due to improved targeting by larger freezer vessels but did not last long (Penney and Wilke 1993, Griffiths 2000, Griffiths and Wilke 2002). Nominal commercial skiboat CPUE data stored on the National Marine Linefish System showed a further 90% decline between 1985 and 2007 from 0.045 kg per man per hour to 0.005 kg per man per hour and commercial ski boat catches&#160;declined from 96 tonnes in 1991 to 1.9 tonnes in 2005 (National Marine Linefish System&#160;unpublished data). An additional analysis was conducted to corroborate these trends. Generalized Additive Models were fitted to standardize the probability of capturing <em>P. rupestris</em> along the South African coast by removing the effects of targeting and spatial and temporal variations (Winker and Attwood 2014). The modeling framework was based on approach described in Winker <em>et al</em>. (2013). The probability of capture is widely used for rare species and is considered to be more defensible than catch rates in weight because of it being less sensitive to management regulations such as catch restrictions by bag limits. The trends for the period 1985-2011 show that the capture probability of <em>P.rupestris</em> declined from 16% in 1985-86 to less than 1% 2010-2011 between Cape Point and Tsitsikamma and from 23% to less than 8% along the Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal coast, corresponding to declines of more than 95% and 64% respectively. Percentage catch composition declined significantly in KwaZulu-Natal &#160;and Cape waters throughout the 20th century (Penney&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Griffiths 2000). Catch composition of&#160;<em>P. rupestris </em>in the&#160;Port Alfred skiboat fishery indicated that this species declined from 44% to 3.3% to 9.9% for commercial catches and 15.3% to 4.6% to 5.1% for recreational fisheries for the periods 1985 to 1987, 1996 to 1998, and 2006 to 2008 for the ""Sparid group""&#160;respectively (Hecht and Tilney 1989, Donovan 2010). Before 1970, a decline in the catch rates of adults was observed off northern Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal (van der Elst and Garratt 1984) and in the East London area (Winch 1999). Catch rates of higher trophic level reef fish declined substantially between the two fishery-independent surveys conducted from 1931 to 1933 and 1987 to 1993 off the Southern Cape with the decline in CPUE of&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;at 84%. If the&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;population had not been seeded by partially protected adult stocks on the offshore Agulhas Bank and Transkei, declines would have been much greater. Based on fishery-independent catch composition surveys from 1931 to 1933 conducted off the southern Cape,&#160;<em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;comprised 12% in the first survey and 6% in the second (Griffiths 2000).<br/><p><em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;has undergone a coast-wise and seaward contraction in the range of adult abundance (Griffiths 2000).&#160;The status of the stock is &lt;25% and is considered to be collapsed based on a CPUE decline &gt;90% &#160;throughout the 20th century (Griffiths 2000, Griffiths and Wilke 2002) and it has been suggested that the <em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;stock has been reduced to &lt;5% of the pristine level (Griffiths and Lamberth 2002). This species has also undergone a range contraction thought to be associated with a reduction in the population (van der Elst and Garratt 1984, van der Elst <em>&#160;et al. </em>1992, Penney and Wilke 1993, Penney <em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1999, Griffiths 2000). Large individuals of this species were commonly caught from the shore in the Southwestern Cape in the beginning of the 20th century, indicative of a seaward contraction in the adult distributional range (Biden 1930, Horne 1955, Burman 1989). Commercial fishermen along the South African coast have stated that catches of <em>P. rupestris&#160;</em>have declined dramatically in the past three decades (Smale 1988). Catch data from line-boats operating along the east coast and landing their catches in Durban support this overall decline (P.A. Garratt, Oceanographic Research Institute pers. comm.). During the early 1950s,&#160;<em>P. rupestris </em>became less abundant in the False Bay, Plettenberg Bay and Tsitsikamma areas (Schoeman 1957) which suggests that this trend was widely spread (Griffiths 2000). The Agulhas Banks provide spawning grounds for large adults and the demise of these individuals is likely to have had a negative impact on recruitment to the near-shore fishing grounds off the southern Cape and southwestern Cape (Griffiths 2000). Numbers of adult fish are still found in the Eastern Cape where they receive protection both in a number of MPAs and on deep reefs where they are difficult to access due to the strong prevailing Agulhas Current (Hecht&#160;and Buxton 1993).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Petrus rupestris</em> is endemic to South Africa and is known from Table Bay, Southwestern Cape to St Lucia, KwaZulu-Natal (Smith and Heemstra 1991, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).&#160;The stock has been substantially depleted resulting in a range contraction, leaving the core of the remaining adult stock located off the Eastern Cape (B. Mann, Oceanographic Research Institute pers. obs.; Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry unpublished data). This species occurs from depths of five to at least 160 m (Smale 1988, Mann and Kerwath 2013). Adults occur primarily between Cape Agulhas and southern KwaZulu-Natal while juveniles are found from Cape Point to Kei Mouth (Buxton and Smale 1984, 1989; Smale 1988; Griffiths 2000).","The&#160;<em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;fishery has been closed since 2012 (Department of Agriculture, Forest, and Fisheries 2012).&#160;<em>Petrus rupestris</em>&#160;was historically an important component of recreational and commercial skiboat catches throughout its range (Penney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1999, Griffiths 2000). In more recent years due to heavy exploitation, this species formed a relatively small component of recreational and commercial skiboat catches in most areas except the Eastern Cape where it still comprised an important component of the catch (Smale and Buxton 1985, Hecht and Tilney 1989,&#160;Hecht&#160;and Buxton 1993, Penney and Wilke 1993, Fielding&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Brouwer and Buxton 2002, Griffiths and Lamberth 2002, Fennessy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Donovan 2010).",Marine,"The fishery for&#160;<em>Petrus rupestris </em>was closed to both commercial and recreational fishing in November 2012 with the implementation of a moratorium due to the overexploited status of the stock (Department of Forest, Agriculture, and Fisheries 2012; Mann and Kerwath 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Historically,&#160;<em>P. rupestris&#160;</em>was&#160;managed under a suite of regulations including a minimum size limit of 60 cm TL, a bag limit of one fish per person per day for both commercial and recreational linefishers and a three-month closure from the 1<sup>st</sup> of September to the 30<sup>th</sup> November each year (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012). In addition to this, the species is present in several large no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on the South African coast including De Hoop, Goukamma, Tsitsikamma, Sardinia Bay, Bird Island, Amathole, Dwesa-Cwebe and Pondoland. Both the Tsitsikamma National Park (Buxton and Smale 1989) and De Hoop Marine Protected Areas (Smale 1988) have been shown to provide an important refuge for juveniles of this species. As the adults spawn in the area between East London and southern KwaZulu-Natal, the only MPAs which provide protection for adults are Amathole, Dwesa-Cwebe and Pondoland MPAs (B. Mann, ORI personal observation).<br/><br/>The overexploitation of <em>P. rupestris</em>&#160;has been acknowledged for the past 30 years but despite the introduction of stricter regulations, there was no evidence of stock recovery. The result of this was the implementation of a moratorium on catches of <em>P. rupestris&#160;</em>in November 2012 which requires strong enforcement to prevent illegal fishing activities. Additionally, angler awareness is also required to educate fishers on the correct manner in which to release unintentionally caught fish to reduce harm and maximize their chance of survival. It is recommended that the moratorium remains in place for at least 10 years during which time there should be a thorough evaluation of the stock (Mann and Kerwath 2013).","",,false,false,Global
1302981,170256,Chrysoblephus gibbiceps,Endangered,A2bd,2014,2009-12-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps</em>&#160;is a minor component of the commercial linefish catch throughout its distributional range and is also targeted by recreational fishers. In addition to targeted exploitation, intrinsic life history traits such as longevity (48 years), high site fidelity and formation of possible spawning aggregations increase the vulnerability of this species to elevated extinction risk. The longevity of this species suggests that it has slow growth while its site fidelity and possible spawning aggregations make <em>C. gibbiceps </em>an easy and predictable target for fishers. Total catch has declined from ~20 tonnes in 1986 to 2 tonnes from 2001–2006 (90% reduction over a 15 year period). CPUE has also gradually declined from 1985 (0.35 kg/man/hr) to 2007 (0.25 kg/man/hr) a 29% decline over this relatively recent period (22 years) in the linefishery. Furthermore, CPUE in the hook and line fisheries in the Southwest, Southeast, and Southern Cape has declined by &gt;90% from historical levels in the early 1900s. However, commercial fishing effort has declined in the traditional linefishery from approximately 3,000 to 450 vessels (85% reduction) since 2006 due to management interventions. Despite the significant reduction in commercial fishing effort, CPUE continued to decline after reduction in effort. However, no stock assessment has been conducted&#160;to validate its current population status and the efficiency of management measures that are currently in place.&#160;Given the significant population reductions that have occurred over three generation lengths (27 years), we infer population declines of between 50% to 90% over three generations. It is therefore&#160;listed as Endangered under A2bd based on these intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. Additional, improved, and systematic conservation management needs to be put in place for this species. An updated stock assessment for this species is highly recommended.","<em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps</em>&#160;is a reef associated, sedentary species that may occur in large shoals and is&#160;common on reefs below 20 m (Buxton and Smale 1984, van Zyl 2013, Griffiths and Wilke 2002, Smale and Buxton 1989, &#160;Beckley and Buxton 1989, Lechantuer and Griffiths 2002). This species is found to depths of 150 m (van der Elst 1988, 1993). <em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps</em>&#160;is an extremely resident species with adults inhabiting offshore reefs while juveniles occur over shallow hardbottom reefs (Wilke and Griffiths 1999, Buxton and Smale 1984).&#160;Lechantuer and Griffiths (2002) note its seasonal occurrence in False Bay and its increased abundance at water temperatures &gt;13°C and increased depth.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps</em>&#160;is a benthic carnivore that feeds on a wide variety of reef associated invertebrates including crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms (van der Elst 1993, Wilke and van Zyl 2012).&#160;Adults of this species feed primarily on ophiuroids, gastropods, and polycheate worms although their diet also includes sea urchins, octopus, and crabs (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). The diet of juvenile <em>C. gibbiceps</em>&#160;&lt;30 cm consists of soft bodied organisms such as malacostraca and as juveniles increase in size, they feed more on hard prey including gastropods (van Zyl 2013). <br/><br/><strong>Reproduction</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps</em> is a late gonochorist (<em>sensu</em> rudimentary hermaphrodite) and lays small pelagic eggs (Buxton 1985, van Zyl 2013). The spawning season in the Southeast Cape is from October to January and peaks in December on the central Agulhas Bank (C.D. Buxton DIFS unpublished data, Wilke and van Zyl 2012). Ripe individuals have been reported from the Southeast Cape and on the Agulhas Bank (van Zyl 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>The length at 50% maturity for this species is 21.2 cm FL for males and 24.9 cm FL for females while most individuals over 35 cm are mature (Wilke and van Zyl 2012, van der Elst 1993). The age at 50% maturity is 2.2 years for males and 3.9 years for females (van Zyl 2013). The maximum length &#160;recorded for this species was 75 cm TL and the maximum weight was 8.1 kg (Smith and Heemstra 1991, South African Underwater Fishing Federation 2012). The maximum age for this species is 48 years (male) (van Zyl 2013).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps&#160;</em>is a slow-growing, long lived species and commercial catch trends show seasonal increases in Struisbaai from May to July (winter) and October to November (early summer) which suggests that this species aggregates to some degree (National Marine Linefish System unpublished data).<br/><p>Generation length for <em>C. gibbiceps</em> is estimated to be nine years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length =Σxl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>/Σl<sub>x</sub>m<sub>x</sub>&#160;</p>","<em>Chrysoblephus gibbiceps </em>is commercially and recreationally targeted and is reported as overexploited (Griffiths 2000).

Major threats to <em>C. gibbiceps&#160;</em>include localized overexploitation by recreational and commercial linefishers, particularly those close to major metropolitan areas (Griffiths 2000).<p></p>The removal of large sparid fish can change the community structure, reduce both primary and secondary production in a temperate-reef ecosystem (Babcock <em>et al.</em> 1999) and can reduce the links of reef ecosystems with the pelagic food web.

Due to the economic importance of the <em>Takifugu </em>genus, and the   prevalence of taxonomic uncertainty within this group, we recommend   further taxonomic studies utilizing both molecular and morphological   methods.","<em>Takigugu plagiocellatus</em> is a little known, shallow water coastal species which inhabits coral reefs and seagrass areas at depths ranging from very shallow waters to 10 m (Liu Jing pers. comm. 2011).<br/><br/>The genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;speciated and radiated in marine waters around China, Korea, and Japan. The highest species density is found in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, followed by the Sea of Japan and Pacific Coast of Japan, and finally by the South China Sea. Several species have been reported from the Indian Ocean (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><p>Tetraodontids are characterized by a tough skin that is often covered with small spinulous scales, a beak-like dental plate divided by a median suture, a slit-like gill opening anterior to the base of the pectoral fin, no pelvic fins, no fin spines, a single usually short-based dorsal fin, a single usually short-based anal fin, and no ribs. They are capable of inflating their abdomens with water when frightened or disturbed and are capable of producing and accumulating toxins such as tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin in the skin, gonads,&#160;and liver. The degree of toxicity varies by species, and also according to geographic area and season (Allen and Randall 1977, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Fishes in the family Tetraodontidae have the smallest vertebrate genomes known to date (Neafsey and Palumbi 2003).</p>","There have been no confirmed population declines in <em>T. plagiocellatus</em>.  However, because of its affinity with coral reefs and seagrass beds, we  infer that it may be experiencing population declines due to habitat  loss in parts of its range.This little known species is likely threatened by coral reef and seagrass habitat losses. As of 2008, fifteen percent of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and the wider Caribbean being the most highly threatened (Wilkinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008). One-third of global seagrass species are currently experiencing population declines, and 21% of globally assessed seagrass species are in threatened or Near Threatened categories primarily due to coastal development and pollution (Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<br/><br/>In addition, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. plagiocellatus</span> may be impacted by the following:<br/><p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines throughout East Asia. Highly effective fishing gear, including modified long-lines and nets with small mesh sizes, rather than excessive fishing effort, have been implicated in the depletion of <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfish resources in parts of East Asia. In Japan, initial efforts to regulate the fishery in the mid-2000s had not achieved desired results by 2010, and were subsequently re-evaluated (Kawata 2012). Although the species-specific effects of the Fugu fishery on <em>T. plagiocellatus&#160;</em>are unknown, it is likely that populations of this commercially important species are impacted by this fishery.</p>  <p><strong>Genetic effects of cultured fish on natural populations</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). Because culture fish are genetically distinct from natural populations, the release of aqua-cultured fish can result in a range of genetic outcomes, from no detectable effect to complete introgression or displacement of wild populations (Hindar <em>et al.</em> 1991). Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> are relatively recently diverged, and each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). It is therefore likely that the effect of intentional and unintentional release of cultured <em>Takifugu </em>on the genetic integrity of wild populations is significant.</p>  <p><strong>Regional threats: environmental degradation and over-fishing</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Major threats to biodiversity of the China seas include over-exploitation of fishery resources and environmental deterioration. The China Seas have faced severe environmental degradation due to a range of anthropogenic activities within a relatively recent and short time frame (Daoji and Daler 2004). The degradation of estuarine environments due to pollution and coastal production is of particular concern, as these areas are characterized by high productivity and represent spawning and nursery areas for many species (Liu 2013). Large areas of the China Seas (Liu 2013) and the Gulf of Thailand (Blaber 2000) are considered to be heavily overfished. Additionally, heavy bottom-trawling in the 1980s and the widespread use of modified driftnets for multi-species fisheries in the Bohai Sea, combined with other anthropogenic stresses, have been implicated in the steady decrease in fish landings in this area (Xianshi 2004). In the Yellow Sea, previously dominant large demersal species became the targets of heavy fishing pressure during the 1950s and 1960s and greatly declined in abundance. By the 1980s, many large pelagic species were also showing great declines in abundance, and since that time the dominant species in the Yellow Sea have been small, planktivorous pelagic species, such as anchovies and sardines (Jin and Tang 1996). In the Yellow Sea, all ecological indexes such as the species number, species richness, species diversity and the evenness were lower in the year 2000 than in the year 1985 (Lin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).</p>","Due to their relatively recent divergence times,&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;interspecific  crosses produced by artificial and natural fertilization in both  natural and laboratory settings were found to be viable (Fujita 1967  Masuda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Miyaki&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1995, Kai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Each&#160;combination of&#160;<em>Takifugu&#160;</em>species is expected to produce fertile hybrid crosses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).<br/><em><br/>Takifugu plagiocellatus</em> was described in 2002 from four specimens (one holotype and three paratypes), which were collected from Xincun, Hainan Province, China. <br/><br/>Coral habitat degradation has been recorded from Hainan Island, China, the one locality where this species is found (need pers. comm).<br/><p><em> Takifugu plagiocellatus</em> is rare in museum collections. No specimens were found in a search of museum collection records. There have been no confirmed population declines in <em>T. plagiocellatus</em>.

It has been recorded at depths ranging from 1–10 metres (Su and Li 2002). The estimated area of occupancy (AOO) of this species is 259 km<sup>2</sup>.","There is no use and trade information available for this species. Other species of the genus are components of the marine aquarium trade.<strong><br/><br/>Aquaculture</strong><br/>There is no evidence that this species is artificially cultured. Fishes of the genus <em>Takifugu</em> have become the focus of increasing aquaculture efforts throughout East Asia. Aquacultured <em>Takifugu</em> are used to meet increasing demand for pufferfish products and to enhance natural populations which have been depleted throughout the region (Kawata <em>et al</em>. 2012). <em>Takifugu</em> pufferfishes, principally represented by the tiger puffer, <em>T. rubripes</em>, are raised in floating net pens in Japan, Korea, and China (Belle and Nash 2009). The total wild catch of pufferfish species in Japan has been relatively stable, ranging from 7,800 to 11,000 tonnes from 1995 to 2002. The four most common species consumed in Japan are <em>T. rubripes</em>, <em>T. snyderi</em>, <em>T. chinensis</em>, and <em>T. porphyreus</em>. Aquaculture efforts focus on <em>T. rubripes</em>, which ranks 5fifth among marine aquacultured species (the top aquacultured species in Japan are: Yellowtail (<em>Seriola quinqueradiata</em>), Red Sea Bream (<em>Pagrus major</em>), coho Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>) and Japanese flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>). Although highly valuable (the market price of <em>T. rubripes</em> is 1.5 times that of Japanese flounder, three times that of yellowtail or seabream), the value began to decrease rapidly from the late 1990s onwards due to importation of Tiger puffer from China. In Japan, the majority of fingerlings produced in commercial hatcheries are then raised in floating net cages for direct consumption. About 15 million fingerlings are produced by commercial hatcheries for aquaculture, 1.5 times higher than the amount produced for release for stock enhancement by semi-governmental hatcheries in 1999. One of the most serious problems in the net cage aquaculture of tiger puffer is high (&gt;50%) mortality from outbreaks of parasitic diseases (Ogawa and Inouye 1997).<strong></strong>",Marine,"<p>There are no known species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Takifugu plagiocellatus</em>, however it is possible that management efforts aimed at sustaining <em>T. rubripes</em> fisheries have benefited <em>T. plagiocellatus</em>.</p>  <p><strong>Fugu fishery</strong><br/> The Fugu fishery is acknowledged to have undergone significant declines. Japan, South Korea and China previously operated their fisheries under a policy which prevented the regulation of foreign fishing vessels and treated the open sea in East Asia as common property. Since 1999, with the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and new fishery agreements between these nations, this policy has shifted to enable coastal countries to regulate foreign fishing vessels. As a result of this policy shift, Japan announced the Plan for Rebuilding Puffer Resources in April 2005, which set dates for an off-fishing season, restrictions on minimum body size, support for stock-enhancement programs, improvements to fishing grounds, and mandated the release of small fishes. As of 2010, stocks had not fully improved, prompting a re-assessment of the program. Several recommendations have been made in order to ensure its continued existence, particularly in light of socio-economic constraints which limit the possibility of developing alternative fisheries. Recommendations include gear restrictions and mandating that fishers catch older and heavier fish by postponing the beginning of the fishing season (Kamara 2012).</p>  <p>In order to sustain fisheries of the East China Sea, the government of China has implemented a number of management and conservation measures. These include establishing a prohibited-fishing zone along the 50-m depth contour, the establishment of seventeen national nature reserves and five special marine protected areas, the creation of fishery protected areas which are annually closed to trawling, and a summer closed-fishing &#160;areas, which prohibit trawling and have been extended to the South China sea, Yellow Sea, and Bohai Sea (Cheng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).</p>  <p><strong>Further research</strong><br/> The economically important genus&#160;<em>Takifugu</em>&#160;has been recommended for further taxonomic studies based on morphological and molecular analyses (Yamanoue&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008), and we support this recommendation.</p>","",,false,false,Global

2365291,19488,Rhincodon typus,Endangered,A2bd+4bd,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>), the world’s largest living fish, is a cosmopolitan tropical and warm temperate species. Genetic results indicate that two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively.<br/><br/>Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present in most of the species’ known coastal feeding areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on counts and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity.<br/><br/>Directed fisheries and significant bycatch fisheries have targeted areas where high densities of Whale Sharks occur, leading to rapid reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) measures. Some bias toward juvenile Whale Shark-dominated aggregations are present in trend data; in the absence of information on other life-stages, these trends are inferred to be representative of population-level declines. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990–2000s, Whale Shark products remain valuable and the species is still commonly caught in some countries. Serious injury and inferred mortality through vessel strike is a threat to several globally significant aggregations, as is bycatch in net fisheries, and the risk of ship strike. In the absence of conservation action, declines is likely to continue into the future.<br/><br/>Based on count data, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, 75% of the global Whale Shark population is inferred to occur in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. A variety of datasets present declines of 40-92%, inferring an overall decline of 63% in the Indo-Pacific over the last 75 years (three generations), resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Endangered A2bd+4bd. In the Atlantic, the overall population decline is considered to be lower at&#160;&#160;≥30%, resulting in a subpopulation assessment of&#160;Vulnerable A2b+4b. Given the bulk of the global population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, the overall global decline is inferred to be&#160;≥50%. Globally, the Whale Shark is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd+4bd.","Whale Sharks are found in both coastal and oceanic habitats (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Oceanic sightings are strongly correlated with temperature in the Indian and Atlantic oceans (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), with most occurring between 26.5° and 30°C in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). Depth was an important predictor in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but was not significant in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Whale Sharks are highly mobile, with mean daily movement rates of 24–28 km based on tethered geopositioning tags (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cyclical or longer-term climate shifts affect Whale Shark occurrence and abundance (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), which needs to be considered when discussing local abundance trends.<br/><br/>Whale Sharks spend the majority of time in the epipelagic zone, but dive to at least 1,928 m in depth (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). The driver of these deep dives is unclear, but may be related to foraging behaviour, especially when crossing oceanic waters with comparatively low surface productivity (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brunnschweiler and Sims 2011, Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015) and/or assist with energy conservation when moving between prey zones (Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2011) or navigating (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). Initial results from fatty acid dietary studies suggest that meso- and bathypelagic prey may be an important component of Whale Shark diet (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013), and dive data from pop-up archival tags provide some evidence for mesopelagic foraging behaviour (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Most Whale Shark sightings occur at a small number of known coastal feeding areas for the species, where the sharks aggregate on the surface to exploit seasonal productivity such as fish spawning events or zooplankton blooms (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A degree of inter-annual site fidelity has been documented in many locations (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Sexual- and size-based segregation is typical in these locations, with a bias towards juvenile males from 4–8 m length (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). This pronounced segregation indicates that ontogenetic and sex-specific habitat or dietary shifts are present in the species. In the Gulf of California, juvenile sharks, comprising 60% males, were found in shallower waters exploiting abundant prey. Larger sharks, composed of 84% females, occurred in oceanic waters where they fed on diffuse patches of euphasiids (Ketchum <em>et al</em>. 2012). An initial stable isotope study of Indian Whale Sharks showed a positive relationship between size and δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N, suggesting that larger sharks feed on prey items of a larger size and higher trophic level (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females had lower values of δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N than males (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggesting that they have a different, more pelagic diet, while individuals of &lt;4 m total length (TL) also showed a lower δ13C than larger individuals suggesting a transition from pelagic to more coastal foraging habitats.<br/><br/>The largest recorded Whale Shark, approximately 20 m TL (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997) and 42 t in mass (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), have been reported from Taiwan. An individual extrapolated to be 18.8 m TL was caught in India (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Norman and Stevens (2007) found that 50% of males were mature, based on clasper morphology, at a visually estimated TL of 8.1 m in Western Australia, while 50% maturity was estimated to occur at 9.2 m TL using laser photogrammetry in Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Gulf of Mexico, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) visually estimated 50% male maturity to occur at around 7 m TL. Given the genetic differentiation between the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014), this may represent a subpopulation-level difference in the size of maturation. Size at maturity in female sharks is approximately 9 m TL, based on visual (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012) and laser photogrammetric estimates (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) from the Eastern Pacific, and a 9.6 m TL individual recorded from Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014). All of seven stranded female specimens from 4.8 to 8.7 m TL in South Africa were immature (Beckley <em>et al</em>. 1997). The only confirmed pregnant female examined, from Taiwan, was 10.6 m TL (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996).<br/><br/>Whale Shark reproductive ecology is poorly known. Pregnant female sharks are seasonally found in the Eastern Pacific, particularly off Darwin Island in the Galapagos Archipelago (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) and the Gulf of California (Eckert and Stewart 2001, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012), but rarely sighted outside this region. An exception is St Helena Island in the mid-Atlantic, where pregnant female sharks are routinely observed on a seasonal basis (A. Dove, pers. comm). The single pregnant female that has been physically examined, from Taiwan, had 304 pups in various stages of development, the largest litter size reported from any shark species (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). This discovery established that Whale Sharks are aplacental viviparous. Paternity analysis on a subset of the offspring established that a single male might have sired the entire litter, suggesting that the species has the capacity to store sperm (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). The largest size class of embryos, 58–64 cm TL, appeared close to fully developed (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996). The smallest free-swimming neonate found in the wild, from the Philippines, was 46 cm TL (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Size at birth is therefore presumed to be around this range (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Reproductive periodicity is unknown: resightings rarely occur in the areas where pregnant sharks are observed (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>Age and growth data on Whale Shark are sparse. Stranded sharks in South Africa (Wintner 2000) and fishery catches in Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), respectively, have been assessed. Both studies were limited by small sample sizes of predominantly juvenile sharks. Hsu <em>et al</em>. (2014) concluded that growth band deposition is likely to be biannual and, based on this, estimated that male sharks begin maturing at ~17 years and females at 19–22 years in the Indo-Pacific. However, these estimates have some important caveats: biannual band deposition has been demonstrated in very few other shark species, and other orectolobiform species have been shown to have aperiodic band pair formation (Huveneers <em>et al</em>. 2013). Validation through wild growth studies is important to confirm these results. Initial results from laser photogrammetric studies indicate that growth increments over periods of 1–3 years are too small to be accurately measured, but the technique may have value over longer time-frames (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). Generation length is estimated as 25 years.","Major contemporary threats to Whale Sharks include fisheries catches, bycatch in nets, and vessel strikes. Other threats affect Whale Shark on local or regional scales.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks are presently fished in several locations. In southern China, large-scale commercial take of Whale Sharks appears to be increasing (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although Whale Sharks are not necessarily targeted, they are routinely captured and retained when sighted (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small-scale opportunistic fishery for Whale Sharks is also present in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm).&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks have previously been targeted in large-scale fisheries from India, the Philippines and Taiwan, with hundreds of sharks caught annually in each country until species-level protections were implemented (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A smaller directed fishery occurred in the Maldives until Whale Sharks were protected in 1995 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Broader-scale subpopulation reduction caused by these fisheries was raised as a possible driver of declining sightings in Thailand (Theberge and Dearden 2006) and Western Australia (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Occasional directed catch or bycatch of Whale Sharks has been documented from many of their range states, particularly where large-mesh gillnets are in common use (Rowat and Brooks 2012).<br/><br/>Tuna are often associated with Whale Sharks, and tuna purse-seine fisheries often use Whale Sharks as an indicator of tuna presence, even setting nets around the sharks (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Direct mortality in purse-seine fisheries appears to generally be low, recorded as 0.91% (one of 107) and 2.56% (one of 38) of sharks where fate was reported by observers in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, estimated mortality rates in the Western Central Pacific purse-seine fishery were higher: 12% for 2007–2009 and 5% in 2010. This extrapolated to a total mortality of 56 sharks in 2009 and 19 in 2010 (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). Observer reports on release condition from this region from 2010–2014 were generally consistent, with 50–60% of encircled sharks released alive, 5–10% dying and 30–40% of status unknown (Clarke 2015). Assuming a poor outcome for the latter category, potential mortalities in 2014 range from a minimum of 11 to 42, with a higher number possible depending on longer-term survival of the sharks released alive (Clarke 2015). Available data on the number of Whale Sharks caught are likely to underestimate total catch (Clarke 2015). The longer-term survivorship of Whale Sharks released from nets has not been examined at this stage. Common release practices, such as being lifted or towed by the caudal peduncle, are likely to cause stress, injury and possibly death to the sharks.<br/><br/>Shipping lanes, where they are placed close to Whale Shark feeding areas, can create a serious risk of vessel strikes. Whale Sharks routinely feed at the surface (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2013), and propeller injuries are commonly recorded during monitoring programs (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2006, Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). While mortality events are seldom reported in the contemporary scientific literature, they were often noted from slower-moving vessels in the past (Gudger 1941). It is likely that fast-moving, large ships do not register or report impacts, and as Whale Sharks will typically sink upon death, these are unlikely to be documented (Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008). Areas where Whale Sharks appear to be at particular risk include the Mesoamerican reef countries in the Western Caribbean (Graham 2007, R. de la Parra-Venegas pers. comm.) and Gulf states (D. Robinson pers. comm.), where a high frequency of serious propeller injuries are observed during monitoring.<br/>&#160;<br/>Inappropriate tourism may be an indirect threat to Whale Shark in some circumstances (for example from interference, crowding or provisioning). Marine pollution events occurring in Whale Shark hotspots, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2012), may result in mortality or displacement from preferred habitats. These more local threats, as well as potential future concerns such as climate change impacts (Sequiera <em>et al</em>. 2014), should be closely monitored.","Based on counts, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, it is inferred that approximately 75% of the global Whale Shark population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific, a population reduction of 63% is inferred over the last three generations (75 years), and in the Atlantic a population reduction of more than 30% is inferred (see the discussion for each subpopulation below). Combining data from both regions, it is likely that the global Whale Shark population has declined by &gt;50% over the last 75 years.<br/><br/>Available datasets for Whale Sharks, in particular those from coastal sites, are typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. Acknowledging this, we make the assumption that trend data in the visible fraction of the population (i.e. mainly juveniles) is representative of the adult population. <br/><br/><em><strong>Global population size</strong></em><br/>Whale Sharks are individually identifiable based on their characteristic spot patterns (Taylor 1994, Arzoumanian <em>et al</em>. 2005, Marshall and Pierce 2012). A global database of Whale Shark sightings, comprising submitted photographs from both researchers and the public, is hosted online at Wildbook for Whale Sharks (<a href=""www.whaleshark.org"">www.whaleshark.org</a>) (Wild Me 2016, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). As of February 2016, there were 7,011 individual sharks on this database, identified from images submitted between 1964 and 2016. However, 70% of sexed individuals (n = 3,420) were male, with the majority of these likely to be immature based on length estimates (Norman and Stevens 2007, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). This dataset is assumed to not fully represent female, small juvenile or adult sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Therefore, the total represents a minimum number of sharks alive over this period.<br/><br/>Two global-scale genetic studies on Whale Sharks have estimated genetic effective population size – the number of breeding adults – albeit based on small sample sizes of 70 (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2007) and 68 sharks (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2009), respectively. Castro <em>et al</em>. (2007) used mitochondrial DNA to estimate current genetic effective population size to be 119,000–238,000 sharks. Schmidt <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated genetic effective population size to be 103,572, with a standard error of 27,401–179,794, based on microsatellite analysis. However, lack of knowledge on species-specific mutation rates mean these estimates should not be used for management purposes (J. Schmidt pers. comm., T. Vignaud and S. Planes pers. comm).<br/><br/><em><strong>Global population structure</strong></em><br/>While global connectivity of Whale Shark subpopulations has been postulated (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013b), a large global genetic study using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analysis has demonstrated that the Whale Shark subpopulations in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are functionally separate (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-scale photo-identification studies in the Indian Ocean (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010) and western Atlantic (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), along with Wildbook online database results (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), have shown limited connectivity exists between non-contiguous countries. Based on these results, here we have considered two separate subpopulations in this assessment.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation trend<br/></strong></em>A decline of  ≥30% in the Atlantic subpopulation is inferred over the last three generations (75 years) based on data from tuna fleet observers off a likely centre of abundance for this subpopulation. Between 1980 and 2010 there was a decline in sightings per unit effort (SPUE) off western Africa, with SPUE peaking in 1995 and declining thereafter (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, sightings decreased from about 500 during the 1990s to around 150 during the 2000s. Peak-month sightings also declined by approximately 50% over this time (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>At Gladden Spit in Belize, Whale Shark sightings declined from a mean of 4 to 6 sharks per day between 1998 and 2001 to less than 2 per day in 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), with reports from diving guides indicating that numbers have remained low until 2016 (R. Graham, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the Azores, there was a significant increase in sightings in 2008 and afterwards compared to the decade before (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This was strongly correlated with the location of the 22°C isotherm, indicating that this increasing sighting trend is due to environmental conditions (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation size</strong></em><br/>Regional counts of identified sharks or modelled abundance estimates are available from many of the larger known aggregation or feeding areas. Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) photo-identified 350 individual Whale Sharks from Holbox Island in Mexico between 2005 and 2008, and estimated that 521–809 sharks participate in this aggregation. Aerial surveys from this area and the adjacent Caribbean coast have counted up to 420 sharks in a single aerial survey (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011). The largest-known aggregation as of February 2016 occurs seasonally off the Yucatan cost of Mexico, with over 1,100 identified sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Satellite-tagged sharks from this aggregation have been tracked to the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), where aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been reported (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005), south to Belize where 106 individual sharks were identified between 1998 and 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), and off the island of Utila, Honduras, where 95 sharks were identified between 1999 and 2011 (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). One shark, tagged in 2007, was tracked swimming across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The end point of this track was 543 km southeast from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, where 54 Whale Shark sightings were recorded between 2000 and 2005 (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 2008). This individual was subsequently photo-identified back off the Yucatan coast in 2011 and 2012 (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Aside from St Helena Island (A. Dove, pers. comm.), there have been few photographic records from elsewhere in the Atlantic (Wild Me 2016). There were, however, 2,297 records of Whale Sharks from the logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels between 1980 and 2010, mostly from the eastern Atlantic (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014) and particularly off the coast of Gabon (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). An additional 1,449 sightings were recorded from the Azores archipelago between 1998 and 2013 (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation trend</strong></em><br/>A decline of &gt;50% (likely around 63%) in the Indo-Pacific Whale Shark subpopulation is inferred&#160;over the last three generations (75 years)&#160;based on relevant indices of abundance from Mozambique, the broader Western Indian Ocean, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the Western and Central Pacific, and actual levels of exploitation in mainland China, the Maldives, India, the Philippines and Taiwan.<br/><br/>A commercial fishery for Whale Shark existed in Taiwan until 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Information provided by fishers operating from Hongchun harbour in southern Taiwan indicated that 50–60 sharks were caught each season in the mid-1980s, declining to less than 10 per year in each of 1994 and 1995 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Although definitive catch trends are not available, there was a significant (58%) decrease in the estimated annual catch in 1997 of 272 sharks (Chen and Phipps 2002) to a reported catch of 113 sharks over 15 months in 2001–2002 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean total length of landed sharks was noted between 2002 and 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean size of landed sharks was also noted in southern Chinese waters, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 6.3 m in 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Data from observers aboard the tuna purse-seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific noted 1,073 Whale Shark sightings, with most from the Bismark and Solomon Seas (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). The occurrence of Whale Shark in free school sets decreased by approximately 50% between 2003 (1%) and 2012 (0.5%), potentially representing a fall in abundance (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material), although a weak linear increase in occurrence probability was modelled by Sequeira <em>et al</em>. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, model performance for this latter dataset was poor (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The influence of environmental variability on sightings of Whale Shark can complicate the interpretation of trend data, particularly with the shortage of long-term datasets. A decline in Whale Shark sightings along the eastern coast of South Africa between 1993 and 1998 (Gifford 2001) was included in the proposal for listing the sharks on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2002). However, with the benefit of hindsight, the substantial variability in sighting data from this area over summer months (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 2007) and seasonal changes in their oceanic distribution (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), makes it unclear whether these earlier data are indicative of a true subpopulation decline. North of this area, in the northern Mozambique Channel and broader western Indian Ocean, a slight increase in Whale Shark sightings was noted between 1991 and 2000 based on tuna purse-seine vessel data, then a decrease from 2000 to 2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, 600 sightings were reported from the 1990s decreasing to ~200 across 2000–2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Peak monthly sightings decreased by around 50% over the study period (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Inhambane, Mozambique, in the southern Mozambique Channel, sightings declined 79% between 2005 and 2011 (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This decreased rate of sightings has persisted to at least January 2016 (S. Pierce, unpubl. data). Sharks routinely move between South Africa and southern Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), but there is limited or no connectivity between these and other known coastal feeding areas to the north in Djibouti, Seychelles and Tanzania (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Prior to the species being protected in the Maldives in 1995, catches of Whale Shark declined from around 30 each year from one of the significant fishing locations up until the early 1980s to a catch of 20 or less Whale Sharks from the entire archipelago by 1993 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Two hundred and fifty-three Whale Shark sightings were recorded by a local dive charter company in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, between 1991 and 2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Sightings per unit effort showed a significant decline over this period, with an overall decrease from 1.58 Whale Sharks per trip in 1992–1993 to 0.13 sharks per trip in 2000–2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A low absolute number of sightings persisted until at least the 2002–2003 season, although effort data were not recorded (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Following the conclusion of data collection for that study, shark sightings have likely increased in frequency according to reports from dive operators. However, sharks are perceived to be smaller than those sighted in the 1990s (P. Dearden, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) analysed tourism sightings at Ningaloo Reef, Australia, between 1995 and 2004, corrected for search effort and environmental fluctuation, and identified a 40% decline in sighting rate and a decline in mean shark length of 1.6 m over this time period (Table 1 in the supplementary material), although seasonal shifts in peak abundance to outside observation months may also have contributed to this observed decline (Mau and Wilson 2007, Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Analysis of individual sighting data from 1995 to 2006 identified behavioural heterogeneity in the sharks at Ningaloo, with the majority showing some site fidelity in that they were sighted in multiple seasons (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). This (majority) subset of the study population was increasing over the course of this work (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). Follow-up analyses on a slightly longer dataset (1995 to 2008) confirmed this result, with smaller individuals contributing in larger numbers to recruitment, thereby potentially explaining the observed decline in mean size (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009; Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, a genetic study on Ningaloo sharks indicated declining genetic diversity over five consecutive years for mtDNA (2007–2012) and two (2010–2012) for microsatellites (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Whale Sharks were fished in the Philippines prior to protection in 1998, with Whale Shark catch per unit effort (i.e., per boat) declining from 4.44 to 1.7 in Pamilacan and 10 to 3.8 in Guiwanon between two surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation size<br/></strong></em>Six hundred and seventy sharks were photo-identified in southern Mozambique between 2003 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Mafia Island in Tanzania, 131 sharks were photo-identified between 2006 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Djibouti, 297 individuals were photo-identified between 2003 and 2010 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011), while 443 individuals were photo-identified off Mahe in the Seychelles between 2001 and 2009 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011). A subset of the Seychelles dataset, comprising records from 2004 to 2009, was modelled to produce an abundance estimate of 469 to 557 sharks from that area (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Comparisons of identities collected from the Seychelles, Djibouti, Tanzania and Mozambique, comprising a total of 1,069 individual sharks sighted up to 2009, found no matches between these countries (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Norman <em>et al</em>. (submitted) updated these figures and found three international matches (all between Mozambique and Tanzania) from 1,098 individuals. A significant aggregation of juvenile Whale Sharks also occurs in the Red Sea off the Saudi Arabian coast, with 122 individuals identified to 2013 (J. Cochran, pers. comm). Aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been noted off the Qatar coast (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013). One hundred and six sharks have been identified around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2010, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012), with a modelled abundance estimate of around 74 to 104 sharks (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012). There were 1,184 Whale Shark sightings in the Indian Ocean recorded by tuna purse-seine vessel logbooks between 1991 and 2007, with almost all of these from the Western Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Eighty-two sightings were recorded off Christmas Island, Australia, between 1996 and 2008 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale shark photo-identifications range back to the early 1990s off Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009). Three hundred and eighty-six sharks were identified here between 1995 and 2008 (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009), with over 1,000 sharks identified by 2015 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Although two satellite-tagged sharks were tracked moving from Ningaloo Reef to the vicinity of Christmas Island (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010), no exchange of photo-identified sharks has been documented to date (Wild Me 2016). One photo-identified Whale Shark was, however, recorded from both Ningaloo Reef and Borneo (B. Norman, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Whale Shark abundance at Ningaloo Reef, Australia has been modelled by two studies. Meekan <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated super-population size to be 319 to 436 sharks between 1992 and 2004. Holmberg <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated annual abundance to vary between 86 and 143 sharks in the years 2004 to 2007, when length was used as a covariate. Whale Shark abundance in this area is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and several other oceanographic variables, which potentially relate to the strength of ocean currents and local productivity (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Over 820 individual sharks have now been photo-identified from the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), with large aggregations recorded from around Donsol (Quiros 2007), Oslob on Cebu Island (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014, Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and Pintuyan on Southern Leyte (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Excluding the Philippines, 326 sharks have been photo-identified from Southeast Asia (here including Cambodia [3], Indonesia [64], Malaysia [32], Myanmar [4], Taiwan [7] and both coasts of Thailand [216]) and added to the global database by February 2016 (Wild Me 2016).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Eastern Pacific, Whale Sharks are seasonally present in small numbers around Darwin and Wolf islands in the north of the Galapagos Archipelago (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. (2014) identified 82 individuals here from 2011–2013 and estimated an annual study population size of 695±166 individuals for the Galapagos Islands. Males and immature females are rarely observed at this location, so this estimate refers predominantly to large, apparently pregnant females (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two hundred and fifty-one individual sharks were photo-identified in the Gulf of California, Mexico, between 2003 and 2009: 129 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, 125 from Bahía de La Paz and smaller numbers from other sites (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Modelled abundance estimates from this dataset were 54 in 2008 and 94 sharks in 2009 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, and between 19 and 62 through 2005–2009 at Bahía de La Paz (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside of these areas (Galapagos Islands and Mexico), few photo-identified sharks have been added to the global database from the Eastern Pacific (Wild Me 2016). Twenty-five whale sharks were reported from tuna purse-seine vessel observers in 2014 (Clarke 2015).",Decreasing,"The Whale Shark has a circumtropical distribution through all tropical and warm temperate seas, apart from the Mediterranean (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Their core distribution is between approximately 30°N and 35°S, with occasional seasonal penetration to the north and south (Colman 1997, Rowat and Brooks 2012, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). The northernmost records are from 44°N in the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Turnbull and Randell 2006) and the Sea of Okhotsk off Japan (Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014), with the southernmost from 37°S in Victoria, Australia (Wolfson 1986). Whale Shark distribution is likely to be temperature limited, as they are rarely sighted in surface temperatures of less than 21°C (Iwasaki 1970, Colman 1997, Duffy 2002, Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014, Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Areas where 500 or more individuals have been documented through either counts or model estimates include the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Robinson <em>et al</em>. in review), Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), Darwin Island in the Galapagos (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014), Quintana Roo in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012), Inhambane province in Mozambique (Norman et al. submitted), the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and around Mahe in the Seychelles (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Evidence from fisheries catches indicates that the Gujarat coast of India (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2012), Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012) and southern China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012) also had large numbers of Whale Sharks in the vicinity, at least prior to the initiation of targeted fisheries in those countries, with estimated catches of up to 1,000 individuals per year (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Indian Ocean, data from the tuna purse-seine fleet has identified the Mozambique Channel as having a high density of Whale Shark-associated sets (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Whale Shark sightings were correlated with effort (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Modelled habitat suitability was highest in the eastern Atlantic in the area off Gabon and surrounding countries (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bismark and Solomon Seas have relatively frequent Whale Shark sightings within the Western and Central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Whale Sharks are subject to large- and small-scale bycatch in fisheries, with some national and international trade in products. They are also a focal species for marine tourism industries.<br/><br/>The only known targeted fishery for Whale Sharks to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean was located in Santa Cruz, Cuba, where 8–9 sharks were caught each year until the fishery was banned in 1991 (Graham 2007). Aside from Venezuela, where Whale Sharks were occasionally harpooned by fishers (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2000), there are few other records of utilization or trade of individuals from this subpopulation.<br/><br/>Prior to 1985, there was little demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan, with specimens of several tonnes weight selling at between US$200–300 (Chen and Phipps 2002). No dedicated fishery was present, though Whale Sharks were caught as bycatch in set-net fisheries (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A meat fishery developed during the 1990s, with annual catches estimated to be 272 individuals in 1996 from set-net and harpoon catches (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Total catches were likely to be higher (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Whale Shark became the most expensive shark meat available in Taiwan by 1997, reaching prices of US$13.93/kg (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A small 2 t Whale Shark could fetch US$14,000, with a larger 10 t shark selling for around US$70,000 in 1997 (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Catches declined after this peak, potentially due to local stock depletion, to 80–100 sharks through the country each year after 1997 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, the annual volume of Whale Shark meat traded more than doubled between 1998 and 2000, to 60 t in 2000 (Chen and Phipps 2002). Market surveys in 2001 indicated that catch was under-reported in official statistics, and that significant quantities of meat were likely being imported through unofficial channels (Chen and Phipps 2002). Following the introduction of specific export codes for Whale Shark meat in 2001, 2 tonnes of exports (to Spain, valued at US$1.15/kg) and no imports were recorded over the following year (Chen and Phipps 2002). A total of 693 sharks were caught in Taiwan between 2001 and 2008 (Hsu et al. 2012). Total allowable catch quotas steadily reduced through to zero sharks from 2001 to 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small international trade in live Whale Shark was also noted in Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002), and is also present in mainland China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Prior to the protection of Whale Shark in India (2001) and the Philippines (1998), Whale Shark meat was exported from those countries to Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002). From 1990 to 1997, 624–627 Whale Shark were caught from four of the primary fishing sites in the Philippines (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002). Whale Shark meat from mainland China was also thought to be illegally exported to the Taiwanese market (Chen and Phipps 2002). While Whale Shark is not presently targeted off mainland China, there is a large bycatch, estimated to be more than 1,000 individuals per annum (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark is considered a high value catch in this fishery, so they may be actively targeted in the future (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although the species is technically protected, catches are unmonitored and enforcement is minimal (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A reduction in the mean size of landings has been reported, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 5.5 m from 2004–2007 and 6.3 m from 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is unclear whether this apparent decrease in mean catch length reflects a decrease in landings of large sharks.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Whale Shark fins were regarded as low value due to poor quality and the difficulty of preparation (Chen and Phipps 2002). Demand for fins within trade was minimal, although they were sometimes sold as display or trophy fins for shark-fin soup restaurants (Chen and Phipps 2002). More recent surveys have reported that Whale Shark fins are now demanding high prices, which is likely to result in increased targeting (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark fins are sporadically seen in Hong Kong markets (G. Curtis, pers. comm.), indicating that international trade in Whale Shark fins is still likely to be occurring. The source of these fins is unknown. A live shark was seen with a recently removed first dorsal fin in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale Shark were also opportunistically finned in Indonesia in the 2000s (White and Cavanagh 2007).<br/><br/>The Whale Shark fishery in India was reviewed by Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. (2013). A traditional small-scale seasonal harpoon fishery in India took Whale Shark for their liver oil, which was used to waterproof boats. In the mid 1990s, fishery effort increased along the Gujarat coast to meet demand for oil, meat and fins from countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. From 1990 until 2001, when Whale Shark became legally protected in territorial waters, there was a targeted commercial fishery in Gujarat. Between 1889 and 1998, 1,974 sharks were recorded as landed through India. Some bycatch still occurs following the closure of this fishery, with 79 landings from 2001 to 2011 (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A small opportunistic fishery is active in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm). Small-scale harpoon and entanglement fisheries for Whale Sharks have taken place in several other countries such as Iran and Pakistan (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Recent landings in these areas are unknown. Fishers in the Maldives used to take 20–30 individuals per year for their oil, but reported declining catches during the 1980s to early 1990s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993), and the fishery was banned in 1995. Occasional hunting may have continued following protection (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Tourism industries based on viewing Whale Shark have now developed in several countries or locations, including Australia, Belize, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Honduras, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mexico, Mozambique, Oman, Panama, the Philippines, St Helena, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Thailand. These range in size between a maximum of 24 tourists at a time in Cuba (Graham 2007), to over 250 licensed tour operators off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Direct expenditure for Whale Shark-focused tourism at South Ari Atoll in the Maldives was estimated at US$9.4 million in 2013 (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2014), while payments for tours alone off Quintana Roo in Mexico were estimated to be US$7 million in 2013 (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm). In Western Australia, whale shark tourists spent an estimated AU$6 million in the Ningaloo region in 2006 (Catlin and Jones 2010). Tourist numbers have since doubled, from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 per year, so expenditure will also have substantially increased (B. Norman, unpubl. data). Graham (2007) projected that, globally, Whale Shark tourism was likely to be worth over US$42 million annually. Rapid increases in the numbers of tour participants in some key locations, such as in Mexico (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm.), Australia (D. Robb, pers. comm.) and the Philippines (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicate that the industry is growing fast in economic importance.",Marine,"The Whale Shark has been listed in a number of international conventions and agreements. The species is included in Annex I (Highly Migratory Species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a framework for the conservation and management of fisheries, and other uses of the seas. To date, no management initiatives enacted through UNCLOS have included the Whale Shark. Under the aegis of this convention, the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was introduced in 1995, which has potential for direct actions to be taken in relation to species such as Whale Shark, although none have yet been proposed (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Also in 1995, the FAO finalized a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and then in 1998 the International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Davidson <em>et al</em>. (2015) noted that only 22 National Plans Of Action had been published at that time, limiting the effectiveness of this initiative.<br/><br/>The Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 1999. This identifies it as a migratory species whose unfavourable conservation status would benefit from the implementation of international cooperative agreements. The CMS has provided a forum for the development of more direct conservation approaches with the adoption, in 2010, of a Memorandum of Understanding on the migratory shark species listed on this agreement, including Whale Shark. There were 40 signatories to this memorandum as of February 2016, which aims to improve scientific knowledge, ensure fisheries sustainability, protect critical habitats, movement corridors and life stages of sharks, while increasing public participation and national, regional and international cooperation towards these objectives. Whale Shark routinely move across political boundaries (summarised in Rowat and Brooks 2012), emphasising the importance of this unified approach.<br/><br/>Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002. This requires fishing states to demonstrate that any exports were derived from a sustainably managed population, enabling exports and imports to be monitored through a permit system. Continued presence of Whale Shark fins in Hong Kong markets, a major international transit point, despite no records in the CITES Wildlife Trade Database (http://trade.cites.org) suggests that illegal trade is occurring outside the CITES permit system. No Whale Shark fisheries have been certified as sustainable under CITES Appendix II regulations. Identifying the source of these fins, and enforcing CITES regulations, should be a key goal for managers.<br/><br/>National- or territory-level management measures for Whale Shark, via shark fishing bans or specific species protection, are in place in American Samoa, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Cambodia, Chagos Archipelago (UK), China, Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Kuwait, Maldives, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Reunion, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, St Helena Island (UK), Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau, United Arab Emirates and USA. Species-level legislative protection is an important conservation goal in countries where Whale Shark are still caught, either as a target or bycatch, including China, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan and Tanzania.<br/><br/>While many of the larger commercial fisheries for Whale Sharks have now ceased, primarily due to rapid catch reductions, fishery and trade management is still required. The active fishery in Chinese waters is almost certainly unsustainable (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). This national fishery is likely to be the largest single direct threat to Whale Shark recovery in the Indo-Pacific. Enforcement of existing laws for Whale Shark protection, and education and awareness programmes for fishers, will be an important component of management there.<br/><br/>Key habitats for Whale Sharks, in the form of coastal feeding locations or movement corridors, are protected in Australia (Ningaloo Reef), Belize (Gladden Spit), Costa Rica (Cocos Island), Ecuador (Galapagos Islands), Mexico (Yum-Balam Biosphere Reserve), Panama (Coiba Island) and the UK (St Helena Island). Site protection is necessary in some areas where high densities of Whale Sharks are present, as anthropogenic pressures on these sites could have disproportionate impact on subpopulation declines. Important aggregation areas for Whale Sharks in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), Mozambique (Haskell <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Qatar (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013) are examples. Where Whale Sharks are routinely feeding on the surface, such as off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), these areas should also be managed to reduce vessel strikes in nearby shipping lanes. This could entail either seasonal ‘go-slow zones’, or moving these routes to avoid the shark aggregations. Protection of the specific biological phenomena that influence Whale Shark presence at many aggregation sites, such as fish spawning events (Heyman <em>et al</em>. 2001, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013), would also help to safeguard these habitats.<br/><br/>Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) have banned the intentional setting of purse-seine nets around Whale Shark in the Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific (WCP) and Indian Oceans, though not yet in the Atlantic Ocean (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, a large proportion of entangled Whale Sharks (73% in WCP; SPC-OFP 2012) were not sighted prior to nets being deployed. Therefore, fisher education and regulation on safe release practices should be a key management goal. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission require that best practices for safe release of Whale Sharks be followed when they are accidentally encircled (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014), and similar guidelines were endorsed by Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission members in 2015. All RFMOs should prohibit the deliberate setting of nets around Whale Sharks, and require that Whale Sharks be safely released when they are caught accidentally (i.e., using updated recommendations following Poisson <em>et al</em>. (2014) and the summary of guidelines by Clarke 2015). Fisher education and training initiatives would be useful to facilitate implementation.<br/><br/>Whale Shark tourism is managed through legislation in Australia, Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and St Helena Island (UK). At the time of writing, whale shark tourism was not legal in Qatar, where whale shark aggregations occur in a restricted oil field (Robinson et al. 2013). Voluntary codes of conduct exist in many other tourism locations. As tourism can increase the risk of boat strikes, due to the close proximity of boats and sharks, enforcing minimum approach distances for vessels can help to reduce shark stress (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2010) and reduce the probability of boat strike. Similarly, enforcing general codes of practice for tourism industries will help to ensure their sustainability.<br/><br/>In some areas, such as China, India, Mozambique, Taiwan and Tanzania, the close proximity of whale shark feeding areas or movement corridors with net fisheries leads to regular incidental bycatch. Restrictions on mesh size, net length and fishing locations can help to avoid whale shark catch. Training in safe release, or provision of bycatch reduction technologies (deliberate weak points in nets or other ways to avoid entanglement) could help to reduce the likelihood of shark injury or mortality when interactions occur.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Little is known on its habitat, population, and ecology, however, the area off Progreso is characterized as shallow and sandy and it was taken directly from a coral reef in 2010. Its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 4,386 km² and it is known from only two small reef systems. Based on this, it qualifies for Endangered under criterion B1. <br/><br/>Since this species was last recorded off Progreso, a very large pier complex was constructed within its capture locality. This action likely impacted the coastal environments surrounding it. Furthermore, large cruise vessels that dock nearby and pollution from an increasing nearby human population may be attributing to continual habitat decline. Madagascar Reef is not known to be particularly impacted and is located relatively far offshore. Therefore, it is listed as Endangered (EN B1ab(iii)). Further research on the status of this species' population is much needed.","Little information is available regarding its habitat and ecology due to the fact that the description of this species was based on museum records. The type locality is within the vicinity of Terminal Remota, a four mile long pier used by large cruise ships. It should be noted that the construction of this pier was not completed until 12 years after the last time this species was recorded in this locality. It is possible that this caused an extensive alteration of the shoreline and associated shallow habitats which this species utilizes. Other species within this genus are associated with coral reefs (B. Collette pers. comm. 2011) and it was most recently collected with clove oil from a coral reef (Zarco-Perello <em>et al</em>. 2014). The maximum size recorded is 23.6 cm standard length (SL) (McEachran and Fechhelm 2005).","Previously on The IUCN Red List, this species was listed as Vulnerable (Roberts 1996). Due to its shallow distribution, rarity and restricted range, it is inherently susceptible to a number of nearshore threats such as pollution and coastal modification. The construction of Terminal Remota (a very large pier complex), which was completed in 1989, likely impacted the shallow habitat that this species occupies. In addition, the docking of large cruise ships and a burgeoning tourist population has increased significantly in Progreso.<br/><br/>Zarco-Perello <em>et al</em>. (2013) hypothesized that the corals in Madagascar Reef are stressed, however, the cause is not suspected to be anthropogenic in nature. Also, underwater photos of the reef system, show it not to be in very good condition (B. Collette pers. comm. 2015).","This species is only known from a total of six specimens.

The species has low biological productivity with late age-at-maturity and a long reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries and is often retained for the meat and fins. Steep declines have occurred in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian&#160;Ocean, and to a lesser degree, in the Western Indian&#160;Ocean; trends in the Eastern Atlantic off West Africa are suspected to be declining.

The areas with available abundance trend data are relatively small    compared to the global distribution, and abundance trends are unknown in parts of its distribution.

Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (McCandless <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is often retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, <em></em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The  species is taken in recreational fishing and beach protection programs  that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, McCandless<em> et al. </em>2014).  At-vessel mortality was estimated at 34% in the US pelagic  longline fishery, 81% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery,  and 1.3% on Western Australia demersal longlines (McCandless <em>et al.</em>  2014, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). Post-release mortality was estimated  as up to 67% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery, though  markedly reduced when individuals were retained for less than 3 hours on the line  (McCandless <em>et al.</em> 2014).","There are no data on the global population size of the Dusky Shark. Genetic studies support two subpopulations of Dusky Shark, the Northwest Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific (Benavides <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2012, McCandless <em>et al.</em> 2014), although where other parts of the Atlantic fit into this structuring is unknown. No genetic structure was found within the Northwest Atlantic between the USA east coast and the Gulf of Mexico (Benavides <em>et al</em>. 2011, McCandless <em>et al</em>. 2014), or between Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Junge <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>Population trend data are available from three sources:<strong> </strong>(1) stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic (SEDAR 2016); (2) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Eastern Indian Ocean (Braccini and O'Malley 2018);<strong> </strong>and, (3) standardized CPUE in the Western Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al. </em>2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).    <p>First, the stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic estimated the stock is overfished and overfishing has been occurring since the mid-1980s with a prohibition on catches in 2000 that has reduced, but not ceased, the overfishing (SEDAR 2016). The trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic relative biomass for 1960–2015 (56 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 89.9% over three generation lengths (89.4 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>Second, the Eastern Indian Ocean stock in Western Australia was previously subject to overfishing, with catch levels in the 1990s likely unsustainable (Simpfendorfer 1999, McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2007). The stock is now considered to be recovering following measures implemented in 2006 to reduce catches of juvenile and older Dusky Sharks, and an increase in CPUE in the latter years of the time-series; a stock assessment (in preparation) indicates that the stock should recover under the current level of fishing mortality (SAFS 2018, Braccini and O'Malley 2018). The Eastern Indian Ocean data includes Bronze Whaler (<em>Carcharhinus brachyurus</em>) prior to 2006, however it forms a minor part of the catch and does not affect the CPUE trend (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003). The trend analysis of the Eastern Indian Ocean CPUE for 1975–2015 (41 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 98.7% over three generation lengths (114 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<span lang=""EN-US""> This probability of a high level of reduction is over  a very long period of three generations; it has incorporated the  reductions from historically higher abundances and projected an  estimated trend based on those reductions for a considerable period  beyond that of the time-series, and is thus indicative of historic  declines rather than the stable and increasing trend since 2006.<br/></p><p>Third, the Western Indian Ocean standardized CPUE from the South Africa beach protection program was fairly stable from 1978–2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend analysis of the Western Indian Ocean CPUE for 1978–2003 (26 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.9%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 60.9% over three generation lengths (114 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>  </p><p>In the Eastern Atlantic, it is known from Cabo Verde, off the coast of West Africa, where it was one of the most commonly captured  species on longline surveys in 1982, but by the late 2000s was  infrequently caught (Stobberup 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). The Dusky  Shark could also be expected to be found further along the West African coastline (Ebert <em>et al.</em>  2013). Given the intense coastal shark fisheries in this region there  is concern that this species may have disappeared from this large part  of its Eastern Atlantic distribution. <br/></p><p></p><p>Across the regions, the Dusky Shark was estimated to be steeply  declining in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian Ocean, and declining,  but to a lesser degree, in the Western Indian Ocean. The Northwest Atlantic subpopulation and the Indo-Pacific subpopulation  are estimated to have both undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over three  generation lengths (89.4–114  years). To estimate a global  population trend, the estimated three generation  population trends for  each region were weighted according to the  relative size of each region.  The global estimated median reduction  was 75.8%, with the highest  probability of &gt;80% reduction over three  generation lengths (89.4–114  years). The areas of the three regional  data sets are relatively small  compared to the global distribution, and  abundance trends are unknown in  parts of its distribution. Overall, expert judgement elicitation inferred global population reduction was<strong> </strong>50–79%    over three generations (89.4–114 years) based on slow recovery in the Eastern Indian Ocean, prohibition in the Northwest Atlantic   that is  reducing catches, and actual levels of exploitation that  likely  result  in steep suspected declines where the species is subject to unmanaged  fisheries.  Therefore, the Dusky Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"The Dusky Shark has a cosmopolitan but patchy distribution in tropical and warm temperate seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The meat and fins of the Dusky Shark are highly valued with the meat used fresh, dried salted, frozen, or smoked.

South Africa has imposed a recreational bag limit for Dusky Sharks. </p>  <p>To allow recovery, it is recommended that Dusky Shark retention and landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered (or above).

It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal population reductions of &gt;50% and &gt;80% in the United States and South Africa, respectively over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years), and stock assessments in Australia indicate a reduction of 60% over the past three generation lengths (78 years). It is also suspected to have declined by 50–79% in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years). All of these declines are attributed to fisheries exploitation. There are signs of population recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, South Africa, and Australia. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where species-specific information is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (60–78 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Sandbar Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It occurs in shallow waters associated with bays, estuaries and harbours and offshore on oceanic banks (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Some stocks make extensive seasonal migrations, such as those in the Northwest Atlantic and South Africa (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of ~240 cm total length (TL), possibly to 300 cm TL, with regional variation in size-at-maturity and age parameters; males mature at 123–180 cm TL and females mature at 129–190 cm TL (McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta with variable litter sizes of 1–14 pups (5–12 common), a bienniel to triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally) and size-at-birth of 40–76 cm TL (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 1988, Joung and Chen 1995, Hazin <em>et al</em>. 2007, McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty <em>et al</em>. 2016). Female age-at-maturity ranges from 8 to 16 years and maximum observed age ranges from 21 to 27 years (Casey <em>et al</em>. 1985, Sminkey and Musick 1995, Joung <em>et al</em>. 2004, McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Romine <em>et al</em>. 2006, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hale and Baremore 2013, Romine <em>et al</em>. 2013, Geraghty <em>et al</em>. 2016). In this assessment, age parameters are used from: (1) the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico where female age-at-maturity is 13.1 years and maximum age is 27 years resulting in a generation length of 20 years (Baremore and Hale 2012, Hale and Baremore 2013): and (2) Western Australia where female age-at-maturity is 16.2 years and maximum age is suggested as 36 years for females resulting in a generation length of 26 years (McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2006). The observed maximum age from Western Australia is 25 years, however based on maximum size, maximum age is estimated as 36 years which is likely more realistic based on inference from bomb radiocarbon and oxtetracycline validation (Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2011, Natanson <em>et al</em>. 2019).","<em></em>The Sandbar Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. The species is an important component of target industrial shark fisheries, and is also captured as bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries. It is captured with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl and retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is also captured in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, SEDAR 2017, Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). At-vessel mortality of Sandbar Sharks varies from 3–63% for trawl, and demersal and pelagic longline, with research indicating that on longlines, larger individuals have higher mortality (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Short term post-release mortality of 25% was found for Sandbar Sharks caught on research longlines and released alive and in good condition (Barnes <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged industrial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off southern Brazil, intensive fishing on pupping and nursery grounds is thought to have caused excessively high juvenile mortality (Musick <em>et al</em>. 2009). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years and has been linked with declines in demersal fish stocks in several areas of the region, including Senegal and Guinea, and most notably, in higher-trophic level predators, such as sharks (Gascuel 2007). The Sandbar Shark has been intensively exploited and overfished in both coastal and pelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Mozambique and Tanzania, artisanal fishing pressure has increased dramatically over the past 50 years and is intense with reported declines in sharks due to this increased pressure (Jacquet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Benkenstein 2013, Katikiro <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In Hawaii, the Sandbar Shark is incidentally captured as a minor component (~0.1% of observed catches) of the shark bycatch in the pelagic tuna longline fishery (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The species’ presence in inshore and estuarine waters and its use of coastal nursery areas means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing.","Genetic data indicate likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Portnoy <em>et al</em>. 2010). A molecular study suggested distinct differences between the species in the Indo-Pacific and Western Atlantic, however, a wider geographic range of samples is required (Naylor <em>et al</em>. 2012). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (SEDAR 2017) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the stock assessment from the Atlantic, that is, the United States (US) Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and US Caribbean, estimated that the stock was overfished but not currently experiencing overfishing (SEDAR 2017). The spawning stock fecundity had most likely reduced by 66% from virgin levels (SEDAR 2017). The low biological productivity of the species and vulnerability of non-mature animals to fishing gears suggested a stock that cannot support a high level of exploitation, however, the strict limitation on catches in recent years has halted overfishing (SEDAR 2017). The stock had previously been assessed as subject to overfishing in 2006 which led to a ban on catches and a rebuilding plan (SEDAR 2017). The trend analysis of the spawning stock fecundity for 1960–2015 (56 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.2%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 74.5% over three generation lengths (60 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% population reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) bather protection program (South Africa), fluctuated but steadily declined from 1981 to 2019 (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). A decline in catch rate was also observed between the periods 1966–1972 and 1978–1987 (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 1988). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 88.9% over three generation lengths (78 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (78 years). It is unlikely that the observed decline is due to the KZNSB alone, as catches in the KZNSB are low. Elsewhere in South Africa, this species is not targeted by any commercial or recreational fisheries. It is likely that the declines are influenced by the heavy fishing pressure in the adjacent waters of Mozambique and Tanzania. Over the past 10 years, the CPUE in the KZNSB has been stable and possibly increasing slightly which may be a reflection of the management changes in the bather protection program which has seen a reduction in effort in order to reduce captures of species.<br/><br/>Additionally, stock assessment of the Sandbar Shark in Australia indicated that the stock in Western Australia is now recovering while the stock in east Australia is undefined due to insufficient available information to determine status (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Western Australia, the stock was previously found to be over-exploited with the breeding stock abundance declining. This led to management actions such as effort limits, gear restrictions, and spatial closures. The breeding stock is currently estimated to have declined by 60% from unfished biomass and although this is close to the minimum acceptable limit of decline and indicative of a depleted stock, biomass projections under current fishing and management measures indicate continued stock rebuilding, though this may take several decades (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2018, Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020). Unfished biomass is considered as 70–80 years ago when commercial fishing in Western Australia commenced and thus, the 60% population decline is over the past three generation lengths of the Sandbar Shark (78 years). Further, in northwest Australia, fishery independent surveys for 2003–2017 in an area closed to commercial fishing in 1993 that was expanded in 2005, showed that catch rates increased from 2008 to 2017 suggesting the population is beginning to recover (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, catches of the Sandbar Shark have declined significantly. The species was common along the Levantine coast until the 1980s. Historically, the species was regularly observed in fish markets of southern Sicily and was recorded in most coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea. However, recent records in those markets and areas are sporadic with no observations of pregnant females. It is still recorded occasionally in Algerian waters (F. Hemida pers. comm. 13 April 2021) and in the Gulf of Gabès, Tunisia (Capapé et al. 2019), and the Gulf of Gökova in Turkey which appear to be nursery grounds. The population is suspected to have declined by 50–79% in the Mediterranean Sea over the past three generation lengths (69 years) (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the Sandbar Shark is not a common component of fishery catches. In a survey of shark landings from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, it represented 2% of shark landings by number from Yemen (Bonfil 2003). It comprised less than 1% of total elasmobranch landings by number in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea and in the shark landings of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Spaet and Berumen 2015, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2016). It represented 3% of sharks by number transported from Oman and traded in the UAE (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Sandbar Shark was only recently confirmed from landings in India (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Sri Lanka (De Silva 2006). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches with a population decline of 50–79% suspected for the Sandbar Shark over the past three generation lengths (78 years) (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, the Sandbar Shark was one of the most abundant species in the commercial shark fishery off northeast waters, where it represented 10% of the annual total shark catch in the 1990s. However, the catches have since declined due to high fishing mortality with a substantial decrease in average sizes also noted from 1991 to 2002 (Joung <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Sandbar Shark is estimated and suspected to have declined by 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years) due to fishing pressure. There are signs of recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, Australia, and South Africa. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where information on this species is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (60–78 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Sandbar Shark has a circumglobal distribution (De Silva <em>et al</em>. 2006, White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2015, SEAFDEC 2016, Hylton <em>et al</em>. 2017, White <em>et al</em>. 2017, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2018, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019).","The species is used for its valuable meat and fins and to a lesser extent for its skin and liver oil (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013). The proportion of Sandbar Shark fins in the Hong Kong shark fin trade appears to have declined from 2.4% to 0.2% from 2002 to 2015 (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006, Fields <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species is displayed in public aquaria (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,"Sandbar specific management measures are in place in a few countries. In the United States Atlantic waters, the Sandbar Sharks became a prohibited species in 2008 (outside of the shark research fishery) under the Atlantic Fishery Management Plan for Consolidated Highly Migratory Species. Prohibited species must be released immediately with minimum injury and without removing them from the water (SEDAR 2017). In Australia, the Sandbar Shark is under comprehensive management plans in both Western Australia and New South Wales, the main jurisdictions where it has been caught in recent years (McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2006, the Western Australian Government introduced changes in commercial fisheries to reduce mortality, particularly of Sandbar Shark and Dusky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus obscurus</em>), including a maximum size limit, additional controls on the use of longlines, and extension of spatial closures to protect the adult component of the stocks (McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2005, Molony <em>et al</em>. 2013). In New South Wales, there is a 500 kg weekly trip limit and a 160 t total allowable catch for large shark species, including Sandbar Shark (Broadhurst <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Turkey, Sandbar Shark fisheries are prohibited (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2016). In South Africa, this species may be present in the Aliwal Shoal, St. Lucia, and Maputalands Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) which provide refuge from commercial, but not recreational fishing which is permitted in the MPAs. With regard to the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets, the KZNSB has reduced fishing effort in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific measures. Many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It has been recorded from the continental shelves and <span lang=""EN-GB"">upper slopes at depths of 50–1,500 m, and mostly 300–1,100 m. The Gulper Shark is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and commercial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years). Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, but the species may find some refuge at depth. The species is suspected to have undergone large population reduction and ongoing declines across the Indo-Pacific and West Africa. Globally, the Gulper Shark is estimated to have reduced by 50–79% over the last three generations (~83 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Gulper Shark&#160;is demersal and benthopelagic on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 98–1,500 m (possibly down to 2,307 m), and mostly 300–1,100 m (White <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2013, Weigmann, 2016, C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 176 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~111 cm TL; females at ~143 cm TL (Cotton <em>et al.</em> 2015, Weigmann 2016).

Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). <br/><br/>Gulper sharks&#160;have been historically exploited commercially in the Northeast Atlantic. Most catch is thought to comprise Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>), however, catches of Gulper Shark are thought to have been misidentified with this species. Landings of the Leafscale Gulper Shark were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Portuguese Dogfish,&#160;<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>)&#160;in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, <a style="""">there was an apparent increase in reported landings</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches of deep-water sharks <a>are difficult to </a>determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper Sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and during the period 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has occurred off the Andaman Islands&#160;since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Gillnet catches of the Gulper Shark peaked at 128 t in 2013 and declined to 30 t in 2015; an additional 102 t of the species was taken in the same year using longline gear (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Gulper Shark to have high to extreme vulnerability across all fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;</p>","<p>Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of Gulper Sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp). Species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the&#160;Gulf of Mexico (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths (83.4 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of decrease of 10.1%, with the highest probability of&#160;&gt;80% reductions in population over the three generation lengths (83.4 years). <br/><br/><a>Nearly&#160;</a>all landings of Gulper Sharks, other than the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>), from the Northeast Atlantic have been reported from the Portuguese longline fishery (ICES-WGEF 2018). Annual landings were ~100 t until 2008, and rapidly declined to 2 t in 2009, likely in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings <a style="""">from&#160;</a>distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Gulper Shark, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations. Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). <br/><br/>Off the Maldives, the gulper shark stock collapsed in the early 2000s due to targeted fishing, after only about 20 years of exploitation. Although time-series data are not available for catches or landings, there is data for shark liver oil exports. These show a peak in 1982 soon after the fishery commenced followed by a general downwards trend until 1989, increases in 1990 and 1991, before a complete crash sometime thereafter as available data shows very low export figures for 1996 onward (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007, Ali 2015). The fishery has ceased and since 2010 there has been no shark fishing in the Maldives. <br/><br/>The gulper shark stock off India is suspected to have similarly collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing off western India. Gulper shark&#160;landings declined from 114 t in 2008 to 39 t in 2011 (K.K. Bineesh, unpubl. data 2019), equating to a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generations (~83 years). Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of gulper sharks&#160;declined from 18% to 1–14% between 1984–2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). In Sri Lanka, the targeted gulper shark fishery at Valaichchenai, which dates back to the 1980s, has seen a large reduction in effort, from 30 to 2 vessels, in recent years (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). The rationale for this reduction in fleet is claimed to be self-regulation of the fishery, although lack of long-term economic and biological viability of the fishery is also suspected.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, data from a targeted bottom longline fishing for gulper sharks&#160;landed in the Tenau, East Nusa Tenggara, documented a decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 145 kg/trip to 78 kg/trip between 2011–2014; the Gulper Shark was found to account for 15–20% of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp catch (Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Total catch of dogfishes, a mixed category for more than 10 species, reported to the Indonesian&#160;National Shark Data Collection program&#160;decreased from&#160;16,536 t in 2005 to 4,820 t in 2016&#160;(DGCF, 2017).

Commercial captures of the Gulper Shark in Japan is unknown. In Suruga Bay, Japan, research surveys using drop line and demersal longline reported 355&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp across 125 hauls and 55 000 hooks, with the highest CPUE occurring in waters &gt;1,000 m (Yano and Kugai 1993). In 2003, a demersal trawl survey reported a CPUE of 1–6 individuals per tow caught between 500–1,000 m (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2007). These surveys have used different methods and are thus not comparable, but could indicate the species is found at low density in the region, or is found at depths beyond most fishing effort.<br/><br/>The Gulper Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range.&#160;<a>Area</a>-weighted trend analysis for related species <em>Centrophorus squamosus</em> indicated a 46.7% median population reduction with the highest probability of 59% reduction (see assessment for <em>C. squamosus</em>).&#160;Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations (~83 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and  small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is generally retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep population declines have occurred in the north and south Atlantic, with declines also evident, though not as steep in the north Pacific and Indian Oceans.

Males mature at 166–204 cm TL and females at 265–312 cm TL (Pratt and Casey 1983,  Stevens 1983, Cliff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1990, Francis and Duffy 2005, Varghese <em>et al. </em>2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an estimated gestation period of 15–18  months and a three-year reproductive cycle (Mollet and Cailliet 2002). Litter size is 4–25 pups (possibly up to 30, mostly 10–18) with a size at birth of 60–70 cm TL (Garrick 1967, Compagno 2001). Female age at maturity varies from 18–21 years and maximum age from 28–32 years in New Zealand, the Southwest Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Northwest Atlantic Oceans; generation length is therefore 24–25 years (Bishop<em> et al. </em>2006, Natanson <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2013, Doño <em>et al. </em>2014, Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<p><br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>The Shortfin Mako is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The majority of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2017), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015, Campana <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality, although such mortality is reported at 10% for recreational fishing (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, French<em> et al. </em>2015). Commercial post-release mortality has  been reported as 30–33% for the Shortfin Mako on longlines (Campana <em>et al. </em>2016b). The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>  </p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Shortfin Mako. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins (Schrey and Heist 2003, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) stock assessments in the north Atlantic and south Atlantic (ICCAT 2017); (2) stock assessment in the north Pacific (ISC 2018); (3) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the south Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014); and (4) a preliminary stock assessment in the Indian Ocean (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, while the previous north Atlantic stock assessment suggested low probability of overfishing and that stocks were healthy (ICCAT 2012), the most recent north Atlantic stock assessment revealed that the stock was both overfished and that overfishing was occurring (ICCAT 2017). The south Atlantic stock assessment biomass estimates were deemed unreliable by the stock assessors, although they inferred that fishing mortality is likely unsustainable (ICCAT 2017). This concern is corroborated by a recent analysis of standardized catch rates of Shortfin Mako on longlines in the south Atlantic that revealed steep declines of 99% in the average CPUE of 1979–1997 and 1998–2007 (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016a). As a result of the unreliable stock assessment, the north Atlantic stock assessment was considered as representative of the south Atlantic for the trend analysis. The trend analysis of the north Atlantic modelled biomass for 1950–2017 (68 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated median decline of 60.0% over three generation lengths (75 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the north Pacific stock assessment revealed that the stock was likely not overfished and that overfishing was likely not occurring (ISC 2018). The trend analysis of the modelled spawning abundance for 1975–2016 (42 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.6%, consistent with a median decline of 36.5% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths. Although the stock assessment used a long data time series of 40 years, the trend analysis considered the population change over a longer period of 72 years, which results in a greater decline than that of the stock assessment.<br/><br/>Third, the New Zealand longline observer Shortfin Mako standardized CPUE for 1995–2013 (19 years) (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014) was used to represent the catches in that region as it is observer data with good coverage, comes from the part of the region with highest catch rates, and Shortfin Mako move between New Zealand waters and areas further north. The trend analysis indicated annual rates of increase of 0.5%, consistent with a median increase of 35.2% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the Indian Ocean preliminary stock assessment indicated that the Shortfin Mako stock is not currently overfished but subject to overfishing, however the biomass trajectories trend towards overfished with overfishing status (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1971–2015 (45 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.9%, consistent with a median decline of 47.9% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Shortfin Mako and Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.12 (time range 135 years) and biomass of -0.15 (time range 106 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferreti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Shortfin Mako was estimated to be declining in all oceans, other than the south Pacific where it is increasing. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 46.6%, with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (72–75 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Endangered A2.",Decreasing,The Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrnchus</em>) is widespread in temperate and  tropical waters of all oceans (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).,"<p></p><p>This is one of the most valuable shark species due to its high-quality meat. The meat is utilized fresh, frozen, smoked, and dried-salted for human consumption. The fins of the Shortfin Mako are commonly traded, comprising 1.2% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields <em>et al. </em>2017). The liver oil, jaws, and skin are also used (Compagno 2001).</p>",Marine,"<p>  </p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. In 2008, the Shortfin Mako was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation. In 2018, Mexico announced its intention to propose adding the Shortfin Mako to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). If the proposal is adopted at the 2019 CITES Conference, Shortfin Mako exports from CITES Parties would need to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>Globally, there are very few limits on Shortfin Mako catch. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Shortfin Mako and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Whereas the European Union implemented this measure through domestic regulations, it has yet to limit Shortfin Mako catch from anywhere else, even as Spain is consistently the world’s top Shortfin Mako fishing nation. A 2017 measure agreed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;–&#160;in response to scientific advice to ban retention of overfished north Atlantic Shortfin Makos&#160;–&#160;instead aims to maximize live release by narrowing the conditions under which Shortfin Makos from this population can be landed.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended Shortfin Mako landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on Shortfin Mako catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, and promotion of safe release protocols are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global

The Bramble Shark is retained for its liver oil, which is considered one of the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities.

The species is infrequently reported across most of its range. In European waters, the species is now very rarely reported (e.g. Kabasakal and Bilecenoglu 2014) after centuries of exploitation (Iglésias&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018); any captures of the species would impede regional population recovery.<br/><br/>The Bramble Shark is a major component of the bycatch of intensive fisheries operating off southwest India (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, 2013). Fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. In 1999, a deep-water shrimp trawl fishery developed and expanded rapidly; trawler numbers peaked the following year (2000–2001) before declining significantly, although there are still some 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;A targeted gulper shark liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and between 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting gulper shark fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019), and the species may also been previously reported from the gulper shark fishery operating off the Maldives (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). This fishery collapsed and closed after &lt;20 years of operation (Ali 2015). Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Bramble Shark to have high vulnerability to demersal trawl in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water fishing off the Atlantic coast of Brazil was initiated in 1973 as a handline fishery for Atlantic Wreckfish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>) on the upper slope (Perez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). However, industrial deep-water fisheries did not emerge until the early 2000s at which point unprecedented industrial exploration began on fishing grounds 200–1,000 m deep (Perez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Pio&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Development of four main fisheries (hook and line, benthic gillnet, pot, and benthic trawl) was intense; the entire area fished for deep-water shrimp species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three-year period (2003–2006) (Dallagnolo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil, the Bramble Shark was potential bycatch in a bottom gillnet fishery operating on the upper slope (200–500 m depth). This fishery operates across the entire known depth range of the species from this region (200–250 m), and a deep-water gill net monitoring program for monkfish off Brazil reported 4,378 Bramble Sharks were captured in 2001 (Rincon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The species has otherwise been infrequently reported in low numbers from demersal trawl and longline fisheries (Rincon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>Records of the species around Africa are scarce, with most historic records reported from depths &lt;100 m (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 1991). The Bramble Shark was reported to be commonly caught by handline off Senegal in the 1960s (Cadenat and Blache 1981).&#160;In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004).&#160;Between 1950–1998, there was an increase in, or appearance of, reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). A number of targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;</p>","<p>Population size and trends for this species across its entire range are unknown. It is infrequently reported across much of its range.<br/><br/>The Bramble Shark has been exploited throughout European waters since the 1700s (Iglésias&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Historic records indicate the species was relatively common until the 19th century; reports of the species rose sharply in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s and collapsed in the early 20th century, strongly corresponding with advancements in steamships and growth of regional fishing performance (Iglésias<em>&#160;et al. </em>2018). The species is thought to be locally extinct from many European countries.<br/><br/>The Bramble Shark is a major component of the bycatch of fisheries operating off southwest India (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, 2013) and the population here is suspected to have collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing. Bramble Shark landings from Kerala have declined from 132 t in 2008 to 2.6 t in 2018 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). These data were analysed over three generation lengths (48 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of decrease of 32.6% consistent with an estimated decrease of&#160;100% over three generation lengths, with the highest probability of&#160; &gt;80% reductions in population over the three generation lengths.<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery declined steadily from 158 t in 1984 to 37 t in 2001, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations. Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely overexploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe overexploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Research trawl surveys in southern Brazil have indicated declines of 50% or more in landings of some sharks and rays between 1980 and 2005 (Ferreira<strong>&#160;</strong><em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). The current status of the species off Brazil is unknown. <br/><br/>The Bramble Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range. Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).&#160;</p>","Where population trend data were available, data were analyzed over three generation lengths (62 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>In Japan, catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data is available for this species from Suruga Bay (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The CPUE (number of sharks/trawl) of the&#160;Shortspine&#160;Spurdog from 2007 to 2018 showed an increasing trend over time. The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 19.4%, consistent with an estimated increase of over three generation lengths (62 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the past three generation lengths.<br/><br/>In China, there is no species-specific time series, although reconstructed catches based on landings data are available for all sharks, rays, and skates. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/09/2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara<em> et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>When declines from China and South Korea are scaled to three generation lengths (62 years), they represent declines of &gt;95% in both regions. While these levels of declines are not species-specific, they are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Across the regions, the Shortspine Spurdog is suspected to be declining in China and Korea and estimated to be increasing in Japan.&#160;Most of the distribution of this species is in China and South Korea where historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high.&#160;In Japan, species-specific catch rates indicate an increasing population over the past decade and fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort is decreasing and continuing to decline.

In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Despite some area closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016, Santana <em>et al. </em>2020).

Smalleye Smoothhound inhabits mud, sand, and shell debris on the continental shelves and upper slopes from close inshore to 130 m depth. It reaches a maximum size of 64 cm total length (TL); males mature at 43 cm TL and females mature at 48 cm TL. Reproduction is yolk-sac placenta viviparous with a litter size of 1–7 pups&#160; (usually 3–5) and size-at-birth of 21–24 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013). Generation length is suspected to be similar to the Dusky Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus canis</em>), which <span lang=""en-AU"">reaches maturity at 5.5 years of age and has a  longevity of 16 years, and therefore has an estimated generation length  of 10.8 years (Conrath <em>et al.</em> 2002), although this may be an overestimate because of that species larger size. <span lang=""en-AU""><br/><br/><br/><span lang=""en-AU""><span lang=""en-AU""><span lang=""en-AU""></span></span>","The Smalleye Smoothhound is captured in commercial demersal trawl fisheries and in commercial and artisanal driftnets, gillnets and longlines.<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> Artisanal fisheries  are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are  largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many  areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack  management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which  stocks have collapsed  (P. Me<span class=""st"">j<span class=""st"">ía-Falla   and A. Navia unpubl.  data 2018), but at the present time it is  unclear how  much, if any, fishing  effort is still occurring in this  fishery<span class=""st"">. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal  fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in  catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing  (Mendoza 2015). This shark is targeted with gillnets and longlines there  on offshore islands including the Los Roques Archipelago, where<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> there were already reported declines in abundance in the 1990s, and Margarita  Island, where this species makes up about 40% of the shark catch by number <span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">(Tavares 2005, Tavares <em>et al. </em>2010, Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2015). Further, it is also the most captured elasmobranch in artisanal fisheries off the mainland state of Sucre (Marquez <em>et al. </em>2019). In Trinidad, this shark is the fourth most-captured elasmobranch (N. Simpson pers. comm. 28/11/ 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). In Guyana, this species is caught in relatively high numbers in the commercial trawl fishery targeting Atlantic Seabob (<em>Xiphopenaeus kroyeri</em>), which does have management measures in place but bycatch mitigation for elasmobranchs has not been implemented to date (Garstin and Oxenford 2018). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011).

Faria unpubl. data 2018). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing at depths of 20 to 1000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016).  Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted  by artisanal fishers are over-exploited, half of those being collapsed  (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;<span

In Venezuela, this species is targeted in intensive fisheries,  and there were already reported declines in abundance around Los Roques  Archipelago in the 1990s (Tavares 2005). Landings for <em>Mustelus </em>spp. in  Venezuela rose through the 1990s and reached a peak in 2004, after which  they declined quickly, likely an indication of overfishing (Tavares <em>et al.</em>  2010). Venezuelan landings of this species have been variable over the past ten years, but have declined by about 30% over the four years from 2014 to 2018 despite maintained fishing effort (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2018). The situation is expected to be similar in the Guianas, but there are no data. In the northwestern Brazilian states of Amap<span class=""st"">á and Par<span class=""st"">á, this species has been caught in high numbers as demersal trawl bycatch since the 1980s (V. Faria unpubl. data 2018), and a population reduction of 50% or more is suspected. There are no data from further south in this species' range, but it is exposed to artisanal and industrial demersal trawl fisheries that have shown signs of inadequate management. Due to the level of exploitation by  widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries,  which lack adequate management, combined with observed declines in  Venezuela, it is suspected that the Smalleye Smoothhound has undergone a population  reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (33 years).</span>",Decreasing,"The Smalleye Smoothhound occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from Colombia to southern Brazil (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019). Records of this species from north of Colombia in the Western Central Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico are considered to be misidentifications of other smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus </em>spp.) (Castro <em>et al. </em>2011, Del Moral-Flores <em>et al.</em> 2015, C. Avalos, M.P. Blanco-Parra, A. Briones, E. Espinoza, B. Naranjo and J. Morales unpubl. data 2019).","Houndsharks in general are fished and valued for their meat, liver oil, and fins (Ebert <em>et al.</em>  2013), and this species is likely to be used similarly where it is  fished. The meat is likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold  locally in most places, however Brazil does import shark meat under the  general name <em>cação</em>, which is in high demand (Bornatowski <em>et al.</em> 2015, Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for the Smalleye Smoothhound. To conserve the population and permit recovery, fisheries management measures such as species protection, spatial and/or seasoanl closures, and bycatch mitigation are needed, all of which require resources for effective implementation and enforcement. Further  research is needed on distribution, population size and trends, and  threats. Commercial and artisanal fisheries should be monitored at the  species level.  <p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
3093780,60217,Carcharhinus perezi,Endangered,A2bcd,2021,2019-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Caribbean Reef Shark<em> </em>(<em>Carcharhinus perezi</em>) is a medium-sized (to 295 cm TL) reef-dwelling shark found throughout the Western Central Atlantic from the North Carolina (United States of America) the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea to Brazil. It occurs mainly on coral reefs on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 378 m.<br/><br/>This inshore shark has low productivity due to a biennial reproductive cycle with a one-year-long gestation and relatively small litters of 3–6 pups. It is taken as target species and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries throughout its range. In areas where it is not protected, there have been population reductions of 99% over the past three generation lengths (29 years) based on Baited Remote Underwater Videos Stations (BRUVS). However, in areas where protection measures are in place such as “shark sanctuaries” (e.g. Bahamas), the population has remained relatively stable since the 1980s. A comparison of the number of sharks per reef throughout the Caribbean Sea based on BRUVS data also suggest abundance is six times higher in areas where protections are in place.<br/><br/>A preliminary estimate indicates that 20% of the Caribbean is designated as “shark sanctuary” where commercial shark fishing is prohibited providing some protection for Caribbean Reef Shark. The reef area weighted population depletion level for Caribbean Reef Shark estimates a population reduction of 52.5% (standard error 40.4–64.5%) assuming that this depletion occurred over the past three generation lengths (29 years). The range in estimated population reduction includes both the Vulnerable and Endangered Red List categories, but most of the range is within the Endangered category. Due to the relatively high level of inadequately-managed fishing pressure, its relatively unproductive life history, the lack of enforcement in established protected areas, and a continuing decline in habitat quality, it is estimated that the Caribbean Reef Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (29 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.&#160;</p>","The Caribbean Reef Shark is a tropical inshore shark inhabiting coral reefs on continental and insular shelves across a wide depth range from the surface to a depth of 378 m (Chapman <em>et al</em>. 2007, Castro 2011, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 295 cm total length (TL), males mature at 150–170 cm TL and females mature at 180–190 cm TL (Pikitch <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Tavares 2009). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 3–6, an approximately one year gestation and biennial reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 70 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Generation&#160;length was estimated as 9.6 years based on an age-at-maturity of 4.2 years estimated from the reported length-at-maturity and back-transforming length into age using the growth curve and maximum age of 15 year&#160;(Tavares 2009).","The Caribbean Reef Shark is targeted and/or captured as bycatch in artisanal and commercial gillnets and longlines throughout its range. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial longline fisheries in several areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and this shark is frequently captured in the demersal longline fishery, particularly off San Andrés Archipelago (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This shark is captured in large numbers there off the Los Roques Archipelago, including juveniles and neonates (Tavares 2009). Artisanal fisheries are likely to capture this species across the Guianas, but there are no data. In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos<em> et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>),&#160; Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and the congeneric Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Santana <em>et al</em>. 2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are over-exploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to fisheries pressure, coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean Sea, which are the primary habitat for this species,  are in decline due to climate change, specifically coral bleaching, disease, invasive species, and coastal  pollution (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Overall, this shark has very little refuge from fishing, and is at threat from a continuing decline in habitat quality.","Genetic information shows residency and/or site-fidelity to specific locations by individual Caribbean Reef Sharks. However, similar to other reef shark studies, the level of genetic connectivity among populations is context-dependent, with sharks occupying isolated habitats showing greater genetic differentiation compared with those sharks occupying semi-isolated or continuous reef habitats. Furthermore, Caribbean Reef Sharks have low genetic diversity and a shallow mitochondrial population history suggesting historical demographic fluctuations (Bernard <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In Belize, this species appears to have initially had a stable population up to 2013 based on longline catches (Bond&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Trend data from Belize and the Bahamas was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2020, Winker <em>et al.</em>  2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change  over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely  IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (29  years) (see <strong>Supplementary Information 1</strong>). The Belize relative abundance time-series based on baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVs) from 2009 to 2018  (G. Clementi and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019) indicated that annual abundance declined by 15.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.2% over the past three generation lengths (29 years). Longline catch data from the Bahamas from 1979–1984<span class=""st""> and 2011–2013 <span class=""st""><span class=""st"">(Talwar <em>et al.</em> 2020) suggest that the population has been relatively stable, increasing annually by 0.8% over the past three generation lengths (29 years)&#160;(<span class=""st""><strong>Supplementary Information 1</strong>). The Bahamas data is two short time-series with a 30-year gap and should be interpreted with caution; the stability and slow increase may be due to an actual population increase but may also reflect a habitat shift from areas of higher human activity to the sampled area that has less human activity (Talwar <em>et al. </em>2020). Population of the Caribbean Reef Shark have remained relatively stable since the 1980s in areas where the commercial exploitation of sharks is prohibited dubbed “shark sanctuaries” (e.g. Bahamas). A comparison of the number of sharks per reef throughout the Caribbean Sea based on BRUVs data also suggest abundance is six times higher in areas where protections are in place (D. Cardenosa and D. Chapman unpubl. data 2019). A preliminary estimate indicates that 20% of the Caribbean Sea is designated as “shark sanctuary” or provides other similar safeguards for Caribbean Reef Shark.<br/><br/>In Caribbean Colombia, this species is common and increasing, but may have undergone some past reductions due to illegal fishing and was thus assessed as Near Threatened nationally (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Venezuela, there are no data, but this species is caught in high numbers (Tavares 2009), and it is suspected that with a lack of management this has led to declines there. There are also no data from the Guianas, but artisanal fisheries there remain unmanaged and may be a cause for concern for this species. In Brazil, this species is listed as Vulnerable due to the level of exploitation there and notable declines in landings in the State of Maranhão and the Trindade and Martin Vaz archipelago, with a suspected reduction in population size of 30% (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2019). In fact, this species is suspected to have been lost from coastal Brazil and is now likely only found off four islands (Paracel, Noronhua, Abrolhos, Trindade), as the last confirmed record was from Cearà State in 1987 (F.M. Santana pers. comm. 25/04/2018). It was formerly common in places such as São Paulo (Sadovsky 1967).<br/><br/>A total of 4,834 BRUVS deployments at 109 reefs in 18 jurisdictions (of 15 nations) were used in the analysis of depletion and Red List status of Caribbean Reef Shark. In total, Finprint sampled jurisdictions that covered 88.2% of the world’s coral reefs (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Caribbean Reef Shark depletion estimates were based on jurisdictions that contained 73.6% of the coral reefs within its known range. Depletion was estimated to be greatest in locations such as Jamaica, Dominican Republic, mainland Colombia and the Islands (<strong>Supplementary Information 2</strong>). On coral reefs across the Caribbean, the reef area weighted population depletion level for Caribbean Reef Shark was 52.5% (standard error 40.4–64.5%) (see <strong>Supplementary Information 2</strong>). Assuming that this depletion occurred over the past three generation lengths (29 years), this equated to an estimated population reduction of 52.5% (standard error 40.4–64.5%) meeting Endangered A2b. Error estimates include both the Vulnerable and Endangered Red List categories, but given the majority of the range is within the Endangered category, and the estimate is likely to be an underestimate of the reduction, and due to levels of exploitation, we conclude that the most suitable category for Caribbean Reef Shark is Endangered A2bcd.<strong><br/></strong></span></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Caribbean Reef Shark occurs throughout the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from the North Carolina (United States of America), the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea to Brazil (Castro 2011, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The Caribbean Reef Shark is used for meat, fins, leather (skin), oil (livers) and fishmeal (from carcasses). In Colombia, the jaws and livers are used for ornaments and oil, respectively, while the meat is only occasionally used as it is not easily marketed. Based on trimmings of shark fins from Guangzhou and Hong Kong, Caribbean Reef Shark were not reported as part of the fin trade (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2020). SCUBA diving with these sharks has become a very popular form of ecotourism. For example, in 2007, divers experienced an estimated 73,000 shark interactions in the Bahamas, generating roughly US $78 million in annual revenue (Cline 2008), and Haas <em>et al.</em> (2017) estimated a contribution of US $113 million to the Bahamian economy per year through shark and ray-related tourism. In over 20 years, the Bahamas have offered over 1 million shark-diver interactions, contributing an estimated gross of US $800 million to the Bahamian economy (Cline 2008).",Marine,"In July 2006, the United States National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Caribbean Reef Sharks are listed as a prohibited species to commercial and recreational harvest under this management plan. <br/><br/>In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in 1993, and peak  elasmobranch export occurred the same year. The export steadily  declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The  Bahamas occurred in 2004. The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was  established in 2011 (Haas<em> et al</em>. 2017), and it is currently illegal to  fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts there. Enforcement is very  underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploitation may be  occurring at present or in the future.<br/><br/>Cuba has designated 21% of the country as a Marine Protected Area. There  is no fishing for sharks or rays in these areas. The most important  Marine Protected Area is Jardines de la Reina, Alejandro de Humbolt,  Guanacabibes. Shark fishing is illegal in Jardines de la Reina Marine Reserve  and local guides have noted an increase in sightings of many species of  reef-associated sharks including this species since 1997 when the reserve  was declared and enforcement of fishing regulations began.  Cuba also has two places designated for diving with  sharks, Santa Lucia and Jardines de la Reina. Cuba has a prohibition on  finning and in 2015 adopted a National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA – Sharks). <br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15–June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that finning be prohibited. It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a marine protected area of 30 km from the Rio Bravo´s mouth to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.<br/>In the wider Caribbean, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the System of  Integration (SICA), prohibits shark finning with the resolution  OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries from Belize to  Panama, including the Dominican Republic.<br/><br/>In Belize, there are currently no conservation measures protecting sharks  throughout territorial waters. Despite no-take restrictions in  marine reserves, illegal fishing continues to take place and reef sharks  are known to be caught. As such, increased enforcement is required in  Belize's 13 marine reserves to specifically protect shark species  against illegal fishing. Most sharks caught as bycatch in the hook and  line fisheries could be released live but are usually landed.<br/><br/><strong></strong>In Guatemala, there is a fishing ban for one month (usually August) for the capture of sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.<br/><br/>In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Decree 107-2011) that  declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing  and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial  waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation  (Governmental Decree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are  incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>Currently, there are some marine protected areas in the middle and west of the Caribbean coast of Panama (e.g. Portobelo National Park, Bastimentos Island National Marine Park). These protected areas provide a certain level of ecosystem management through implementing control over local fisheries and providing protection for critical habitats (e.g. coral reefs, mangrove), both of these measures can benefit shark populations. Despite the creation of these marine parks, enforcement of protective initiatives in these areas is a challenge. In addition to the creation of marine protected areas, Panama has established nationwide conservation and management policies for the fisheries industry. In 2006, an official regulation was approved that prohibits shark finning in Panama waters. In 2017, new regulations were implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of the number of hooks to 1,000 per surface longline strand), which will help to further contribute to the conservation and management of sharks in Panama.<br/><br/>The archipelago of San Andrés y Providencia, Colombia, was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000, and covers an area of 180,000 km<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 10% of the total area of the Caribbean Sea) and comprises some of the most productive and biodiverse reefs in the region. Since 2008, all shark species have been fully protected in the Seaﬂower Biosphere Reserve, banning ﬁshing and possession of all sharks and their byproducts. These has led to one of the highest shark abundances found in the Caribbean Sea. Local communities pushed for these shark conservation measures in the Archipelago, simplifying the enforcement by local authorities. Enforcement in remote regions against poaching has been challenging, although the Colombian Navy has been leading the enforcement of these areas and has enabled scientific data collection. In addition, Colombia has banned wire-leaders in their longlining ﬁsheries as a bycatch-reduction measure across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where industrial ﬁsheries are only allowed to have a total shark by catch of 35% in a single ﬁshing trip. Finning is prohibited within the Colombia EEZ and ﬁns are required to be attached naturally to the body at the point of landing.<br/><br/>Antilles, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago  developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft  form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will.  For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been  implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created  in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean  Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified  the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks  (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in the South American portion of its range. In Brazil, there has been a finning ban in place since 1998 and a National Plan of Action (NPOA) for sharks and rays was implemented in 2014.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is pelagic and semi-oceanic and inhabits outer continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 600 m, although it is typically found at depths of 26–365 m.<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic, Night Shark make up a significant proportion of the shark bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off the southeast United States and there has been a steady decline in catch-per-unit-effort since 1996, which suggests the population is declining despite a prohibition on commercial harvest in 1999. This decline equates to an estimated population reduction of 50–79% over three generation lengths (50 years).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, this species is very rare and is only known from a few specimens in Caribbean Colombia. In Venezuela, there are no data but the intense and unmanaged longlining and gillnetting occurring off offshore islands which is suspected to be leading to declines there. In Brazil, there are no time-series specific to this species, but the reported landings of ‘Machote’, which includes the species and the Silky Shark (<em>Carcharhinus falciformis</em>), declined by 77% between 2001–2009 and the government subsequently assessed Night Shark as regionally Vulnerable. In the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) due to actual fishing levels.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, Night Shark was documented there in the 1960s, however, there is little historic information to determine whether the species was always rare or has actually since declined. Night Shark has not been recorded recently and has not been recently captured by the Portuguese longline fishery. Given the high degree of industrial and artisanal fishing effort in this region, it is likely the species has declined by an equivalent amount to that in the west Atlantic.<br/><br/>Overall, based on the combination of high fishing mortality throughout its range, estimated population reduction in the US pelagic longline fishery and suspected declines elsewhere, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Night Shark is pelagic and semi-oceanic on the outer continental shelf to a depth of 600 m but mostly, specimens have been collected from 26–365 m (Carlson <em>et al. </em>2008, Castro 2011). It reaches a maximum size of 276 cm total length (TL), males mature at 185–190 cm TL and females mature at 200–205 cm TL (Hazin <em>et al.</em> 2000).

However, since 2003 they are rare in commercial landings in the United States. Although the species is prohibited from commercial and recreational landings, Beerkircher <em>et al.</em> (2004) reported an at-vessel mortality rate of 76% in the pelagic longline fishery. <br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial fisheries in many areas.

Artisanal fisheries are among the major livelihoods in the Guianas and are intense and unmanaged, but there are no data. In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""> (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that target stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, and 58% of target stocks are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). The Night shark has also been captured off Brazil by local and international longline fleets since the 1950s (Bornatowski <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the eastern Atlantic, there are few records of the species captured from fisheries off West Africa.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","<span

by a minimum of 4,150 km (Domingues <em>et al.</em> 2019). While Night Shark mitochondrial DNA samples from Belize were distinct from those in Brazil, sample sizes were too low (n = 14) for robust analyses and Belize samples contained both northern and southern Atlantic lineages (Domingues <em>et al. </em>2019). Population trend data are available from data collected by at-sea observers within the United States (US) pelagic longline fishery (Beerkircher <em>et al. </em>2002). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2020, Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the attached Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic, Night Shark make up a significant proportion of the shark bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery and the data from the US pelagic longline fishery spanning from Canada to the Caribbean Sea suggests either steep declines (Critically Endangered) or increases in abundance (Least Concern) depending on the inclusion of the first years of data. The at-sea observers reported very few Night Sharks in the first four years (1992–1995) of the data series, but many more between 1996 and 2000 (Beerkircher <em>et al.</em> 2002). It seems likely that more Night Shark were caught during 1992–1995 but were reported mostly as “unidentified sharks” or were misidentified as other species in the genus <em>Carcharhinus</em> (Beerkircher<em> et al. </em>2002). However, starting the analysis in 1996 still suggests a steady decline in Night Shark abundance (9.4% from 1996 to 2017), which suggests the species is declining despite being prohibited from commercial harvest. The trend analysis of the same time series for 1995–2018 (24 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.4%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 79.1% over three generation lengths (50 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.&#160;However, due to protections in some core areas of its range (e.g. Bahamas Shark Sanctuary, Colombia Sea Flower Biosphere Reserve, East Florida Coast Closed Area), the uncertainty in some catch data, and reported increases in other studies for parts of its range (i.e. Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, Cortes <em>et al.</em> 2006), expert judgement elicitation using the JARA output as a reference inferred a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).<br/><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span

there are no population trend estimates for this species. In Caribbean Colombia, this species is very rare and is only known from a few specimens (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019). In Venezuela, there are no data but the intense and unmanaged longlining and gillnetting that is occurring off offshore islands is suspected to be leading to reductions in the population (D. Cardenosa unpubl. data 2019). In Brazil, there are no time-series specific to this species, reported landings of ‘Machote’, which includes the species and the Silky Shark (), declined by 77% between 2001–2009 and the government subsequently assessed them as regionally Vulnerable due to a suspected reduction in population size of &gt;30% (Brazil Ministry of the Environment 2016). According to the study of demography of the species in Brazil (Santana  2009), the population of Night Shark has an annual decline of 8.1%, with a generation time of 12.1 years. Taking into account the data from this study, in three generations (36 years), the population decline would be 94.7%. Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, noted declines in some areas, and its low productivity and thus lack of ability to withstand fishing pressure, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) in the Southwest Atlantic part of its range.<span class=""st""></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span><span

are few records of the species captured from fisheries off West Africa. Historical records in the Portuguese longline fishery are lacking, however Night sharks are not currently captured by the fishery (R. Coelho pers. comm. 20/08/2020). Across the eastern Atlantic, the species is rarely captured, although it has been documented as occurring there. However, there is little historic information to suggest if the species has actually declined or was always rare in abundance. Given the fishing effort in this region, it is likely the species has declined at least equivalent to that in the Northwest Atlantic, and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years). </span><br/><br/><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span><span class=""st""><span class=""st""></span><span class=""st""><span

Night Shark generally occurs in outer continental shelf waters in the Northwest, Western Central, and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from Delaware, USA to Río Negro, Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, Bahamas and Caribbean (Castro 2011,  Espinoza <em>et al. </em>2018, Meíja-Falla and Navia 2019, Ehemann <em>et al. </em>2019). This shark also occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Senegal to Namibia, although it may be rare (Castro 2011, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Holotypes are available from specimens collected in Senegal, Gabon, Ghana, and Ivory Coast (B. Seret pers. comm. 6/08/2020).","The Night Shark is caught in primarily pelagic longline fisheries and when retained is used for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin (Carlson<em> et al. </em>2008). Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong and Guangzhou in 2014–2015 and 2015–2017, respectively, Night Shark were not found in the fin trade (Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018, Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2020).",Marine,"In July 2006, the United States (US) National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Night Shark are listed as a prohibited species since 1999 to commercial and recreational harvest under this management plan. In addition, closed areas to US pelagic fishing overlap with areas of abundance for Night Shark (Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2008). <br/><br/>In the Central America and Dominic Republic, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the Sistem of Integration of Central America, prohibit Shark Finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries (from Belize to Panama), including the Dominican Republic.<br/><br/>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15 to June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that finning prohibited and the protection of some species (Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>), White Shark (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>), Basking Shark (<em>Cetorhinus maximus</em>), sawfishes (Pristidae), and species of <em>Mobula</em>). It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of river mouths and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a marine protected area of 30 km from the Rio Bravo mouth to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Marine Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. However, there are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>There is a national regulation (Governmental Degree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Degree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.<br/><br/>In the Guatemalan Caribbean, there is a fishing ban for one month (usually August) for the capture of sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.<br/><br/>There are some marine protected areas in the middle and west of Panama, which may benefit coastal shark populations because it establishes management in these areas like fishery controlled areas. However, enforcement is a challenge. In 2006, a regulation was approved that prohibited shark finning in Panama water. In 2017, another regulation was implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of number of hooks up to 1,000 per surface longline strand).<br/><br/>The archipelago of San Andrés y Providencia, Colombia, was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2000, it covers an area of 180,000 km<sup>2</sup> (i.e., 10% of the total area of the Caribbean Sea) and comprises some of the most productive and biodiverse reefs in the region. Since 2008, all shark species have been fully protected in the Seaﬂower Biosphere Reserve, banning ﬁshing and possession of all sharks and their by-products. These have led to one of the highest shark abundances found in the Caribbean Sea. Local communities pushed for these shark conservation measures in the Archipelago, simplifying the enforcement by local authorities. Enforcement in remote regions against poaching has been challenging, although the Colombian Navy has been leading the enforcement of these areas and has enabled scientiﬁc data collection. In addition, Colombia has banned wire leaders on their longlining ﬁsheries as a bycatch- reduction measure across the entire Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), where industrial ﬁsheries are only allowed to have a total shark by catch of 35% in a single ﬁshing trip. Finning is prohibited within the Colombia EEZ and ﬁns are required to be attached naturally to the body at the moment of landing.<br/><br/>Longline fishing was banned in The Bahamas in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year (UN FAO). The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004 (UN FAO). The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas <em>et al.</em> 2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts in The Bahamas. This protection does not extend to rays or skates. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploitation on may be occurring at present or in the future.<br/><br/>Cuba has designated 21% of the country as a Marine Protect Area. There is no fishing for sharks or rays in these areas. The most important Marine Protect Area is Jardines de la Reina, Alejandro de Humbolt, Guanacabibes. Cuba has also two places designated for diving with sharks, Santa Lucia and Jardines de la Reina. Cuba has a prohibition on finning. In 2015 Cuba adopted a National Plan of Action for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks).<br/><br/>Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. <br/><br/>Potential protections and management measures are not known for the Southwest Atlantic or the eastern Atlantic Oceans.   To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It usually occurs to depths of 760 m, but has been reported to 1,752 m. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic  commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries that operate throughout its range. It is caught less frequently than the Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>) and is usually retained for the meat and fins. Most catches of the Longfin Mako are inadequately recorded and likely  underestimated in landings data, particularly as it is commonly misidentified as the Shortfin Mako. The Longfin Mako is of serious conservation concern due to its apparent rarity,  large maximum size, low fecundity, and continued, poorly-documented take in intensive fisheries. The limited available population trend data indicates strong declines and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% globally over the last three generations (75 years), similar to its congener, the Shortfin Mako. The Longfin Mako is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d. As this assessment includes only one time series and is based on suspected declines, the assessment should be revisited when catch data are available from more regions.</p>","The Longfin Mako is a poorly-known epi-, meso- and bathypelagic species found in tropical and  warm-temperate seas.

Very little is known of the biology of the Longfin  Mako.  It reaches a maximum size of at least 427 cm total length (TL); both males and females are reported to mature at &gt;245 cm TL, although the smallest observed mature male is 225 cm TL (Gilmore 1993, Castro <em>et al</em>. 1999, Varghese&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with oophagy and uterine cannibalism with litter sizes of possibly 2–8, and a size at birth of 97–120 cm TL (Castro <em>et al</em>. 1999, Compagno 2001). Age data are not available for this species, but data from the close relative the Shortfin Mako in the Northwest Atlantic were used to estimate a generation length of 25 years (Natanson <em>et al. </em>2006).","<em>  </em><p>  </p><p>The Longfin Mako is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The majority of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The Longfin Mako is likely less vulnerable to shallow set pelagic longline gear than the Shortfin Mako, because its preferred depth distribution is deeper than that of the Shortfin Mako.<a name=""_Hlk531871209""> For example in Sri Lanka, the proportional catches of the Longfin Mako to Shortfin Mako are less outside the </a><a name=""_Hlk531871209"">Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a> than within the EEZ; likely attributed to <a name=""_Hlk531871209"">surface longline gear set near the surface outside the EEZ compared to </a><a name=""_Hlk531871209"">longline gear set deeper on the continental shelf edge within the EEZ (D.

Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>Post-release mortality of pelagic sharks varies by species and has been reported as 30–33% for the closely-related Shortfin Mako on longlines (Campana <em>et al. </em>2016).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the population size or structure of the Longfin Mako. The only available population trend data are from standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Atlantic Ocean United States pelagic longline fishery. The observer data trends from this fishery were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al. </em>2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). The observer data were considered more reliable than the logbook data reported in Lynch <em>et al. </em>(2018).  The observer modelled catch rate data for 1992–2015 (24 years) showed declines to  the mid 1990s, followed by an increase to the mid 2000s and declines  thereafter (J. Carslon unpubl. data). The trend analysis of these data  revealed annual rates of decline of 3.7%, consistent with an estimated median decline of 93.4% over three generation lengths (75 years), with the highest probability of <u>&gt;</u>80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>The species is considered to occur in all oceans and hence population trend data are missing from the south Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, which accounts for approximately 80% of the species' range. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. Regions with no trend data are assumed to have declined by 0 to 100% (this range excludes the possibility that the regional trend may have increased), and a global trend estimated that incorporates this uncertainty. The global analyses estimated a median decline of 60.4% with the highest probability of&#160;<u>&gt;</u>80 % reduction over three generation lengths (75 years). Considering the large areas of the species distribution with no data, expert judgement suspected that global scale declines would be similar to those of the Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrinchus</em>), and in the range of 50–79% over three generation lengths. As this assessment includes only one time series and is based on suspected declines, the assessment should be revisited when catch data are available from more regions.</p>",Decreasing,"The Longfin Mako is widespread in tropical and warm temperate waters, and likely occurs in all oceans, although its distribution is poorly recorded (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).",<strong>  </strong><p>The meat and fins of the Longfin Mako are traded (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>,Marine,"The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. In 2008, the Longfin Mako was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation. In 2018, Mexico announced its intention to propose adding the Longfin Mako to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a “look alike” species with respect to the focus of the listing proposal, the Shortfin Mako. If the proposal is adopted at the 2019 CITES Conference, Longfin Mako exports from CITES Parties would need to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>The Longfin Mako is rarer than the Shortfin Mako<em>, </em>but the two species are often caught alongside each other and confused or combined in landings reports<em>.</em> The United States adopted a precautionary ban on retention of Atlantic Longfin Mako in 1999. There are no other known species-specific Longfin Mako catch limits.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended that Longfin Mako landings be  prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered.  Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional  and national limits on Longfin Mako catch based on scientific advice  and/or the precautionary approach, and promotion of safe release  protocols are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional  commitments agreed through international treaties.","",,false,false,Global

Reproduction is oviparous, and young hatch at 10 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is estimated as 13.5 years, close to that of the related and similarly-sized Whitedotted Skate (<em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 10 years and a maximum age of 17 years (Henderson <em>et al. </em>2005).","The Eyespot Skate is captured in intensive commercial and artisanal demersal trawl fisheries that operate throughout its geographic and depth range (Casarini 2006, Tamini <em>et al.</em> 2006, Orlando <em>et al.</em> 2011<em></em>). Industrial fishing effort began early and has increased rapidly in southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina, followed by similar increases in artisanal effort. In southern Brazil, the industrial trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing at depths of 20 to 1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Over half (58%) of stocks targeted there by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, and half of those have collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al. </em>2019). In  Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and  many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997 the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo<em> et al. </em>2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as many artisanal vessels are not registered. This species is captured but is typically still discarded in Uruguay (Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2018).  In Argentina, industrial trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and  increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006), and this species was caught in low numbers in the early 2000s (Crespi-Abril <em>et al. </em>2013). These fisheries are intense, they lack adequate management measures, and this skate does not have any refuge at depth. It is smaller and is likely to be more productive than the Critically Endangered Spotback Skate (<em>Atlantoraja castelnaui</em>), and therefore is likely to be less sensitive to fishing pressure than that species.","In southern Brazil there are no time-series of abundance, but fisheries there are intense and it is suspected that they are leading to population reduction. In Uruguay, research trawl catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of this species was 320  kg/hr during 1994–2003, and declined by 82% from 1,910 kg/hr in 2004–2013 to 343 kg/hr in&#160; 2013–2017 (L.

In 794 Uruguayan research trawls carried out in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) between 2010 and 2016, this species was recorded in 200 hauls (Paesch 2018). In the Uruguayan fisheries statistics for the coastal industrial trawler  fleet, this species was originally included in the generic category 'skates', which refers  mostly to the Smallnose Fanskate (<em>Sympterygia bonapartii</em>); however since 2014 a new category 'coastal rays' has been reported on. Landings have been variable but declined from over 75 t in 2014 to 17 t in 2016, and then increased to 57 t in 2018 (CTMFM 2018).

Captured pregnant females exhibit high rates of abortion and post-capture mortality, and likely do not survive release (Wosnick <em>et al.</em> 2019). <span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Furthermore, several demographic analyses reveal that this guitarfish has slow  growth and that current levels of fishing pressure are not sustainable  (Caltabellota 2014, Carmo<em> et al. </em>2018). Overall, this species is subjected to intense and mostly  unmanaged fishing pressure across its limited range, and it has no  refuge at depth. Its small size and relatively fast generation  time may provide it some ability to withstand fishing pressure, but not  at current levels of exploitation.<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","Artisanal and commercial fisheries are intense across the geographic and bathymetric range of this species, and declines in landings have been noted.&#160;Inferences have been drawn from two estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)&#160;from research trawl surveys in (1) Santa Catarina State,&#160;Brazil; and, (2) in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone; as well as from, (3) a demographic analysis of sustainability. First, in Santa Catarina state, CPUE decreased by 90% from 100 kg/hr in the 1980s to 10 kg/hr in 2005 (R. Barreto unpubl. data 2018), equivalent to a &gt;85% reduction over three generations. Second, in Uruguay, the research trawl survey CPUE of this species declined from 2,200 kg/hr in the 1980s and early 1990s to just over 1,400 kg/hr caught between 2013 and 2017 (L. Paesch unpubl. data 2018), equivalent to a &gt;25% population reduction if scaled over three generations. Third, demographic analyses have shown that this species is being overfished given the level of mortality it is exposed to (Caltabellota 2014, Carmo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Fishing pressure is intense elsewhere within the range of this guitarfish, and similar reductions in population size are suspected in other parts of Brazil and in Argentina. Overall, due to the  presence of intense and mostly unmanaged fishing pressure across its  range, and appropriate indices of abundance that exhibit declines, it is  suspected that the Shortnose Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (21  years).",Decreasing,"The Shortnose Guitarfish occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Espírito Santo state, Brazil to San&#160;Matías Gulf,&#160;Argentina (Cuevas, J.M. unpubl. data 2018). A historical record from further north in Bahia State from 1907 cited in Bigelow and Schroeder (1953) requires confirmation.","This guitarfish is heavily commercialized, highly valued, and sold locally for its meat (P. Charvet unpubl. data 2018).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in  place for this guitarfish. To conserve the population and permit recovery, a  suite of measures will   be required which will need to include species  protection, spatial   management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest management, all of which   will be dependent on effective enforcement.  Further research is needed   on population size and trends and  use and trade,  and  species-specific monitoring should be undertaken  in commercial and  artisanal fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

La Plata Skate is demersal on clay, mud, and sand substrates on the continental shelf and upper slope from inshore to 320 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 91 cm total length (TL); females mature at 69–72 cm TL and males at 62–63 cm TL (Oddone and Amorim 2008, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). As in other skates, reproduction is oviparous. This skate has an annual reproductive cycle, with an egg-laying season from January to September, that peaks in January (Peres and Vooren 1993). Generation length is estimated as 13.5 years, close to that of the related and similarly-sized Whitedotted Skate (<em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 10 years and a maximum age of 17 years (Henderson <em>et al. </em>2005).","The La Plata Skate is captured in demersal trawl fisheries which are intensive throughout its range (Casarini 2006<em>, </em>Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2011, Port <em>et al. </em>2016).  In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a   period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650   vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016).  In  Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late  1970s, and  many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera, 2016). This skate is among the two most abundant batoids taken as bycatch there (Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). These fisheries are intense, they lack adequate management  measures, and this skate does not have any refuge at depth. It  is smaller and is likely to be more productive than the Critically  Endangered congeneric Spotback Skate (<em>Atlantoraja castelnaui</em>), and therefore is likely to be less sensitive to fishing pressure than that species.","In southern Brazil, this skate is subjected to intense industrial and artisanal fishing pressure and it is suspected that this has led to declines in abundance. This species is caught rarely in Uruguay, and the coastal fleet there mostly captures its congeners and other skate species (CTMFM 2018). In Argentina, reported landings of skates in  general increased from 900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and  then declined to 24,000 t in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y  Pesca 2010, cited in Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). This species occured in 97% of these trawl landings between 2007 and 2009, comprising over 34% of relative abundance and over 41% of relative weight (Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2011). Trawl landings data for rays &gt;90 cm total length in size from all of the  Southwest Atlantic show a sharp increase in the 1990s and 2000s, from   less than 1,000 t to a peak of nearly 4,000 t in 2007. Landings then   declined to 1,000–1,500 t between 2008 and 2013 despite increased effort  (Port <em>et al. </em>2016, FAO 2019), equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;99% if scaled over three generations (40.5 years). These reported landings  data are not  species-specific, but they do suggest a substantial increase  in fishing  pressure over the past several decades, and the more recent  declines in landings may represent a reduction in population size. Although it is still common in catches, due to heavy fishing pressure across its range, inadequate management measures, its high catchability, and declines in reported overall skate landings, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (40.5 years).",Decreasing,"The La Plata Skate occurs in the Southwest Atlantic<span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92""> from <span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92""><span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92""><span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92""><span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92"">Espírito Santo, Brazil to Chubut, Argentina<span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92""> <span id=""dscexpitem_-515408546_19""><span data-bm=""92"">(Last <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","This species is retained as a utilized bycatch and is sold locally or traded internationally to Asian markets for its meat (Casarini 2006, Dent and Clarke 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in  place for this skate.

Further research is needed  on life history and population size and trends, and  species-specific monitoring should be undertaken.","",,false,false,Global
3119790,63116,Dipturus trachydermus,Endangered,A2bd,2020,2019-02-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Roughskin Skate (<em>Dipturus trachydermus</em>) is a large skate (to 265 cm total length) that occurs in the Southeast Pacific and Southwest Atlantic from Coquimbo,  Chile (31°S), south around Cape Horn and north to Río de la  Plata, Uruguay, including the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). It is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 85–480 m, but is most commonly found at 200–350 m in Chile and shallower (80–150 m) in Argentina. It is captured in industrial trawl fisheries for hake (<em>Merluccius </em>spp.), and artisanal bottom longline fisheries that encompass nearly the entire geographic and depth range of this species in Chile and Argentina. In Chile, it was a secondary catch of the target skate fishery which ramped up in 1993 as a direct result of the arrival of Korean skate traders who provided a market that incentivised fishers to target and retain this species for international trade. Despite quota management since 1997, the fishery peaked in around 2003 and landings started to decline until the target fisheries were closed in 2016. There may be some refuge for the species in the extensive coastline of southern Chile which consists of many fjords and canals where fishing activities are not operating at present. The current skate fishery in Chile is considered to be ‘fully exploited’ and the high percentage of juveniles present in catches and the decreasing trend of the catch size are symptoms of a fishing collapse. The stock assessment of the target Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) indicated a reduction of 73.1% over three generation lengths for that species (52.5 years), with the highest probability (95%) of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. In Argentina, reported landings of skates in general increased from 900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, due to export demand from Korea. Whole small specimens and wings of larger Roughskin Skate are landed, frozen, and traded to Korea for the ‘Hongeo’ market. There is no local consumption. Overall, this skate is subject to intense and inadequately managed  fishing pressure throughout most of its range, there is little refuge at  depth, it has limiting life history characteristics, and other similar  species in the region have exhibited substantial population reductions. As a result, it is suspected that the Roughskin Skate has undergone a population  reduction of  50–79% over the past three generations (64.5 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.&#160;</p>","The Roughskin Skate&#160;is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 85–480 m (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016); it is most common at 180–350 m in Chile, but in Argentina it may be found much shallower at depths of 80–150 m (Vargas-Caro <em>et al. </em>2015). It reaches as a maximum size of 265 cm total length (TL) (Licandeo <em>et al.</em> 2007); females mature at 215 cm TL and males at 195 cm TL (Licandeo <em>et al.</em> 2007). Reproduction is oviparous; an annual reproductive cycle is suspected and size-at-hatching is 20 cm TL (Endicott&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Female age-at-maturity is 17 years and maximum age is 26 years (Francis and Gallagher 2009); generation length is therefore estimated to be 21.5 years (Licandeo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).","This skate is intensively fished in both the Southeast Pacific and Southwest Atlantic Oceans. Relatively few fisheries specifically target elasmobranch fishes in Chilean waters, but among those, the Yellownose skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) and the Roughskin Skate (<em>Dipturus trachydermus</em>) are the most valuable species (Vargas-Caro <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Chile, Roughskin Skate is captured as secondary target of the target fishery for Yellownose Skate driven by export demand from Korea since 1993. Roughskin Skate faces bycatch fishing pressure since the target Yellownose Skate fishery was closed from 2013 to 2016. Formerly, this species was caught in three main fisheries in Chile: (1) the artisanal multispecies skate longline fishery off central and southern Chile which fished at depths of 180–350 m, (2) bycatch in commercial fisheries for Southern Hake (<em>Merluccius australis</em>), and (3) in artisanal bottom longline fisheries for Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), however, this latter fishery catches relatively few individuals. Landings of Roughskin Skate may have been underestimated as the largest individuals (&gt;10 kg) were ‘winged’ while the target Yellownose Skate were landed whole (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2005). The largest animals (e.g., greater than 30 kg) may be cut-off and discarded alive rather than brought on board, because of the large size and difficulty in handling these animals (C. Bustamante pers. comm. 2019).<br/>  <p>Since 1979, there were industrial and artisanal landings in Chile of &gt;4,000 tonnes per year of six skate species with the catch dominated by Yellownose Skate and Roughskin Skate. These two species were not separated in catch landing statistics until 2003 (Vargas-Caro <em>et al.</em> 2015). Between 1999 and 2000 there was an important increase in mainly artisanal landings with a maximum landing of 4,151 t during 2000, which then dropped to 3,000 t in 2001 and has been declining since (Vargas-Caro <em>et al.</em> 2015). South of 41°28.6'S, both Yellownose Skate and Roughskin Skate are taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries for Southern Hake and in artisanal fisheries for Pink Cusk-eel. Captures in 2002 were ~2,000 t for both Yellownose Skate and Roughskin Skate combined, and since 2005, there have been quotas put in place in these southern fishing grounds. Before the fishery was closed, in the artisanal multispecies longline fishery off central and southern Chile (39°15' to 41°28.6'S), the catch was regulated by quota for Yellownose Skate and Roughskin Skate. Since 2000, 30% of artisanal landings within this fishery (between IX and X Regions) have been monitored and comprise 85% Yellownose Skate, 10% Roughskin Skate, with the remaining 5% made up of Whitedotted Skate (<em>Bathyraja albomaculata</em>), Broadnose Skate (<em>B. brachyurops</em>), Graytail Skate (<em>B. griseocauda</em>), and Brazilian Skate (<em>Rajella sadowskii</em>) (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2010). The artisanal directed bottom longline fishery for Yellownose Skate has been closed since 2016. Landings are not allowed, but the bottom longline gear continues to be used and the Roughskin Skate may still be captured.</p><p>There is some refuge off southern Chile, which consists of   many fjords and canals where fishing activities are not operating at   present. Artisanal fishing   activities in the area generally only operate close to small towns such as Chiloé,   Aysén, and Punta Arenas. <br/></p>  <p>In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al.</em> 2006). By 1992, there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in 1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación Pesquera 2016). In Argentina, reported landings of skates in general increased from 900 t in 1993 to a peak of 28,000 t in 2007, and then declined to 24,000 t in 2009–2010 (Ministerio de Agricultura Ganadería y Pesca 2010, cited in Estalles <em>et al.</em> 2011). Skates and rays are caught mainly as bycatch by industrial bottom trawlers targeting Argentinian Hake and Patagonian Red Shrimp, although since 1999 they have also been targeted by a longliner with a maximum allowable catch of 1,800 t per year (Estalles <em>et al. </em>2011). This species is taken as bycatch of the Red Shrimp fishery captured in 9.3% of hauls in double beam trawls at depths of 87–97 m (Cedrola <em>et al. </em>2005). This species is now rare in the Patagonian Sea and typically found slightly deeper than the 100 m isobath at the southern Gulf of San Jorge.&#160;</p><p>                    </p><p>This species is infrequently captured in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Arkhipkin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Winter <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>","<p>There are no population estimates for this skate. In Chile, industrial trawl fisheries for Southern Hake (<em>Merluccius australis</em>), and artisanal bottom longline fisheries encompass the Southeast Pacific geographic and depth range of this species, with patches of refuge in southern Chile. In Argentina, this species is taken as bycatch of Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus muelleri</em>) trawl fisheries and of Argentinian Hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>) fisheries. These fisheries are intense, they lack adequate management measures, and this skate does not have any refuge at depth.&#160;</p><p>The Chilean target skate fishery was closed between 2013–2016 but this species is still taken as significant retained bycatch, particularly in&#160;the South Pacific Hake (<em>Merluccius gayi</em>) and artisanal longline fisheries. The current skate fishery (<em>Dipturus </em>spp.) in Chile is considered to be ‘fully exploited’ and the high percentage of juveniles present in catches, the decreasing trend of the catch size, as well as the constant fishing effort and landings, are symptoms of a fishing collapse for the Roughskin Skate, as suggested for Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) (Bustamante <em>et al.</em> 2012). Initial landings in late 1970s and early 1980s were due to exploratory fisheries. While variable, landings subsequently increased steadily as a direct result of the arrival of Korean skate traders in 1993, who provided a market that incentivised fishers to target and retain this species for international trade. The fishery peaked and landings started to decline after around 2003 (Vargas-Caro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;The target fishery was closed in 2016. <br/></p><p>                              </p><p>An indication of the population trend is available from a stock assessment of the Yellownose Skate, which reveals that total biomass over 1979–2006 (27 years) exhibited annual rates of reduction of 2.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 73.1% over three generation lengths (52.5 years), with the highest probability (95%) of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. Given that this species is large-bodied and has a similar depth distribution to the target Yellownose Skate, it is likely that the Roughskin Skate has also undergone similar declines.</p>This species is relatively uncommon and patchily distributed and fished throughout its depth and geographic range in the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the rapid rise in catches and export of skates has driven steep declines of this species in the Southwest Atlantic also.<br/><br/>Overall, this skate is subject to intense and inadequately managed fishing pressure throughout most of its range, there is little refuge at depth, it has limiting life history characteristics, and other similar species have exhibited substantial population reductions.

It occurs on sandy and muddy habitats in the inner continental shelves down to depths of 150 m, but more typically in water less than 50 m deep.<br/><br/>This species is commonly taken in industrial and artisanal fisheries using demersal trawl, shrimp trawl, bottom set gillnets, and beach seine nets. They are retained and sold fresh, dried or smoked and are sometimes winged and may be traded internationally. The species was formerly common in coastal areas throughout its range. It is now largely absent from the north and eastern Mediterranean Sea and there have been no records of the species from the International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) since 1994. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. When catch declines are scaled to the conservative three generation lengths of the Spiny Butterfly Ray (33 years) they represent population reductions of 42.5% and 54% in Morocco and Senegal, respectively.<br/><br/>In the Northwest Atlantic and Western Central Atlantic, this species is rarely taken as bycatch and is not commercially targeted in U.S. waters. In southern Brazil, catch per unit effort from a research survey revealed a decline from 16.0 to 0.2 kg per hour between 1982–2005 equivalent to a population reduction of 98.8% over the three generation lengths (33 years).<br/><br/>In summary, this species is inferred to be Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean Sea and Southwest Atlantic, Endangered in&#160;Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, and Least Concern in Northwest and Western Central Atlantic. Overall, it is suspected that the Spiny Butterfly Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (33 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure and hence is assessed as&#160;Endangered&#160;A2d.</p>","<p>The Spiny Butterfly Ray occurs in shallow coastal waters, including the intertidal zone, over sand and mud habitats to a depth of 150 m, but more typically in depths of less than 50 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~260 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 78–130 cm DW, females mature at 102–108 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous and litter size varies geographically but generally 1–8 pups are produced annually after a 4–9 month gestation period and size-at-birth is estimated at 38–44 cm DW (Last <em>et al. 2</em>016). <a name=""_Hlk30751188"" style="""">Female age-at-maturity is around 4 years and maximum age is 18 years resulting in a generation length of 11 years (Parsons <em>et al. </em>2018).</a></p>","<p>The species is targeted and taken as bycatch with multiple fishing gears, including demersal trawl, gillnet, longline, and handline, and is retained for its meat. First, in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, demersal trawl effort has increased both in terms of vessels numbers and fishing power. For example, the Gulf of Lions was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp), but effort increased seven-fold to 19,940 hp between 1974 and 1987. Following this, half of the benthic trawl fishing effort was displaced to target small pelagic fishes (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets but landings data are not available (Jukic-Peladic&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).</p>Second, in Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, elasmobranchs were first exploited by semi-industrial fisheries during the 1950s, although these fisheries gradually collapsed (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Elasmobranchs were also caught as bycatch by small-scale fisheries and the flesh salted and dried for consumption. The total artisanal total fishing effort increased 10-fold between 1950 and 2010&#160;(Walker <em>et al. </em>2005, Belhabib <em>et al. </em>2018). Industrial fisheries have increased with demersal and shrimp trawlers increasing&#160;by&#160;more than 64% from 190 vessels in 1950 to 1,200 vessels in 2010 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). The reported landings of elasmobranchs has risen steadily since the 1950s and the mid-1990s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Sharks and rays constitute 1–2% of all reconstructed catches and a large fraction of the catch is reported in the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem with nearly one-quarter taken by Morocco and a significant fraction taken by Nigeria (D. Belhabib pers. comm. 25/08/2020).&#160;Overall, there has been a 34% decline in total catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) between the 1950s and the 2000s, driven mainly by a 60% decrease in the artisanal CPUE (Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">Elasmobranch meat is an important source of protein for many countries in Africa (Walker&#160;<em>et al. </em>2005). A large market for salted and dried flesh is centralized in the Gambia and Mauritania region, where a Ghanaian community operates an export business to Ghana via Senegal. Guinea and Mali import large quantities of smoked elasmobranch flesh from the West Africa region. <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The Spiny Butterfly Ray was formerly common all along the West African coast. The species is targeted along with other benthic sharks and rays and caught in large mesh benthic gillnets targeting guitarfishes in West Africa. It is also taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal demersal trawls, shrimp trawls, and in artisanal fisheries using longlines and handlines. These fisheries are not managed over a large portion of this species range and are intense and increasing in many areas. There is a long history of heavy fishing pressure throughout this species' inshore and shallow water habitat that is unlikely to be reduced in the coming years (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2007, 2020). Although large individuals are still landed sometimes from Mauritania south to Guinea, artisanal fishers and other observers indicate that the abundance has dropped severely and that the median size has been dramatically reduced as most of the adults have been removed by fishing activity (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). Even in the Banc d'Arguin National Park, Mauritania, where it is normally fully protected, incidental captures occur and consist of more than 90% juveniles and subadults, whereas large individuals were common in the 1980s (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). Pregnant Spiny Butterfly Ray females have been observed in the landings of artisanal coastal fisheries in Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea-Bissau, suggesting that this species is giving birth in coastal shallow waters where the fishing pressure is intense (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). This species is still commonly captured in Ghana (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020) but rare in Congo and Cameroon (P. Doherty and A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Ghana, the Spiny Butterfly Ray can comprise 1.5% of rays captured in demersal trawls (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). In the artisanal fishery, for example in 2018 Seret’s Butterfly Ray (<em>G. sereti</em>) were&#160;caught by longlines in the delta of Ogouée with a CPUE of 41.2 kg/day per fishing boat, representing 15.9% of the catches (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). The pressure on Gymnuridae seems low, with less than 0.1% of rays observed but their catch is regular and it is the importance of both Dasyatidae and Rajidae catch that explain the apparent low catch rate and pressure upon Gymnuridae.&#160;However, without proper time-series of catch data for this species, we cannot exclude that this low rate of catches is due to a collapse of the population resulting from the higher fishing pressure in the past&#160;(G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).&#160;<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><p>Third, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, this species is outside the range of, and hence not caught by, most commercial fisheries and is not commercially targeted in United States waters.</p><p>Fourth, in the Southwest Atlantic, particularly in southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Argentina, fishing pressure is intense in the southern limit of this species' range where it is captured along Rio de la Plata and down to Quequén.<br/></p><p>Coastal development, pollution, and anthropogenic disturbance through tourism activities are also a threat to the species' shallow coastal habitat, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea and Southwest Atlantic.</p><br/><br/></span></span></span></span>","<p>This species occurs in four broad ocean regions: Mediterranean and Black Sea, Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, and Southwest Atlantic.<br/><br/>First, in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, the Spiny Butterfly Ray was a common catch of demersal trawl and setnet fisheries throughout the Mediterranean Sea, the southern part in particular. In the 1980s, this species was frequently captured in the Sicilian Channel and landed in Mazzara del Vallo (Trapani, Sicily), but now it is absent from the local catch record (M. Vacchi unpubl. data 2015). There have been no records of the species from the International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) since 1994 (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001, Follesa <em>et al.</em> 2020), indicating that it is perhaps absent from most of the northern Mediterranean Sea. However, the survey design and gear used is not well-suited to capturing this shallow, inshore species. For example, the survey avoids the <em>Posidonia</em> seagrass beds where this species can sometimes be found (F. Serena unpubl. data 2020). Occasional specimens are captured in demersal  fisheries, for example one adult male was captured in recent years near  Anzio, Italy—now deposited in the collection of the University of  Naples (Psomadakis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005)—and one specimen was captured in the Southern Adriatic in 2000 (Dulčić&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003), indicating that the species is not yet locally extinct in the  central Mediterranean Sea. This species is more common where the  development of fisheries has been slower or fishing has been banned. It  is still regularly present in some parts of the southern and eastern  Mediterranean Sea (Bariche 2012). For example, this species seems more  commonly captured in the eastern Mediterranean, e.g. Syria (Alkusairy <em>et al.</em> 2014). This pattern seems similar to that of the Critically Endangered Angelshark (<em>Squatina squatina</em>)  (and other large benthic rays), which now seems to be more prevalent in  the less fished eastern and southern Mediterranean Sea and absent from  the northern and western Mediterranean, which has a longer history of  fishery development. In the Canary Islands (Spain), trawling has been  banned since 1980 and consequently Spiny Butterfly Ray is still commonly  seen, along with other batoids rarely seen elsewhere in European waters  (Lawson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020, Tuya <em>et al.</em> 2020). It is  suspected that a population reduction of &gt;80% has occurred for  this species over the last 30 years, which is within three generation  lengths <span lang=""EN-US"">of the Spiny Butterfly Ray (33 years).</p><p></p>Second, in Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic<span lang=""EN-US"">, the greatest fishing effort and largest elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (Walker <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;In Morocco, reconstructed landings of grouped ray data showed a 32% decline in landings over 23 years from 1993 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 2,814 t in 1950 to 4,603 t in 1979 then declined to 3,432 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 6,700 t in 1993 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,590 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<span lang=""EN-US""> In Senegal, reconstructed landings data for sharks,  rays, and skates data showed a at 30% decline – and possibly as much as  an 80% decline – over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose  from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in  1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a  fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).  These declines in landings can be inferred to represent a population  reduction, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the  period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). <span lang=""EN-US"">In Ghana, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and  skates data have been rising since the 2,000s but showed a 27% decline  over the years from 2013 to 2016. Historically, catches gradually rose from  154 t in 1950 to 15,536 t in 1975 then declined to 1,122 t in 1997,  then rose steeply to a peak of 12,858 t in 2013 followed by a  fluctuating decline to 9,422 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020).

When these declines are scaled to the conservative three generation lengths of the Spiny Butterfly Ray (33 years) they represent population reductions of 42%, 97%, 97% and in Morocco, Senegal, and Ghana respectively. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.

Skate and ray landings in the artisanal fishery of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil have declined dramatically since the early 1950s as a result of overfishing (Klippel&#160;<em>et. al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;This species is taken by demersal multispecies trawl, beach-seine, and recreational hook and line fisheries in southern Brazil (Vooren&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It is regarded as a good food fish and has been landed commercially in southern Brazil from at least 1986 onwards (Figueiredo 1977, Araujo and Vooren 1989). The species was frequently observed in beach-seine catches in the 1980s but had disappeared from these catches and only occurred sporadically in trawl landings in 2002–2003 (Ferreira <em>et al. </em>2010). This strong decline in abundance is attributed to intense trawl fishing all year-round in coastal waters. In southern Brazil, population reduction could be estimated from a demersal trawl survey with catch rates standardized for groundrope length, revealing a decline from 16.0 kg per hour in January 1982 (20 trawl hauls), and 0.2 kg per hour in February 2005 (62 trawl hauls) (Naves and Vooren 2001, Vooren&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). This decline in catch-per-unit-effort is equivalent to a population reduction of 99% over the three generation lengths of the Spiny Butterfly Ray (33 years).&#160;The threat of intense coastal fishing pressure continues throughout its coastal range&#160;in this region&#160;and as a result this species was listed as Critically Endangered (A2bcd) on the Brazilian National Red List (ICMBio 2018). Coastal fishing pressure is also intense in Argentina, at the southern limit of this species' distribution. This species has occasionally been reported in catches along the coast of Argentina from Rio de la Plata to Quequén and has been reported as irregular in the demersal catches at Mar del Plata (Menni and Stehmann 2000). Batoids are an important resource in most demersal trawl fisheries in Argentina (Tamini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). A coastal multispecies demersal trawl fishery operates off Quequén, in which bycatch of batoids fluctuates seasonally between 44.5% and 67.5% of total catch (Tamini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). This species was not reported in a recent study of the bycatch of this fishery (Tamini&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006) and a lack of historical information prevents a comparison of temporal trends. Fishing pressure is intense throughout the Spiny Butterfly Ray's range, and it is likely that similar declines have occurred in areas where data are lacking.&#160;The disappearance of this species from beach-seine catches in southern Brazil in 2002–2003 and the decline of 99% in abundance since 1982 observed in those coastal waters warrant a regional assessment of Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic.</p><p>In summary, this species is inferred to be <span lang=""EN-US"">Critically Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, Endangered in West Africa, and Least Concern in Northwest and Western Central Atlantic. Overall the Spiny Butterfly Ray is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure, and hence is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</span></p></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Spiny Butterfly Ray is patchily distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, with a discontinuous range in the Americas.

In the European Union waters and the Mediterranean Sea the Spiny Butterfly Ray was listed in Appendix II of the Barcelona Convention. Parties to the Barcelona Convention agreed in 2012 that all elasmobranch species listed in Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean Sea – which includes Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1 – cannot be retained on board, transshipped, landed, transferred, stored, sold or displayed or offered for sale, and must be released unharmed and alive, to the extent possible. These listings do not appear to have an implementation mechanism (Lawson and Fordham 2018). Skate and ray total allowable catches (TACs) were established in 2009 for European Union waters from which Spiny Butterfly Ray has been reported (Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters) and have been gradually reduced each year since. Separate TACs are now in place for International Council for the Exploration of the Sea subareas and those for subareas VIII (Bay of Biscay) and IX (Iberian waters) combined are set at 3,800 tonnes per year of all skate and ray species grouped.<br/><p>This species may have some refuge in two large protected areas.

Metcalfe 25/08/2020).&#160;While there is protection, however, this species may still be taken illegally as bycatch.&#160;Sharks and rays are protected according to&#160;park management plans, but interviews with the fishing community and fisheries observer data reveal a designated shark fishing season. Further, fishers use nets made to target Meagre (<em>Argyrosomus regius</em>) in the shallow subtidal areas to target elasmobranchs (G.

Historical rapid and extensive deforestation is considered to have been the biggest threat to this species and is likely to have significantly reduced and fragmented its distribution and abundance. Most remaining suitable adult habitat exists in protected high county locations, however some suitable habitat at lower altitudes is susceptible to further development for agriculture and forestry. Evidence of poor recruitment suggests migratory juveniles are particularly susceptible to impacts within the lower catchment and /or are limited by a sparse, highly fragmented adult population. Impacts on the population resulting from the harvest of whitebait are possible, but unquantified. This species is assessed as Endangered based on a suspected population decline of at least 50% over the past 30 years (3 generations) based on observed, but un-quantified declines at known sites and ongoing declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality caused by deforestation and development in lowland areas where suitable habitat currently&#160;still exists. If specific trend data were available, it is suspected that the actual rates of decline could be higher than this and the species may qualify as Critically Endangered. Additionally, the area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is less than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. The population is suspected to be severely fragmented and there is a continual decline in area, extent and quality of habitat and the number of mature individuals, meaning this species also meets the Endangered category under the geographic range criteria.","<em>G. postvectis</em> is a large, nocturnal galaxiid species that occurs in foothill streams upwards to altitudes of about 500 m above sea level. Although it penetrates well inland in many catchments, it appears to be restricted to fast flowing&#160;streams located in native forest catchments, featuring pools and large boulder substrates with large interstitial spaces (NIWA 2013, McDowall <em>et al</em>.1996). In-stream cover and shading are key habitat features. This species was formerly considered obligatorily diadromous, but in 2009 the first land-locked population was discovered in an Auckland reservoir. As this species has been so rarely encountered, little is known about its life history. <em>G. postvectis</em> lives to at least 15 years, maturing at about 2-3 years (McDowall 2000) with a generation time of about 10 years (B. David pers. comm. 2014). Spawning occurs during autumn/winter and close to typical adult habitats. Eggs develop terrestrially after being deposited in riparian vegetation during high water events, hatching after reinundation. Larvae are carried downstream to rear in marine environments and return to freshwater after 4-6 months as whitebait (Charteris <em>et al.</em> 2003). This species feeds extensively on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates (McDowall 2000).","Considering its habitat preferences, the&#160;historical rapid and extensive deforestation is considered to have been the biggest threat to this species and is likely to have significantly reduced and fragmented its distribution and abundance.

It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, where it appears to be uncommon. The Undulate Ray occurs in shelf waters down to about 200 m depth, although it is more common in shallow waters. This species is taken as utilised bycatch by trawl, trammel net and other demersal fisheries. Its patchy distribution means that populations are widely separated, possibly with little exchange. In the areas where it is known to be locally common, available data suggest declines have occurred. Time series catch data from Tralee Bay, southwestern Ireland (where this species forms a discreet subpopulation) show that catches of this species have declined by 60-80% since 1981, although they fluctuate each year. The species has also traditionally been observed in English beam trawl surveys in the eastern English Channel, but has been absent in recent years. French landings of this species from the Celtic Seas have declined steeply during the past decade. Another major area of occurrence is southern Portugal, where it is the most common skate captured by the mixed species trammel net fisheries. Species-specific landings data are not collected, but overall landings of <em>Raja</em> species have decreased by 29% between 1988 and 2004 in this area. This medium-bodied skate has limiting life-history characteristics that make it more vulnerable to exploitation than smaller skate species (three year generation period of ~45 years). Given the Undulate Ray's life-history characteristics, documented species-specific declines in some areas and the declines in aggregate catch data, significant declines are also inferred to have occurred off southern Portugal. Although no specific data are available from western Africa, intensive artisanal and demersal trawl fisheries operate throughout its inshore range there. Due to the patchy distribution of this inshore species, and that it is thought to have declined in major areas of its range, it is assessed as Endangered.","This skate occurs in shelf waters to about 200 m depth, on sandy and muddy substrates and appears to be more common in shallow waters (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Coelho and Erzini 2006). Smaller specimens have been reported in coastal lagoons (specifically in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon on the South coast of Portugal), which suggests that this species may use these sheltered habitats as nursery areas (Coelho <em>et al.</em> 2002). Like other skates, reproduction is oviparous. Estimated asymptotic maximum size is110 cm total length (TL) (Coelho and Erzini 2002). Significant regional differences have been observed in size at first maturity of this species: In Portugal, females mature (50% maturity) at 76.2 cm TL in the Algarve (southern) region and at 83.8 cm TL in the Peniche (western) region, while males mature (50% maturity) at 73.6 cm TL in the Algarve and at 78.1 cm TL in Peniche. Age at first maturity for the Algarve population has been estimated to occur at 8.98 years in females and 7.66 years in males (Coelho and Erzini 2006). An annual reproductive cycle has been observed, but differences occur between the different populations: In southern Portugal this species breeds mainly during the winter (Coelho and Erzini 2006), while in the Portuguese west coast it breeds during the winter and the spring (Moura <em>et al. </em>2007). These differences seem to be related to water temperature, with reproduction restricted to periods of colder water. The maximum observed age for this species is 13 years old (Coelho and Erzini 2002) but longevity has been estimated at 21-23 years (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2002). The population on the South Portuguese coast has a very slow growth rate (k=0.11) (Coelho and Erzini 2002). Natural mortality for this population has been estimated to be 0.20-0.219 year<sup>-1</sup> (Coelho <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Generation period for this species varies from 14.9-15.9 years in females and from 14.3-15.3 in males. Generation period was estimated using the following formula: average reproductive age = age at maturity + 0.5* (longevity - age at maturity).<br/><br/><em>R. undulata</em> shows a dietary ontogenetic shift within three major length groups: 20-55 cm TL; 55-75 cm TL and 75-100 cm TL. This shift goes from small semi-pelagic to larger and benthic prey and from a generalised to a specialised diet. Shrimps and mysids are especially important in the diet of smaller specimens, while in larger specimens brachyuran crabs have an increased importance (Moura <em>et al.</em> 2008).","This species is a bycatch of trawl, trammel net and other demersal fisheries operating within its range. <em>Raja undulata</em> has a patchy distribution and declines have been documented in areas where is it was formerly considered locally abundant. Catch records are available from two charter-angling vessels in Tralee Bay (southwestern Island), where this species forms a discreet population. These data show that catches of this species declined from a high of 80-100 fish per year in 1981 to 20-30 fish per year in the mid 1990s (a decline of 60-70%), before increasing to 40-60 per year in 2001-2003. Catches now appear to be declining again, with less than 20 fish recorded in 2005, although they fluctuate each year (ICES 2007). <em>R. undulata</em> has traditionally been observed in English beam trawl surveys in the eastern English Channel, but has been absent for the most recent two years (ICES 2008). ICES advice (2008) is now for no target fishing in the North Sea, English Channel and Celtic Seas (ICES 2008).<br/><br/><em>Raja undulata</em> is captured in large quantities as bycatch in the mixed species trammel net fishery that operates off the southern coast of Portugal (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2002). The species is retained and marketed for human consumption. It is mainly captured in shallow waters, with CPUE values in this fishery decreasing from 1.91 specimens/1000m net at 10-30m depth to 0.03 specimens /1,000 m net at more than 90 m depth (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2005). Portuguese official fisheries statistics for landings of <em>Raja</em> spp. in the Algarve have decreased 29.1% between 1988 and 2004 (DGPA 1988-2004). <em>Raja undulata</em> is the most common skate species in this area and its size makes it more vulnerable to depletion than smaller skate species, and these declines may under-reflect changes in the population of this species (Erzini <em>et al.</em> 2001, Coelho <em>et al. </em>2005).<br/><br/>It is also a known bycatch of the Spanish demersal trawl fleet operating in the Cantabrian Sea, southern Bay of Biscay, which targets a mixture of gadoids and flatfish at depths of 100-300 m over the continental shelf (ICES 2007). Species-specific French landings data for the Celtic Seas report 12 t of <em>R. undulata</em> in 1995, 6 in 1996, 10 in 1997, after which landings fell to 2 t in 1998, 1 t in 1999, to 0 t in 2000-2001 (ICES 2007).<br/><br/>This species' preference for shallow waters places it within the range of intensive artisanal coastal fisheries operating along the western coast of Africa (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Although no specific details are currently available on catches, this species is presumably a utilised bycatch of these, and demersal trawl fisheries operating in this area. Exploitation of the continental shelf is also high in the Mediterranean Sea (Massuti and Moranta 2003).<br/><br/>Like many other larger skates, this species possesses life history characteristics that may increase vulnerability to exploitation, reduce rate of recovery and increase the risk of extinction: including delayed age at maturity, long generation time (14-15 years), low fecundity, and consequently slow population growth (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000).","There appears to be a discrete population of <em>Raja undulata</em> in Tralee Bay (ICES 2007). Angling records from Tralee Bay (Ireland) indicate a peak in records of undulate ray in 1981-1982, with lower (but stable) catches since then (ICES 2007). Undulate ray have traditionally been observed in English beam trawl surveys in the eastern English Channel, but have been absent for the most recent two years (ICES 2008). It is uncommon in the Bay of Biscay (ICES 2007).

Densities rarely exceed 20 fish per hectare in the preferred habitats of outer reefs; more typically not more than 10. Wherever it is fished, even if only moderately, density quickly declines to 25% or less of peak densities recorded at no fishing – this is known from 24 different studies based on fishery-independent data from 11 range states (Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 2003). It appears to be extirpated from several edge of range locations (Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 2003). It is particularly heavily exploited (i.e., high levels of fishing pressure) at the centre of its range in southeastern Asia where its coral reef habitat is most abundant, and particularly in key supply countries for the live reef fish trade, Malaysia and Indonesia, and out of Palawan, its stronghold in the Philippines. In these countries all available fishery-dependent and trade-related data suggest declines over 10–15 years in exploited areas of 10–fold or more with fish now considered rare in areas where once it was common. Buyers of this fish are continually having to source new areas as numbers decline and the pattern of fishing reported is one typical of rapid serial depletions. Much of the capture in all major source countries for live fish are of small fish, mainly juveniles, according to all reliable accounts. Moreover, juveniles are the preferred size range for retailers of live Humphead Wrasse. Severe declines have also been noted nationally wherever the species is taken by speargun at night. Such is the concern for this species that it is one of the only reef fish protected by name (i.e., species name) across a range of countries. It is everywhere accessible to live fish catcher boats which can visit the most remote locations at will. Some spawning aggregations have been noted to decline or have disappeared in eastern Malaysia and Australia. <br/> <br/>The total global catch of this species is estimated to be no more than 400 mt annually (Sadovy <em>et al</em>. 2003), yet despite this low volume, severe declines are noted in all places for which data are available and occurring very soon after fishing begins, reducing numbers by more than 50% (see country accounts and summary table) (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) and where management is not effective. Much of the trade is now in juvenile fish which is the preferred market size for live fish. It is severely reduced anywhere that it is fished unless a) it is effectively managed, b) there is no export trade or night spearfishing, and c) it is not included in marine protected areas. It is a species that appears to be highly <strong>conservation-dependent</strong>. There is no regional fishery management authority for this species and FAO does not collect data on it. <br/> <br/>The listing of this species as Endangered is based on a population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations (approximately 30 years) based on an index of abundance and actual or potential levels of exploitation (A2bd). The declines are predicted to continue or even accelerate because of the likely growth of the live fish export trade (A3bd). <br/> <br/>This species can live at least 30 years (25 for males and 32 for females) and becomes sexually mature at six years (J.H. Choat, C.R. Davies, J. Ackerman and B.D. Mapstone, unpublished manuscript). This means that its generation time is expected to be in the order of 10 years and that the rate of intrinsic population increase is likely to be low; natural predators are few and natural mortality rate was determined to be 0.14 or less (J.H. Choat, C.R. Davies, J. Ackerman and B.D. Mapstone, unpublished manuscript). The species is particularly vulnerable because the bulk of the fishery for live fish, at least in east Malaysia, southwest Philippines and Indonesia (the major suppliers for the live reef fish trade and the centre of the species’ range) is selective for juvenile sized fish since this is the preferred size class for consumers and gains the highest prices. This selective fishery for animals below but close to the size of sexual maturation has the potential to severely reduce the reproductive capability of exploited populations.  The species cannot be artificially cultured (i.e., hatchery produced) to relieve fishing pressure. <br/> <br/>The declines are projected to continue or worsen in key source countries for live fish because: <br/>a) The species is one of the two most highly valued fish, economically, in the luxury live reef fish trade on a per kg basis; <br/>b) Of the probable intrinsic vulnerability of such a large and long-lived reef fish, that is also hermaphroditic with relatively few adult males, and an aggregation-spawner, to overfishing; and <br/>c) In places where the species has declined but is still actively sought, fishers only find a few fish a month or a year, at most; <br/>d) The projected growth in the live fish trade, especially into mainland China in the next few years. <br/> <br/>Finally, despite regulations in many places, there is much illegal, unregulated and unmonitored trade, according to many verbal accounts by fishers and traders and there is no regional management authority actively engaged in managing this small fishery and FAO does not collect data on it. It only remains abundant where protected or not fished at all. Protective legislation in most places appears to be ineffective. <br/> <br/>See the Supplementary Material for a summary of the population data derived from fishery-indepent and fishery dependent sources.","In one study, small post-settlement humphead wrasses were found in a species of seagrass (<em>Enhalys acoroides</em>), four species of hard coral (three <em>Acropora</em> spp. and <em>Porites cylindricus</em>), and in the soft coral <em>Sarcophyton</em> sp. (branching form; M.A. Tupper, pers. comm.). After settlement, juveniles and adults live associated with reef or near-reef habitats of seagrass beds and mangrove areas, with juveniles typically inshore and the largest individuals found in deeper waters of outer reefs or lagoons (Myers 1999). Juveniles of 3–20 cm TL, and larger, occur in coral-rich areas of lagoon reefs, particularly among live thickets of staghorn, <em>Acropora</em> spp. corals, in seagrass beds, murky outer river areas with patch reefs, shallow sandy areas adjacent to coral reef lagoons, and mangrove and seagrass areas inshore (Randall 1955, Randall<em>et al</em>. 1978, Myers 1999, J.H. Choat, pers. comm.).  Recruitment patterns may vary considerably between years (M.A. Tupper, unpublished data). Adults are more common offshore than inshore, their presumed preferred habitat being steep outer reef slopes, reef drop-offs, reef tops, channel slopes, reef passes, and lagoon reefs to at least 100 m. They are usually found in association with well-developed coral reefs (Vivien 1973, Randall <em>et al</em>l. 1978, Winterbottom <em>et al</em>. 1989, Allen and Swainston 1992, Sluka 2000). Typically they are solitary or paired, but have also been noted in groups of 3–7 individuals (Donaldson 1995). They appear to be somewhat sedentary in that the same individuals, indentifiable by distinct natural markings, may be seen along the same stretch of reef for extended periods.  Indeed, many commercial dive sites have their ‘resident’ Humphead Wrasse, a favoured species for divers.  Natural densities are evidently never high, even in presumed preferred habitats. For example, in unfished or lightly fished areas, densities may range from two to rarely more than 10–20 individuals per 10,000 m² of suitable reef. In fished areas, however, densities are typically lower by tenfold or more, and in some places fish no longer appear to be present.
<br/>
<br/>Accounts of reproductive activity in the field reveal that, depending on location, this species spawns between several and all months of the year, in small or large groupings, that spawning coincides with certain phases of the tidal cycle, and that groups of spawning fish can form daily, at a range of different reef types. Spawning areas and aggregated adults have been noted regularly along specific sections of reef, sometimes associated with no obvious topographical features, sometimes close to the shelf edge on outer reefs, or adjacent to exposed reef passes near fairly steep drop-offs, or on mid-shelf (unspecified) reefs (P.L. Colin, J.H. Choat, R. Hamilton, S. Oakley, pers. comms.). The species is evidently a daily spawner that probably does not migrate far to its spawning site(s), spawning for extended periods each year, i.e., a ‘resident’ spawner (Domeier and Colin 1997, P.L. Colin, pers. comm.): groups of up to 150 fish were observed in Palau along the shelf edge in a loose aggregation.
<br/>
<br/>Probable spawning aggregations have also been noted on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Fiji, New Caledonia, and in the Solomon Islands. Although spawning was not always observed, aggregated fish were ripe, or exhibiting behaviour likely associated with spawning. On the GBR, aggregations of up to 10 large males and 20–50 smaller fish (35–95 cm TL) were noted (J.H. Choat, pers. comm.). GBR aggregations from the Ribbon Reefs and north of Jewell Reef, once noted to include hundreds of fish, are no longer known at the same sites (Johannes and Squire 1988, L. Squire, pers. comm.).
<br/>
<br/>The longevity of this species is up to at least 32 years, with females outliving the males (the oldest female recorded was 32 years), and sexual maturity is reached at about eight years of age (Choat in Pogonosky <em>et al</em>. 2002). Histological studies show that sexual maturation is reached at a size of between 40 cm and 60 cm total length (Sadovy, unpublished data). This species is thought to be a protogynous hermaphrodite, with sex reversal occurring at about 15 years of age (Choat in Pogonosky <em>et al</em>. 2002). At a total length of approximately 111 cm (Lau and Li 2000). Males grow very rapidly (Choat in Pogonosky <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>It feeds on a variety of molluscs, fishes, sea urchins, crustaceans and other invertebrates (Randall <em>et al</em>. 1997).","Threats include: <br/> <br/>1) Intensive and species-specific removal for the live reef food fish export trade of a naturally uncommon and vulnerable species; <br/>2) Readily accessible to spearfishing at night with SCUBA or hookah (i.e., compressed air) gear, and easy to catch with cyanide, or other poisons such as <em>Derris trifoliata</em>, due to predictable adult habitat and shallow depth range; <br/>3) Lack of coordinated, consistent national and regional management largely due to limited management capacity and the sometime secretive nature of traders – in particular there is no relevant regional fishery management authority to address problems with this species; <br/>4) Selective fishing, in particular the intensive take of juveniles for direct export sale and for grow-out (also referred to as ‘culture’ – the species cannot be hatchery reared; and <br/>5) Illegal, unregulated, or unreported (IUU) fisheries (Donaldson and Sadovy 2001). <br/> <br/>In addition, the species’ essential coral reef habitat is seriously threatened by human activity throughout the Indo-Pacific region.  Destructive fishing practices, such as sodium cyanide use which stuns animals for capture and incidentally kills living coral, have been well documented and are spreading in the Indo-Pacific region (Barber and Pratt 1998, Burke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 1998, Johannes and Riepen 1995).  Despite its prohibition in many countries (including major exporters such as the Philippines and Indonesia), cyanide is still the preferred method for capturing certain live reef fish for international trade in some areas (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 1998, Johannes and Riepen 1995, Barber and Pratt 1998).  Indeed, larger Humphead Wrasse are difficult to catch any other way, other than by night-time capture.  When cyanide is applied, the fish often retreats into a crevice and becomes increasingly lethargic as the toxin reduces its ability to take up oxygen.  Divers may break away the living coral to get access to the hiding area, and remove the fish to clean water where it will often recover for shipment or holding in net pens. <br/> <br/>The most serious threat to this species is overfishing for the live fish export trade. They are mainly taken live for food – only rarely for the aquarium trade as far as can be determined.  This species is long-lived and naturally uncommon, and if it is similar to other reef fishes of similar size and biology (e.g., sequential hermaphroditism; aggregation-spawner) it is expected to have low rates of replacement and therefore be particularly vulnerable to fishing pressure (Donaldson and Sadovy 2001).  Moreover, being one of the largest of all reef fishes, they have few natural predators which means that fishing mortality may rapidly exceed natural mortality, possibly accounting for the rapid declines noted once fishing intensifies. <br/> <br/>Although data are not available from throughout its range, wherever there are significant exports and no effective controls, fish numbers have declined substantially within a decade or less and exploitation rates are expected to continue, or more likely, intensify. There are few refuges for this species since live reef fish carriers have access to all reefs where it occurs and it does not extend into very deep water, probably little more than 60 m. Adults only occur in reasonable numbers where the fishery is effectively managed or where they occur in marine protected areas. <br/> <br/>There has been speculation that Humphead Wrasse, and other reef fishes, can be cultured or ""farmed"" to meet international demand.  However, it appears that the use of cultured fish may actually pose a threat to wild populations in certain circumstances since it does not involve hatchery production (not yet possible for this species and unlikely to be possible at commercial levels for many years according to experienced aquarist M.A. Rimmer, pers. comm.) but the grow-out of wild sourced juveniles.","Abundance estimates on northern Queensland (Australia) reefs are 2.5–3.5 adults per 8000 m² (Choat in Pogonosky <em>et al</em>. 2002).

<br/>There are no data on total numbers of this fish globally. However, adults are largely limited to outer reef areas which are a small proportion of the total reef area within its distribution and, even in preferred habitats, densities are very low for a commercially exploited species (rarely &gt; 10 fish per 10,000 square meter when not fished). It is considered uncommon to rare naturally. Nothing is known about the extent of subpopulations or degree of fragmentation but available suitable habitat is a major determinant of its distribution. Some edge of range extirpations are suspected.
<br/>
<br/>The species is hermaphroditic, changing sex from female to male. The sex ratio of samples and fish observed in the field is female biased. Under IUCN criteria for mature individuals, there should be a correction made to factor in the sex bias which effectively reduces substantially the estimates of fish numbers included in this assessment.",Decreasing,"The Humphead Wrasse is widely distributed on coral reefs and inshore habitats throughout much of the tropical Indo-Pacific, from western Indian Ocean and Red Sea to southern Japan, New Caledonia and into the central Pacific Ocean (see the Supplementary Material for a distribution map).

12473706,61408,Rostroraja alba,Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The size of this large benthic skate renders it particularly susceptible to capture by fishing gears, which in combination with its life history parameters and population demography allow little capacity for it to withstand exploitation by fisheries. This species is likely to be caught as bycatch to multispecies trawl fisheries which operate on much of the continental shelf and slope, coinciding with this species habitat. Based on anecdotal and trawl survey data, this species has undergone dramatic declines in abundance and substantial reductions in geographic range within the Mediterranean and the Northeast Atlantic, and it is listed in the Barcelona and Bern conventions.
<br/>
<br/>The data available indicate that <em>Rostroraja alba</em> was formerly captured frequently in the northwestern Mediterranean during the 1960s and off Tunisia and Morocco in the early to mid 1970s. It is now considered rare and is believed to have undergone a significant but currently unquantifiable decline in abundance and extent. This, in combination with the continued and potentially increasing threat from fisheries call for this species to be assessed as Endangered in the Mediterranean. Similar declines in geographical range have occurred in the Northeast Atlantic and anecdotal evidence suggests this species, including localized populations have declined severely e.g., in the Irish Sea. There is a high potential for population decline in the Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast, and in the Celtic Sea. The collapse of a directed long-line targeted fishery in Brittany highlights the incapacity for this species to withstand fisheries exploitation. The data presented here for the Northeast Atlantic indicate that this species is assessed as Critically Endangered. 
<br/>
<br/>On this basis, this species is globally assessed as Endangered, however this will need to be revisited once information from West and Sub-Equatorial African range of its distribution is available (specifically with data from South African trawl fisheries).","This is a benthic species of sandy and detrital bottoms from coastal waters to the upper slope region between about 40 to 400 m and exceptionally down to 500 m (Capape 1976, Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005). Du Buit 1974 reports this species to be more prevalent in rocky habitats.  Little is known of this species' life history and ecology. <br/> <br/>Estimates of size at maturity are 130 cm (males) and 120 cm (females) (Capape 1976).  Maximum recorded size is 200 cm, even if is common between 60 and 150 cm of total length (Bauchot 1987). Gestation period is 15 months and females produce between 55 to 156 ova per year, egg cases are 160 to 200 cm in length and 130 to 150 cm in width (Stehmann and Burkel 1984, Serena 2005). Age at maturity, longevity, size at birth, average reproductive age, reproductive periodicity, annual rate of population growth and natural mortality are all unknown for this skate.  <br/> <br/>The white skate feeds on all kinds of bottom dwelling animals (Stehmann and Burkel 1984), especially fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Bauchot 1987).","Northeast Atlantic: Rajids are an important component of demersal fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (Holden 1977) and <em>R. alba</em> would be landed and sold if caught. Targeted fisheries have existed in certain areas, though these fisheries ceased after localised depletion. It may still be taken as by-catch in demersal fisheries off the Iberian Peninsula. Anecdotal information suggests that this species, including localized populations, have declined severely. In 2002, the ICES Study Group on Elasmobranch Fishes was asked to comment on the status of white skate and  ""considered that there was a high probability of population decline, both in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast, and in the Celtic Seas. For example, there was a directed long-line fishery in Douarnanez (Brittany) in the 1960s that collapsed (white skate are no longer listed on French fishery statistics), and a similar decline is thought to have occurred in the Irish Sea"" (ICES 2002). As discussed in the population section, historical data (early 1900s) from English surveys suggest that they occurred in UK waters, though no recent records exist (Rogers and Ellis 2000). Their status further south is unclear, though they may be landed around the Iberian Peninsula (ICES 2006), accounting for about 0.3% of skate and ray landings in Portugal. It is also noted that this species may be confused with shagreen ray <em>Leucoraja fullonica</em> and sandy ray <em>L. circularis</em>, and improved market sampling is required to fully ascertain the status of this species in fisheries. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. (2000) also report this species to have undergone a decline and even disappearance from other shelf areas, notably the Irish Sea.   <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>:  <br/><em>R. alba</em> is captured as bycatch to the multi-species trawl fisheries operating within its range. Benthic trawl effort has increased both numerically and in technological terms in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean over the last 50 years.  <br/> <br/>As discussed in the population section, the historical occurrence of the white skate within the Gulf of Lions is unclear, however the change in characteristics of the fisheries operating in this area can provide an insight into the change in Mediterranean fishing effort over time. The Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low powered boats (total nominal horse power of 2,700 hp), since then effort increased to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp (between 1974 and 1987). Aldebert (1997) reported that half of the fishing effort within the Adriatic Sea to have been displaced to target small pelagic fish, however this Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croation, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). The large body size, slow growth, low fecundity and large size of juveniles of this species makes it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation when compared to other rajids (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes are likely to be taken in fishing nets, including the eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end, Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2003), as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean is approximately 20 mm.","Little information is available on the population size of the white skate.  The data does indicate that this species has undergone a reduction in abundance and is now considered rare in the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean.  <br/> <br/>Historically, within the Mediterranean this species was captured frequently off northern coasts of Tunisia in the mid-1970s and the coast of Morocco in the early 1970s (Capape 1976). It was described as being more or less frequent in the Northwestern Mediterranean (1965) and the French coast (1950 to 1960s) and Italian Seas (1972) (Capape 1976).  However, a time series of comparative trawl surveys running from 1957 to 1995 in the Gulf of Lions, in the Eastern basin of the Mediterranean failed to catch any white skate specimens. This consisted of eight separate surveys, conducted by four survey vessels. A total of 1,359 tows were carried out on shelf and slope areas extending from the coast to 800 m in depth (which includes the known depth range of this species) (Aldebert 1997).   <br/> <br/>In the eastern Mediterranean, it was captured in the Adriatic (1963) and the limit of its eastern distribution is Greece (Capape 1976). This species was regularly captured by fisheries in Tunisian waters and was common in all Tunisian coastal waters but captures were more frequent in the north part of the Tunisian coast (Capape 1976). This species is now rare along the Tunisian coast (Bradai 2000).   <br/> <br/>In the Adriatic Sea, comparative trawl surveys indicate that Rostroraja alba was present in 4% of hauls of the ""Hvar"" 1948 survey (based on 138 valid hauls in depths of up to 400 m). Since then, two time series of trawl surveys have occurred in the Adriatic Sea. The Italian national trawl survey National Group for Demersal Resource Evaluation (GRUND) began in 1982, and the MEDITS survey began in 1985, both surveys are still ongoing. <em>Rostroraja alba</em> was captured sporadically and infrequently in both of these surveys, typically in &lt;2.6% of hauls in any year. Of the GRUND surveys, it was captured in approximately 1.7% of hauls in the central, northern and southern Adriatic Sea (Marano <em>et al</em>. 2003).   <br/> <br/>In addition to the Adriatic Sea, the MEDITS survey actually operates on the north Mediterranean coast almost continuously from western Morocco and Spain in the west Mediterranean to the Aegean Sea in the eastern Mediterranean (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). Six trawl surveys are carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and the Eastern (Aegean Sea). A total of 6,336 tows were been performed between 1994 and 1999 in depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. This species was not recorded in the central and northern MEDITS surveys, but was captured in the southern MEDITS survey in 1998 and 1999, in 1.4% of the hauls. However, uncertainty exists as to the validity of the identification of this species. It is suspected that earlier surveys may have confused this species with Leucoraja circularis and or Dipturus oxyrhinchus (F. Tinti and N. Ungaro pers. comm. 2003). The white skate was recorded in only nine hauls in the western central area (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br/>  <br/>From other regions within the Mediterranean, only one specimen was caught with a bottom trawl net by a commercial vessel in Livorno (the Ligurian Sea) in 2003 (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2003). Also in the Northwestern Ionian sea, only a single individual of this species was reportedly caught in 1997 (Sion <em>et al</em>. 2003).   <br/> <br/>From the data presented it can be inferred that this species is now very rare and also the MEDITS survey suggests a substantial reduction in geographic range. In fact, this species was only recorded from the western area of this survey (Morocco, Spain, France). Evidence from the Gulf of Lions survey suggests its presence along French coast may be in doubt. As described above, Aldebert (1997) reported that the white skate was historically absent from the Gulf of Lions, however the MEDITS survey data casts doubt over the occurrence of this species across the length of the French coast. The current distribution of occurrence for this species represents a small fraction of its former range. From the former frequency of capture of this species in the western Mediterranean it can be inferred that this species has undergone a substantial but currently unquantifiable decline in abundance and extent.",Decreasing,"The overall geographical range of Rostroraja alba covers the Eastern Atlantic coasts from the southern British Isles south to South Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea, and extending into the southwestern parts of Indian Ocean. 
<br/>
<br/>This species is listed as occurring in the Northwestern European seas, however no valid records exist in northern areas of the Northeast Atlantic.  
<br/>The geographic range of this species is further discussed in the following section, with reference to its decrease in abundance coupled with a decrease in geographic range.",,Marine,"<strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong>:  <br/>There is a minimum landing size of 40 cm for skates and rays caught in the inshore waters of various parts of England and Wales, as implemented by Sea Fishery Committee bylaws. Though there are no species-specific management measures for this species, there is a total allowable catch (TAC) for skates and rays in the North Sea and adjacent waters, and they may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries (e.g., mesh size regulations, effort reduction). Given the low abundance of this species, species-specific management measures may also be warranted. <br/> <br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong>: <br/>For the conservation of chondrichthyans within the Mediterranean region, the FAO SAC Subcommittee on the Environment and Ecosystem recommended that all fishing states implement a Mediterranean Action Plan for the Management and Conservation of chondrichthyans, in line with IPOA sharks (International Plan of Action on the management and conservation of chondrichthyans). <br/> <br/>The MEDLEM project was adopted at the last SAC meeting (FAO, Rome 2005) for data collection within the Mediterranean basin on large elasmobranches.

12692964,63572,Pterapogon kauderni,Endangered,"B2ab(ii,iii,iv,v)",2007,2007-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Banggai Cardinalfish, <em>Pterapogon kauderni</em>, is a small reef fish endemic to the Banggai Islands off Sulawesi, Indonesia. This species is distinguished by having a relatively small population size, limited distribution (EOO about 5,500 km², AOO about 34 km² and it has two distinct geographic clades and one small subpopulation introduced accidentally to Sulawesi), plasticity and ontogenetic differences in microhabitat utilization, a social system based upon group living, territorial behavior in both males and females, paired courtship and spawning that is initiated by females, low fecundity, considerable investment in energy resources for reproduction, paternal oral incubation of eggs and free-living embryos, a lack of a pelagic larval phase, limited dispersal capability and localized settlement and recruitment. <br/> <br/><strong>Decline Rates</strong> <br/>Several subpopulations affected by the aquarium fishery exhibited dramatic declines between 2001 and 2004, among them: a complete extinction of a subpopulation was documented off Limbo Island in 2004. According to a 2001 census this subpopulation was composed of about 50,000 fish (densities = 0.02 fish/m²); and a small subpopulation off Bakakan Island that harbored 6,000 fish in 2001 was reduced to 17 individuals in 2004 (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The rate of decline for this species is difficult to calculate, since the earliest quantitative surveys (2001) were carried out several years after the harvest began within its natural geographic range. However, one subpopulation localized inside a bay in Southwest Banggai Island has been off limits to all fishing since before the beginning of the trade (the bay is privately owned by a pearl farm business). The bay has the typical habitats, microhabitats, and oceanographic characteristics in which <em>P. kauderni</em> is found throughout the Archipelago, and therefore this subpopulation may be used to estimate what the historical baseline abundance for this species could have been. The density of this subpopulation was 0.63 individuals/m²). <br/> <br/>This density is significantly higher than the mean density (0.07 individuals/m²) of the eight censuses completed in 2004 in unprotected sites [S = 0.05; highest d= 0.21 (Bokan); lowest d= 0.028 (Bangkulu)]. In addition, a census was carried out about 300 m from the protected bay and the density was 0.071 ind./m² (Lunn and Moreau 2004, Vagelli 2005).  If the 0.63 density value is considered as the historical normal density for this species within the Archipelago, then a reduction of approximately 89% took place since the start of the fishery (about 9 to 10 years before the 2004 censuses). <br/> <br/>However, at one of these sites (Masoni) the density increased from 0.03 to 0.06 individuals/m² between 2001 and 2004. This increase is thought to have occurred in response to a collecting ban that the local people imposed in early 2003. In another site (Bokan) a more significant increase was found in 2004, i.e., 0.21 individuals/m². In this case too, collection in the census site (which has an area of occupancy of only about 1 km²) was banned in 2002 by the village chief because of disputes with outside collectors (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The size class structure of populations found during the last survey (2004) within the natural range of <em>P. kauderni</em>, agree with those reported previously, where most fish encountered were large juveniles (6 to 9 months old), whereas newly released recruits (&lt;15 mm TL) are rare (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Thus, in 2004 of a total of 3,672 individuals censused, within the Archipelago, 1,364 (37.1%) were adults, 2,140 (58.3%) were older juveniles and 168 (4.6%) new recruits and small juveniles up to about 2 months of age (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/><strong>Assessment:</strong> <br/>The decline information is not sufficient to apply Criterion A and likewise Criteria C and D cannot be used because the population is too large. However, based on the very small area of occupancy (AOO), the severe fragmentation (see the documentation below) and the ongoing continuing decline (local extirpations and marked decrease in population size in recent years) due to exploitation for the international aquarium trade, this species is assessed as Endangered under Criterion B.","<strong>Habitat:</strong>
<br/>The Banggai Cardinalfish occurs primarily on shallow sheltered bays and harbors, mainly on silty reef flats with sandy bottoms and sea grass beds. Depth distribution is generally ranges between 0.5 and 6 m, but is most commonly found between 1.5 and 2.5 m. Some populations inhabit very clear waters in coral reef areas, while others inhabit still, murky bays, and some groups are found in sandy patches associates with anemones, and less commonly, in open habitats (low branching corals and rubble). This species inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs (51% of identified groups), seagrass beds (35%), and open areas of sand and rubble (14%). It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands; isolated populations also occur in areas affected by strong surge and moderate currents Water temperatures in these habitats range from 28°C to 33°C (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). There is an ontogenetic shift in habitat and microhabitat use between juveniles and adults that occurs within the same area and depth; all size classes, including mating pairs and brooding males, overlap in their distribution; the shift in use is not the consequence of differential feeding habitats nor intraspecific competition (Vagelli 2004a). The processes governing this ontogenetic shift are not clear. No pre-settlement factor is involved, however, because this species lacks a pelagic larval phase and embryos released by brooding males settle into parental habitat directly (Vagelli 1999, 2002, 2004a; Vagelli and Volpedo 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles associate with sea grasses, sea urchins, sea stars, sea anemones, soft corals and corals. Adults shelter between the spines of sea urchins but also among anemones, corals, stony hydrozoans, rocks and artificial structures such as jetties (Allen 2000, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2004a). Sea anemones utilized include <em>Actinodendron</em> sp., <em>Entacmaea quadricolor</em>,  <em>Heteractis crispa</em>, <em>Macrodactyla doreensis</em>, <em>Stichodactyla haddoni</em>, and <em>S. merteensis</em>. Corals include <em>Acropora</em> sp., <em>Anacropora</em> sp., <em>Echinopora horrida</em>, <em>Goniopora</em> sp.,  <em>Heliofungia actiniformis</em>, <em>Montipora digitata</em> and <em>Seriotopora hystrix</em>. Soft corals utilized include <em>Nephthea</em> sp. and stony hydrozoans include <em>Millepora</em> sp.  Sea urchin species utilized include <em>Diadema setosum</em> and <em>Tripneustes</em> sp., while the sea star is <em>Proteaster nodosus</em>. Banggai Cardinalfishes also associate with the submerged roots of mangroves (<em>Rhizophora</em> sp.). Census work showed that 43.7% of the groups were associated with hard corals, 31.9% with urchins <em>Diadema setosum</em>, and 24.4% with anemones (Allen 2000; Vagelli and Erdmann 2002; Vagelli 2004a, 2005).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Ecology:</strong>
<br/>When sheltering in anemones and <em>Heliofungia</em> corals, <em>P. kauderni</em> often associates with various species of anemone fishes (<em>Amphiprion</em>) and anemone shrimps (<em>Periclimenes</em>), and with several species of Apogonidae (<em>Apogon, Archamia, Cheilodipterus</em> and <em>Sphaeramia</em> when living among spines of sea urchins. In seagrass beds (predominantly composed of <em>Enhalus acoroides</em>), <em>P. kauderni</em> is associated with anemones, isolated live corals, sea urchins or sea stars forming small fish assemblages, commonly with <em>Abudefduf sexfasciatus</em> and several species of <em>Pomacentrus</em>, <em>Chromis</em> and <em>Halichoeres</em>.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Diet:</strong>
<br/>As opposed to other described apogonids, <em>P. kauderni</em> has diurnal trophic habits, and its feeding activity decreases with the day and ceases around sunset time. <em>P. kauderni</em> is a carnivore-planktivore that feeds principally upon copepods, but it is also a generalist opportunistic species that feed upon a variety of taxa, principally planktonic demersal and benthic organisms. Stomach content analysis found prey representing 29 taxa with a taxonomic level of suborder or higher belonging to 6 phyla: Rhyzopoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Chaetognatha, and Chordata. There were no significant differences in diet composition between size classes. Quantitative analysis showed that copepods make up about 79% of <em>P. kauderni</em> diet, and that other important components are decapods and isopods. There was an important variation in diet composition among the sites. Representative food items include ascidian larvae, chaetognaths, post-settled gastropod and bivalve juveniles, polychaetes, acarids, copepods, amphipods, stomatopods, cumaceans, isopods, euphausiids, ostracods, cirriped larvae, mysids, decapod larvae, tanaidaceans, and the larvae of teleost and chironomid insects (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Group Size:</strong>
<br/>Within its natural geographic range <em>P. kauderni</em> formed groups with a mean of 9.5 individuals, although the majority of them were composed of fewer individuals. Group size varied with age class, habitat and microhabitat. The mean size of the 448 censed groups (3,672 individuals) was 8.2 individuals, and the group means per site ranged from 3.9 to 19.8 individuals. Most groups (73% of all groups) were composed by few individuals (1 to 6). The largest single group found was about 500 individuals (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). 
<br/>
<br/><strong>Breeding Biology:</strong>
<br/>Banggai Cardinalfish pairs defend territories jointly and for three likely reasons: 1) spawning site defense (viewed as unlikely because spawning sites do not seem to be limiting), 2) partner defense (females defending brooding males), and 3) to avoid spawning attempts by ""sneaker male"" (Kolm and Berglund 2004). Contrary to predictions for a sex role-reversed species, and all other apogonids studied to date, males assume the role of the principal aggressor towards intruders in their territories prior to brooding (Kolm and Berglund 2004). For both males and females, however, territorial aggression is greater towards intruders of the same sex. In experimental introductions of larger male intruders into territories held by male-female pairs, the intruding male was unable to replace the resident male even though the resident female may have courted the intruder; as well, males never courted intruding females. Because this species may have roles that are sexually equivalent, male and females likely play different roles in the defense of jointly-held territories (Kolm and Berglund 2004).
<br/>
<br/>As with other cardinalfishes, the Banggai Cardinalfish is an obligate paternal mouthbrooder (Hayashi 1999). Reproductive behavior was filmed <em>in situ</em> by Dr. Masayoshi Hayashi (Yokusuka City Museum, Yokusuka, Kanagawa, Japan) and the film was broadcast on Japanese television in 1998. Other details on reproductive behavior were obtained from additional laboratory and field studies. Under laboratory conditions, <em>P. kauderni</em> reproduces throughout the year. Single females in captivity can reproduce once per month, whereas males mouth-brood up to six clutches per year. Females, under laboratory conditions can be reproductively active at about 9 months of age and 35 mm SL. The smallest female with signs of advance gonadal maturation found in the wild was 41 mm SL (Vagelli 1999, Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Females initiate courtship and use a variety of different behavioral patterns during courtship interactions (Vagelli 1999, Kolm 2001). Between a few days and up to two weeks prior to courtship and spawning, a pair will separate from the main group of fishes, establish a spawning site, and commence territorial behavior (Vagelli 1999, Kolm and Berglund 2004). A secondary male may be allowed into the territory and be courted by the female although this male did not interfere with courtship of the primary male (Vagelli 1999). Spawning and juvenile release (settlement) in the wild appears to follow a lunar cycle, with a major spawning peak during full moon and a second, smaller peak during the last quarter, although in one geographically-distinct population major spawning activity occurs during the last quarter  (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Courtship occurs during daylight hours and, in laboratory conditions, concludes by mid-afternoon. At the time of spawning and egg transfer, the female exudes an egg mass from her genital papilla that is pulled, fertilized, and then gulped by the male. <em>P. kauderni</em> possesses low fecundity, females produce small egg clutches of up to about 75 eggs of 2.5–3-mm in diameter. The mean clutch size found being incubated by males in the wild was 41 eggs (range=12 to 73) (Vagelli 1999, Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). The male broods an egg clutch for about 20 days; after hatching, the eleutheroembryos (free embryos) remain within the mouth cavity for another 10 days before release. Under laboratory conditions, a female would also court and even spawn with a secondary male (Vagelli 1999).  Following spawning and egg transfer, females defend the brooding male from intruders while males manipulate egg masses within their oral cavities; occasionally, intruders attempt to take eggs from a male’s mouth. The fertility rate under laboratory conditions is about 40 to 60%. Besides normal loss due unfertilized eggs and embryos that do not finish developing, an important percentage of eggs are lost during the clutch transfer (Vagelli 1999). Males do not feed while incubating the eggs; upon hatching some 20 days after spawning, the embryos are held an additional 10 days until their yolk is consumed.  Then, the juveniles, about 5.0 to 6.0 mm SL, are released from the male's oral cavity. A major settlement peak appears to occur during the full moon and a second minor peak during the new moon (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Vagelli (1999, 2004b) and Kolm (2001, 2002) provide laboratory studies of the reproductive biology and early ontogeny of this species, while Vagelli (2004a), Vagelli and Volpedo (2004) and Vagelli, 2005 provide data from field studies. Principal characteristics of the reproductive biology include: 1) parental care of an advanced degree, 2) an elevated level of energy investment per offspring, 3) low fecundity, 4) direct development, 5) a lengthy oral incubation period that includes the retention of free embryos after the eggs hatch, 6) settlement of juveniles within the habitat of their parents (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004).
<br/>
<br/>The sex ratio within groups is approximately equivalent (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Longevity in captivity can reach 4 to 5 years (although reproductive activity decreases substantially after 2 to 3 years). However, in the wild most adult specimens are significantly younger (about 2 years old or less). Growth studies in captivity and using wild specimens show <em>P. kauderni</em> follows von Bertalanffy equation L∞ = 69 ± 1.58 mm, k = 0.21 ± 0.016, t<sub>0</sub> = -0.72 ± 0.15 months (r²= 0.99). At 12 months of age <em>P. kauderni</em> reaches a SL of about 43.5mm (TL of 64.5mm), at 18 months 47mm (70 mm TL). The largest wild specimen encountered was about 58 mm SL (88.5 mm TL) (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007). 
<br/>
<br/><strong>Resilience:</strong>
<br/>This species has a relatively short life span (ca. 2.4 years), matures at an average of 0.8 years (FishBase 2004) and has a generation time of 1.5 years (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007); these are all indications of reasonably good resilience. Unfortunately, this species' small population size, limited distribution, low fecundity, great parental investment, and rate of extraction lower this species resilience with corresponding severe negative effects. The combination of a lack of planktonic dispersal and particular oceanographic characteristics of the Banggai region (deep channels and strong currents) has likely contributed to the extreme philopatry of this species. In addition, its within-parental habitat recruitment, sedentary nature, and shallow habitat preference preclude <em>P. kauderni</em> from dispersing even to nearby islands and have led it to a high degree of genetic structure (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004). <em>P. kauderni</em> is especially susceptible to indiscriminate collecting, e.g., its association with shallow microhabitats greatly facilitates its capture, while the lack of dispersal mechanisms make it almost impossible for this species to re-colonize areas where they have been depleted (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007).
<br/>
<br/>This species is highly prized in the aquarium trade and thus highly vulnerable to over-fishing, post-capture mortality, and habitat destruction.","<strong>Threats to the Habitat:</strong> <br/>Although resident in naturally-silty harbors and bays, this species might experience negative impacts from harbour dredging and associated pollution, as well as sediment from coastal development and use. <br/> <br/>Juveniles may be vulnerable to local population dynamics of anemones and sea urchins that provide mutualistic microhabitat. Threats to these might be from harvest (aquarium trade or food trade) or coral bleaching (anemones).  Adults may be vulnerable to local population dynamics of sea grasses. <br/> <br/><strong>Threats to the Species:</strong> <br/> <br/><u>Exploitation</u> <br/>The Banggai Cardinalfish is highly-prized in the aquarium trade (Allen 2000, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Kolm and Berglund 2003). It has been heavily exploited by the aquarium trade since its rediscovery in 1994. Despite claims that captive breeding has been successful, most aquarium specimens are still captured in the wild. Fishes are collected, mainly with nets, and held in floating nets until purchased by fish buyers who visit individual fishers at least 3 to 4 times a month. Collectors are paid a small sum (ca. US $0.01 to 0.025 in 2001) per fish by buyers who, in turn, sell to exporters for US $ 0.10 to 0.12 a fish (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Since 1999, the fishery has expanded from Banggai Island and Bandang Island to villages in the Bokan area, on Bangkulu Island, Labobo Island, and Peleng Island, with most collection occurring near their own villages. By 2001, at least 17 villages and 230 fishermen were involved in the <em>P. kauderni</em> trade (Lunn and Moreau 2004). An estimated minimum of 600,000 to 700,000 individuals were collected per year by local fishers prior to 2001 (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Lunn and Moreau 2002); current harvest rates are believed to exceed 700,000 to 900,000 fish/yr (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/><em>P. kauderni</em> are shipped primarily by boat from the Banggai Archipelago to national exporters via Tumbak and Manado and to a Bali exporter via Palu, and also direct to Bali exporters. An estimated 115,000 fish/month were transported on the Tumbak–Manado route, 3,000/month along the Palu to Bali route, and up to 10,000 fish/month were sent direct to Bali in 2001 (Lunn and Moreau 2004). These numbers are close to earlier estimates of 50,000 to 60,000 fish/month arriving in North Sulawesi for exportation, with total estimated trade for 2000 and 2001 of 700,000 fish (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Transhipment mortality is high because of lengthy travel times, usually 18 to 48 hours by boat (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002); no data on mortality from collecting or holding prior to transhipment appears to be available. The high mortality rate contributes to the disparity in prices paid to fishers and buyers (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). A minimum of four aquarium fish export companies operate in Bali; others exist in Kendary and Manado (Sulawesi).  he majority of <em>P. kauderni</em> captured in the Banggai Archipelago are destined for the international aquarium trade, with most exported to the United States, Europe and Asia. Wabnitz <em>et al</em>. (2003) and Lunn and Moreau (2004) further document the aquarium trade. <br/> <br/>In addition to the estimate of number of individuals collected and shipped reported in the assessment, trade surveys carried out by Lunn and Moreau (2004) suggest that a minimum of 118,000 Banggai Cardinalfish were sold each month by fishers in the Banggai Islands. Trade volumes are in all likelihood greater as this estimate only includes fish bought by Tumbak- and Palu-based buyers, not taking into consideration individuals collected and shipped from alternate locations, or lost to pre-sale mortalities in fishers’ holding cages (Lunn and Moreau 2004). <br/> <br/>A recent study showed that, despite the use of non-destructive fishing methods, the fishery had a negative effect on fish density when sites with high fishing pressure were compared to sites with low fishing levels (Kolm and Berglund 2003). Fishing also had a significant effect on group size (halving of average group size where sites with high and low fishing pressure were compared), which may lead to strong negative impacts on individual fitness in the future (referred to as the Allee effect in the scientific literature) (Stephens <em>et al</em>. 1999, Stephens and Sutherland 1999, Kolm and Berglund 2003). <br/> <br/>In addition to more detailed trade statistics to accurately reflect real trade volumes, regular monitoring of the fishery should be undertaken, particularly as studies seem to indicate that the expansion of the trade to new, previously unexploited areas is underway, moving outwards from Banggai Island to all of the major islands in the area. Lunn and Moreau (2003) also highlight that the pool of potential fishers could be large, particularly given that obstacles to entering the fishery appear to be minimal and alternative livelihood opportunities limited. <br/> <br/>Other Threats: <br/>This species is reportedly parasitised by four main parasite types. Three of them have been already identified, i.e., nematodes (6.6% of all individuals analyzed), digenetic trematodes (7.9%); and 4.8% of individuals were parasited by cestodes (plerocercoid larvae). The last type of parasites found consists of an undescribed isopod which was found encysted in the body cavity and on the external stomach wall of 7.2% of individuals analyzed. These endoparasites are currently being investigated and preliminary results indicate that they belong to a new family of epicaridean isopods with an unknown life cycle (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>Indirect evidence strongly suggests that the Crocodile-fish <em>Cymbacephalus beauforti</em> (Platycephalidae), several species of Lion-fish <em>Pterois</em> (Scorpaenidae) and the grouper <em>Epinephelus merra</em> (Serranidae) prey upon <em>P. kauderni</em>, particularly in areas inhabited by large groups. Other likely predators are the Stonefish <em>Synanceia horrida</em> (Scorpaenidae), several species of moray eels of the genus <em>Gymnothorax</em>, and <em>Echidna nebulosa</em> (Muraenidae) and the sea-snake <em>Laticauda colubrina</em> (Elapidae) (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The species is thought to suffer high mortality during the first days after settlement due to predation, including cannibalism (Vagelli 2002). For instance, despite that under laboratory conditions the average number of juveniles released was 40, and the average clutch size of brooding males in the wild was 18 embryos, out of 81 groups of new recruits found in the wild during 3 expeditions, most of them consisted of one or two individuals (mean: 2.3 individuals). The three largest groups found consisted of 15, 12, and nine individuals (Vagelli 2004a, Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>A newly emerging threat (a viral disease) has been documented in wild-harvested individuals maintained in captivity.  The origin of the iridovirus, as well as the prevalence in and impacts to wild populations, is currently under investigation (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007). <br/> <br/>Frequent earthquakes recently affected several zones within the Banggai Archipelago had a potential detrimental impact on localized <em>P. kauderni</em> subpopulations","The earliest known population survey (2001) identified <em>P. kauderni</em> on 16 out of 37 islands searched. Average densities in suitable habitat at three sites within the Banggai Archipelago were approximately 0.03 fishes per m² (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Based on these census data and calculations of the total available habitat, the species was estimated to have a total population size of 1.7 million fish (Vagelli 2002). Additional surveys in 2002 and 2004 covering the entire Archipelago (50 islands, 159 sites) expanded the range to 27 (17 major and 10 minor) islands. Surveys done in 2004 found <em>P. kauderni</em> in most sites at densities of about 200 to 700 individuals/ha. The mean density based on census carried out in seven locations throughout its natural range in 2004 was 0.07 individuals per m², with a total population size estimated at 2.4 million individuals (Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><em>P. kauderni</em> exhibits the highest degree of population structure that has been documented for a marine fish (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is a unique case of genetic isolation in populations separated by extremely short distances. Studies utilizing both mt DNA and micro-satellites have already indicated that populations occurring on reefs of the same islands, separated by only a few kilometers, are genetically isolated from one another (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004).  For instance, assignment tests performed in 23 subpopulations from all over the Archipelago, showed that 20 had a significant self-reassignment. When considering all the Bangkulu populations, 94% of the individuals from this island were reassigned back to the island - range 80.0% to 100% (Vagelli <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The lack of suitable habitats between subpopulations coupled with lack of dispersal mechanisms, are the most likely reasons for this isolation.
<br/>
<br/>Banggai Cardinalfish populations are distinguished for having two monophyletically-distinct clades: a southwestern clade restricted to the southwest of Bangkulu Island, and northern and eastern clades distributed throughout the remainder of its range (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004).  Eleven polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci have been isolated from male fishes; polymorphism ranges from 2 to 15 alleles and expected heterozygosities range from 0.107 to 0.928, thus allowing for genetic studies of this species with very high resolution (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Generation length is estimated at being 1.0 years (FishBase 2004), however more recent estimates place it at 1.5 years (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007).",Decreasing,"<em>Pterapogon kauderni</em> is a rare example of a marine fish with an extremely limited geographic range. It is endemic to the Banggai Archipelago, which lies in the Banggai-Sula platform in eastern Indonesia. The Banggai Island group is thought to have been a geological entity during the Cenozoic, and is located within the region of Wallacea. The natural geographic range of <em>P. kauderni</em> extends from 01° 24' 57.6"" of latitude South (Monsamat, east Peleng) as its northern most distribution point to 02° 0' 53.5"" of latitude South (Loisa A), and from 123° 34' 11"" of longitude East (Patipakaman, central Peleng) as its westernmost distribution to approximately 124° 23' 30"" of longitude East (Kano) and the south-east tip of Taliabu. This distribution covers an area of approximately 5,500 km². However, within this range, the maximum potential available habitat is about 426 km of coastline extending from the shore to about 100 m off the coast, with a maximum available area of about 34 km² (Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><em>P. kauderni</em> was found in 74 sites in 30 islands. Four sites were located in the Lembeh Strait (three islands and Sulawesi) in north Sulawesi, where this species was introduced in 2000, and in one site in central Sulawesi (Luwuk). The rest of sites were located within its natural distribution, i.e., the Banggai Archipelago. Here, it was found in 17 of the 20 major islands and in 10 of the 27 minor islands.
<br/>
<br/>The most isolated subpopulation inhabiting a large island was located in the eastern coast of Tempaus, which is separated from the subpopulation inhabiting Masoni Island by 16 km, and towards the west the closest subpopulation is found in south Bokan, at about 30 km. The second most isolated subpopulations inhabit Bangkulu Island, with its north subpopulation separated by about 13.6 km from south Peleng, and by about 13.5 km from Labobo Kenecil. Then, the subpopulation inhabiting Masoni Island is separated by about 11 km from the subpopulation located in Limbo, and by 16 km from that inhabiting Tempaus. Finally, the subpopulation found in Labobo is separated by about 10 km from the subpopulation located in Bangko and by 13.6 km from the closet subpopulation inhabiting Bangkulu. All other large islands are inhabited by at least one subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> that is separated by no more than (and frequently less) 5 km from another subpopulation inhabiting a different large island. Despite that oceanographic and physiographic conditions, as well as availability of habitats and substrates were similar to those found on big islands inhabited by <em>P. kauderni</em>, no populations of <em>P. kauderni</em> were found in the other 17 minor islands, reefs and atolls located far from the big islands. Furthermore, some of these small islands were separated by very short distances from big islands inhabited by <em>P. kauderni</em>. Thus, no subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> was found in Tanalan (localized at only 3.7 km  from the subpopulation inhabiting Masepe),  Belangan (at 2 km from the population of Bokan), Bongko (at 3.7 km  from the subpopulation of north Bangkulu), Sidula (at 5 km from the subpopulation inhabiting center-east Bangkulu), Togonglantan (separated by 5 km from the subpopulation of Bangkulu and by 6 km from that in habiting Labobo), nor in Tabija, which lays at only 1.5 km from the <em>P. kauderni</em> subpopulation inhabiting the bay localized south of  Keya on the nor-occidental coast of Taliabu.
<br/>
<br/>The Luwuk subpopulation, whose origin is not clear, is restricted to a very small area inside the harbor and is exposed to high levels of pollution and contaminants. Despite thorough searching from the harbour mouth to as far north as Botok (68 km), and as far south as Luk (46.5 km), no populations of <em>P. kauderni</em> were found outside the harbour, despite that environmental conditions and substrate availability were much better than those inside the harbor. The closest subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> to the one at Luwuk is located about 100 km southeast, in Patipakaman (Peleng Island).
<br/>
<br/>The Lembeh subpopulation is located about 400 km north of the natural range of <em>P. kauderni</em> natural range; it was first detected in the Lembeh Strait in September 2000 occupying an area of approximately 50 m along the coast of Sarina Kenecil Island. The establishment of this subpopulation is a consequence of accidental or intentional releases from an aquarium fish operation in the area. By November 2000 this subpopulation expanded to the ""Police Pier"" on the margin of Sulawesi, where by May 2001 about 650 individuals occupied an area of approximately 750 x 250 m. By April 2004, <em>P. kauderni</em> extended its range from the Police Pier to at least 200 m to the south, and at least 500 m to the north. In addition, it was found for the first time in Sarina Island, and in Lembeh Island, where it was introduced in 2002 (Erdmann and Vagelli 2001, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005).

<br/>See distribution map, and maps in the attached PDF.",,Marine,"Soon after the Banggai Cardinalfish appeared in the aquarium trade, a breeding programme was developed at the New Jersey State Aquarium (Vagelli 1999). But apparently no concerted effort within the aquarium trade has been made to replace wild-caught fish with captive-bred fish (Vagelli 2002, 2004b). As this fish can be reared through its entire life cycle in captivity (Vagelli 1999), it is strongly recommended that efforts be developed to raise this species in captivity and in the field (it is highly recommended that such efforts be undertaken in partnerships with local communities, preferably in Indonesia, to avoid removing livelihoods from the area). Such initiatives would reduce the need to capture wild specimens to supply the trade and reduce impact on existing populations in the region. <br/> <br/>In order to obtain reliable estimates of trade volumes for this and other marine ornamental species it is recommended that Indonesian government (and other governments) disaggregate the ‘aquarium fish’ category so that trade statistics can be obtained at least for marine versus freshwater species; and ideally by species. <br/> <br/>It is further recommended that a trade monitoring system be established through direct collaboration with exporters. Targeting and inputting trade volumes of the Banggai Cardinalfish into GMAD could help spearhead such a monitoring initiative and allow better estimates of traded numbers to be derived (Wabnitz <em>et al</em>. 2003). Moreover, collectors and traders should be encouraged to gain MAC certification for the Banggai Cardinalfish. <br/> <br/>Additional improvements in the sustainability of the current trade through directed training programmes on holding, packing and shipping, to reduce mortality rates of the species, are also recommended (Lunn and Moreau 2004). The development of environmental education material and programmes to promote public awareness are strongly encouraged and the potential implementation of marine protected areas should also be investigated (Lunn and Moreau 2004). <br/> <br/>In summary, conservation actions required for this species include the development, implementation, and effective enforcement of regulations designed to significantly reduce and regulate the collection and export of this species for the aquarium trade (a proposal to include this species in CITES Appendix II was withdrawn (CoP 14 Prop. 19 ); and to protect and conserve critical habitat. Management actions that would benefit both this species and the fisher communities that harvest it at present could include artificial propagation at the local level with the intention of substituting completely captive-bred fish for wild-caught fish. In addition, a concerted and effective effort should be made to reduce post-capture mortality at all levels of the collection, marketing, and export chain.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Senegalese Hake are caught by trawlers targeting   this species, as well as by smaller longliners and gillnetters. It is   also captured as a bycatch of fisheries targeting cephalopods and   shrimp. The Eastern Central Atlantic fishery began at the beginning   of the 20th century, with sailing trawlers from southern Spanish   coast exploiting north African fishing grounds. This fleet gradually   became motorized, vessels become larger, and their fishing range extended   further south (Mauritania and Senegal). By the end of the 1960s,   Portuguese, Polish and USSR fleets, amongst others, were exploiting the   resource, and they continued to do so, using large trawlers of up to   2,000 tonnes, until the 1970s. After the economic exclusion zone (EEZ) declaration, and in 1986 with   the fishing agreement between Morocco and the European Union, European   fleets were gradually reduced in the Moroccan EEZ.

During the summer, when the water temperature strongly increases off Senegal, they move northwards, concentrating in the Mauritanian fishing area.

As it overlaps in distribution with <em>M. polli</em> at intermediate depths, the two species are often caught together and the catch statistics are reported in combined form (Fernandez-Peralta&#160;<em>et al. </em>2011). This kind of non-differentiation in catch statistics could lead to the possible exploitation of one species over the other. This species is taken by bottom trawls in offshore grounds off Mauritania and Senegal together with two other hakes (<em>M. merluccius </em>and<em> M. polli</em>). Most common fishing techniques are ""demersal bottom trawling"" and ""Hake trawling"". <br/><br/>Senegalese Hake under 40 cm in length are caught by trawlers targeting this species, as well as by smaller longliners and gillnetters. It is also captured as a bycatch of fisheries targeting cephalopods and shrimp. The Eastern Central Atlantic (ECA) fishery began at the beginning of the 20th century, with sailing trawlers from southern Spanish coast exploiting north African fishing grounds. This fleet gradually became motorized, vessels become larger, and their fishing range extended further south (Mauritania and Senegal). By the end of the 1960s, Portuguese, Polish and USSR fleets, amongst others, were exploiting the resource, and they continued to do so, using large trawlers of up to 2,000 FRT, until the 1970s. After the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) declaration, and in 1986 with the fishing agreement between Morocco and the European Union, European fleets were gradually reduced in the Moroccan EEZ. By 2000 only local fleets exploited the area. Eastern Central Atlantic catches also include Benguela Hake (<em>M. polli</em>), owing to overlapping of fisheries and identification problems. Catches reported to FAO show a peak period between 1973 and 1977 with around 100,000 tonnes annually resulting from USSR-fleet activity and to a lesser extent, Spanish fleets.

Its estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is 479 km², which meets the threshold for Endangered under criterion B2. Species-specific data on population, life history, and reproductive data are limited in part due to the difficulty in sampling for cryptic fishes. There has been an 8% decline in coral cover over a period of 41 years off San Blas and an overall 59% decline during the same time period throughout the remainder of the Caribbean. Assuming that this limited-range species is found in less than five locations with an AOO of less than 500 km² where its habitat is declining consistently throughout its range, it is therefore listed as Endangered (EN B2ab(iii)).<br/></p>","<em>Ogilbichthys ferocis</em> is a viviparous, shallow-water species with a maximum size of 2.9 cm standard length (SL) and hides in coral reef (Moller <em>et al</em>. 2004, Garrido-Linares and Acero 2006). This small, cryptic species likely exhibits high site fidelity where it hides in crevices, exhibits negative behaviour towards light, and is assumed to be more active at night (Crozier 1921, Suarez 1975, Smith-Vaniz <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Due to its cryptic nature, this species is normally only collected via rotenone sampling, therefore, knowledge of its behaviours and feeding habits are limited (Smith-Vaniz et al. 2006).

Unfortunately, data on these species, which include the reef-dwelling bythitids, are relatively limited. Between 1970-2011 (41 years), an overall 59% decline in coral cover was directly observed in the Caribbean, which was caused by anthropogenic stressors, <em>Diadema antillarum</em> decline, and coral disease. Specifically, there was an 8% decline during the same time period off San Blas, Panama and data are not available for the Colombian section of its range (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). We do not know how this species responds to these stressors or if it survives well on disturbed coral reefs.</p><p>It may be threatened by the invasive Lionfish (<em>Pterois volitans</em>), which consumes a variety of prey items at a high rate of efficiency, including fish and invertebrates (Morris and Akins 2009, Albins and Hixon 2008). Given the diet of these Lionfishes, small species such as this could be included as prey items. At present, there is no direct evidence that lionfish are a major threat to this species and no <em>Bythitidae</em> spp. have been recorded in the diet to date. Lionfish actively feed at night and coralbrotulas are thought to be active at night, so this is suspected to be a threat, but further research is needed.<br/></p><p></p>","<p>Due to the cryptic nature of <em>Ogilbichthys ferocis</em>, its presence is underestimated in routine visual reef fish surveys conducted by divers and is normally only collected via rotenone sampling, therefore, population data are limited (Ackerman and Bellwood 2000, Smith-Vaniz <em>et al</em>. 2006).

It appears rare in the northern basin but is locally abundant around the Balearic Islands and Tunisia. It occurs in coastal waters to 300 m depth, more commonly found at &lt;40 m depth in some areas such as the Balearic Islands. Records from Portugal and the northern coasts of Morocco require verification and may be misidentifications of other <em>Raja</em> species (skates). The Rough Skate is commonly taken as bycatch of demersal trawl, gillnet, trammel net, bottom longline, and purse seine fisheries, although no species-specific catch data are available. Given that it i) appears to be restricted to the Mediterranean Sea where it has recently declined in certain regions, and ii) ongoing relatively intense fishing pressure overlaps with parts of its range, the Rough Skate is assessed as Endangered under Criterion A4b.

Females mature at 34 cm disc width (DW) and males at 30 cm DW in the Mediterranean Sea (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 1987, Serena <em>et al</em>. 2010). Maximum body size is ~70 cm total length (TL) (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 1987, Serena <em>et al</em>. 2010). Most captured specimens off the Balearic Islands measure about 30–50 cm TL (Morey <em>et al</em>. 2009).</span></p> <p><span class=""s1"">From the Gulf of Gabès, length at maturity is reportedly 47.05 cm TL for males and 56.48 cm TL for females (Kadri <em>et al</em>. 2013). The age at 50% maturity was estimated to be 4.47 and 5.89 years for males and females, respectively. Maximum age and length were 12 years and 80 cm TL for females, and nine years and 65 cm TL for males. The generation length of this species is therefore estimated to be&#160;about nine years.</p>","<p><span class=""s1"">This species is taken as bycatch of demersal trawl, gillnet, trammel net, bottom longline, and purse seine fisheries. There is a high level of exploitation over the continental shelf and upper slope in the Mediterranean Sea (Aldebert 1997, Massutí and Moranta 2003). In some areas such as the Balearic Islands this skate is more common in shallow waters where it is taken in: trammel net fisheries targeting Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis</em>) and teleosts (bony fish); gillnet fisheries targeting Lobster (<em>Palinurus elephas</em>) and Red Mullet (<em>Mullus surmuletus</em>); and bottom longline fisheries targeting Grouper (<em>Epinephelus</em> <em>spp</em>.) and Sparidae (Morey <em>et al.</em> 2006). Trawl fisheries targeting Red Mullet, Picarel (<em>Spicara smaris</em>) and Small Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) on the upper shelf also overlap with parts of the Rough Skate's range. In Tunisian waters (mainly in the Gulf of Gabès),<em> </em>this species is taken as bycatch by trawlers at depths of 20−50 m and by gillnets at depths of &lt;20 m (Echwikhi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kadri <em>et al</em>. 2013). Females outnumbered males in sampled catches in gillnets; 80% of the females and 57% of the males were mature (Echwikhi <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p> <p><span class=""s1"">In a multigear small-scale fishery (mainly trammel net, gillnet, and bottom longline), the Rough Skate made up 12% in abundance of the elasmobranch capture at four to 160 m depth between 1998 and 2008 (Mallol <em>et al</em>. 2009). Trammel nets are the most likely gear to catch this species (Morey <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2009).</span></p> <p><span class=""s1"">Species-specific data are not usually available because landings of skates are grouped as “rays” or “skates”. Despite this, a monitoring program conducted at the Palma de Mallorca landing site showed that this species was the sixth most marketed elasmobranch on the island, at an estimated biomass of 6.3 tonnes in 2009. With 66.5% of this biomass coming from bottom trawlers and only 33.5% coming from small-scale fisheries (Morey and Navarro 2010), commercial fisheries appear to be a more significant threat in this region.</p>","<p><span class=""s1"">Trawl surveys have recorded this species in the Mediterranean Sea in low numbers, although it may be more common in unsampled shallow waters (&lt;40 m depth). The International Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) in the northern Mediterranean Sea captured the Rough Skate in 21 of 6,336 tows between 1994 and 1999 at 50–800 m depth (Baino <em>et al</em>. 2001). In the Gulf of Lion, trawl surveys conducted from the coast to 800 m depth in 1957–60, 1980–84, 1992–95 only captured this species on the shelf and slope during the period 1980–84 (Aldebert 1997).&#160;In surveys conducted in Italian waters, it occurred in 3.31% of 9,281 hauls performed between 1985 and 1998 at zero to 800 m depth, which were all from Sardinian and Sicilian waters (Relini <em>et al.</em> 2000).

It has an estimated generation length of 16 years. It is highly-valued by both commercial and recreational fishers. Long-lived, slow-growing species such as this tend to be particularly susceptible to overfishing, even with low fishing intensity or inefficient fishing methods. This species has been overfished in previous years and has undergone a 20 to 25 year cycle of increased and decreasing catches.<br/><br/>The main fishery and centre of abundance occurs almost exclusively in U.S. waters and is managed as three separate units: the Mid-Atlantic, the South Atlantic, and the Gulf of Mexico. The Mid-Atlantic was declared overfished in 1998, but is now considered rebuilt; the South Atlantic is not considered overfished; and despite declines in abundance since the 1980s, the Gulf of Mexico stock is also not considered overfished. However, it should be noted that the stock assessments for this species are generally data-poor, and as a result, contain a considerable amount of uncertainty. Biomass estimates show an increasing trend over at least the past decade in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic; however, the species has been declining since 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico. Combined weighted spawning stock biomass for all three areas declined by 66% over the past three generations (48 years). Each stock is strictly regulated and monitored under U.S. federal law. The cause of this population decline is understood and reversible; however, is not considered to have ceased due to the declining trend in biomass in its exploited population in the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, this species is globally listed as Endangered under criterion A2bd.<strong><br/></strong>","This bottom dwelling species occurs mostly on silt-clay substrate and is more common where there is suitable substrate for burrow construction, such as scour depressions around boulders or rubble piles; also often near submarine canyons (Valentine <em>et al</em>. 1980, Able <em>et al</em>. 1982, Low and Ulrich 1983, Grossman <em>et al</em>. 1985). It prefers temperatures of 8­°C to 17°C. Off the coast of New England, USA, it is restricted to the normally warm-water, upper continental shelf/slope and has suffered mass mortality in the past due to intrusion by cold Subarctic water. Such changes in water temperature also affects its reproductive success (Fisher et al. 2014). Adults usually live in groups and feed on shrimps, crabs, fish, squid, bivalves and holothurians (Steimle <em>et al</em>. 1999, Dooley 2002). Its main predator is goosefish (Steimle <em>et al</em>. 1999, NOAA Tech Memo NMFS-NE-152).<br/><br/>This is the largest species of tilefish; it can reach 110 cm standard length, 125 cm total length (24.9 kg), and is commonly found to 60 cm (5-7 kg). This species grows slowly and is suspected to be a protogynous hermaphrodite. Males are larger than females. The otoliths of this species are considerably difficult to age (SEDAR4 2004). According to a study conducted in the Mid-Atlantic/New England region, females can live up to 46 years and males to 39 years (Turner 1986). SEDAR25 (2011) agreed upon a maximum age of 40 years according to a study conducted by Palmer <em>et al</em>. (2004) in the southeastern Atlantic. A recent study concluded that the longevity of this species off Florida in the Atlantic is estimated at 26 years using a lead-radium dating technique (Lombardi-Carlson and Andrews 2015). Size and age at 50% maturity is 344 mm total length (TL) at age two (SEDAR 2011). Females mature between five to seven years of age at a fork length (FL) of 50 cm and can release between 2-8 million eggs per spawning event. Males generally mature at about five years and 50 cm FL; however, some males delay participation in spawning. Virtually all males develop ripe testes by six to seven years of age and 65 cm to 70 cm FL (Grimes and Turner 1999). Spawning in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic occurs between March to November and in the Gulf of Mexico from January to June.<br/><strong><br/>Generation length = Age of first reproduction + (z * Length of the reproductive period</strong>) (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Length of the reproductive period = Longevity - Age of first reproduction; z = 0.5; Longevity = 26 years; Age of first reproduction= (5+7)/2 = 6 years. Therefore, generation length = 16 years [6+(0.5*(26-6))].<br/><br/>According to SEDAR4 (2004), the female generation time was estimated to be 23.6 years, while SEDAR25 (2011) reported it as 20 years. We used the generation length of 16 years based on new data on longevity using improved ageing methodology (Lombardi-Carlson and Andrews 2015), which were not available for earlier SEDAR reports.","This species is long-lived and does not range far from the nest/pueblo it builds; these characteristics along with the fact this species is highly valued by commercial and recreational fishers, makes it highly susceptible to overexploitation and rapid population declines.&#160;There is a clear 20 to 25 year cycle of increasing and declining catches of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps,</span>&#160;which is most likely a result of overfishing (Grimes and Turner 1999).&#160;Fish are harvested well before their size of first maturity, which decreases the chance for successful recruitment (Hightower and Grossman 1989).","<strong><em>Canada/U.S. Atlantic</em></strong><br/>The U.S. and Canadian tilefish fishery began in 1879 and collapsed shortly thereafter with a mass mortality event caused by cold water intrusion in 1882 (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2014). It began to recover in the late 1890s with an abundance of young fish (Bumpus 1899), and by 1915 the species was again being fished. The reported fishery landings have been highly variable, with peaks in 1914-1915, the late 1920s, mid-1950s, and mid-1970s (Freeman and Turner 1977) and low but relatively stable since 1984 (Shepherd 1998). Shepherd (1998) notes low landings and a significant decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) of the north stock since about 1981 as evidence of over-exploitation. Turner (1986) reported that the effects of fishing have been drastic and stock size has been reduced by half to two-thirds, a level that continued into the mid-1990s (Shepherd 1998). High fishing mortality has truncated the size structure of the population; fewer larger fish greater than 70 cm have been landed (Grimes <em>et al</em>. 1980, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1983). The resurgence of this offshore fishery in the early 1970s partly as a recreational fishery may be a response to the decline of inshore fisheries because of habitat degradation and overfishing (McHugh 1977). However, a recent study found that changes in water temperature off New England due to anomalous cold water intrusions in the 1970s likely decreased survivability and overall reproductive success. This environmental stress combined with increased exploitation contributed to the significant population declines during this period (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2014). Barans and Stender (1993) reported similar declines in stock size and mean individual size as the South Atlantic Bight fishery developed, and harvests have also declined since the late 1980s (Parker and Mays 1998).<br/><br/>Hightower and Grossman (1989) determined fishing mortality of the southeast U.S. population to range from 0.10 (M - 0.10) to 0.48 (M = 0.25) which results in sustainable yields of 40 (M - 0.10) to 82 t (M = 0.25) per year. They obtained higher estimates of virgin population density (883-1,710 per km²) when research CPUE data were used and determined sustained yield estimates also were higher, ranging from 55 (M - 0.10) to 148 t (M = 0.25) per year. Observed yields in the developing fishery exceeded 100 t in 1981-1984 and in 1986; however, current observations indicate that fishing effort has declined to a low level in response to reduced catches. They recommend that the annual harvest not exceed about 50 t, which should result in a stock biomass of about 400 t to 800 t.<br/><br/>According to the Mid-Atlantic (<a href=""http://nefsc.noaa.gov/publications/crd/crd1404/partb.pdf"">SARC58 2014</a>) stock assessment, predicted total spawning stock biomass declined by 76% over the past 42 years (1971-2012; Table B26 page 416). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series. According to the South Atlantic (<a href=""http://sedarweb.org/docs/sar/SEDAR25_TilefishSAR.pdf"">SEDAR25 2011</a>) stock assessment, predicted spawning stock biomass declined by 50% over the past 47 years (1962-2010; Table 5.3 page 24). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series. Point estimates from the base model indicate that the U.S. southeast stock of <em>Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps</em> is currently not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, the estimated time series of F/FMSY calculated by SEDAR suggests that the populations had been overfished during the assessment period (SEDAR25 2011). Hightower and Grossman (1988) determined adult population density prior to fishing ranged from 603 to 950 per km² and stock biomass ranged from 1,130 to 1,570 tonnes (t). They obtained higher estimates of virgin population density (883-1,710 per km²) when research CPUE data were used. Although total landings vary greatly, CPUE data showed continuous decline prior to 1999 in the mid-Atlantic. Although total landings vary greatly, CPUE data show continuous decline. Steimle <em>et al</em>. (1999) report declines in CPUE (Georges Bank - Middle Atlantic) from 1970 to 1995 from over 6 mt/day to 1 mt/day, which represents an approximate decline of 78% over 24 years and represents an average decline in CPUE of 3.25% per year. Future declines in CPUE are probable.&#160; <br/><br/><em><strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong></em><br/>Total biomass and spawning biomass in the eastern Gulf of Mexico declined steadily beginning in the early 1980s; in the western Gulf of Mexico it declined until 1990, then increased from 1996 to 2000 and remain relatively constant from 2000 onward (<a href=""http://sedarweb.org/docs/sar/tilefish_SAR_FINAL.pdf"">SEDAR22 2011</a>). Mean age of females in 1965 was 6 years, declined to 2 years in 1997, and increased to a mean age of 4 years in 2009. According to the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR22 2011) stock assessment, predicted spawning stock biomass declined by 41% and total biomass by 68% over the past 45 years (1965-2009; Table 3 page 32). This decline was calculated by taking the endpoints of the time series generated using the SS3 central realization/SS run 1. The SS3 Central/SS run 1 realization stood out to the SEDAR22 working group as the most pragmatic choice to visualized trends abundance, biomass and exploitation of this species. The following information reflects this choice, however the working group recognized that this is only one of many equally plausible runs (SEDAR22 2011). It was concluded that overfishing of the Gulf of Mexico tilefish stock was not occurring and the stock was not overfished in 2009 (SEDAR22 2011).<br/>Wide geographic separation and evidence of limited movements may necessitate management as separate south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stocks. For this reason, it is assumed that there is little emigration or immigration of this species in or out of the Gulf. The majority of its population in the Gulf of Mexico may be present in the northern Gulf of Mexico, as this species is mostly associated with compacted mud habitat. Given its habitat preference, we estimate that at least 70% of its Gulf of Mexico population occurs in the northern Gulf in U.S. waters. In Mexico, all tilefishes are recorded in mixed catches of either Blanquillo camelo or Conejo Amarillo and there are no species-specific statistics collected. It may be known as Corvinato. There are no specific management measures for tilefishes in Mexico. They are not very common in markets, and may be seasonal catches. This species also occurs as by-catch in the Mexican Red Grouper fishery.<br/><br/><em><strong>Global</strong></em><br/>Biomass estimates show an increasing trend over at least the past decade for the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic stocks, however, it has been declining since 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico. Population declines estimated from the spawning stock biomass in the three assessment areas (Mid-Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic) were weighted based on the proportion of recruits occurring in each area in 1971 (the earliest year of available data for the Mid Atlantic). The proportion of recruits was estimated to be 64% in the Mid-Atlantic, 26% in the South Atlantic, and 10% in the Gulf of Mexico. Percent declines were estimated using the endpoints of the available data and resulted in different starting and ending years for each area (Mid-Atlantic: 41 years; Gulf of Mexico: 44 years; South Atlantic: 48 years). Based on the shape of the time series of spawning stock biomass, we suspect that these endpoints are a reasonable representation of the state of the population now and three generation lengths ago. Therefore, the weighted overall spawning stock biomass decline of 66% was assumed to have occurred over the past three generations (48 years).",Decreasing,"<em>Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps</em> is distributed in the western Atlantic Ocean from Nova Scotia (Canada) south along the U.S., in the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Keys, Tampa (Florida) to the Texas/Mexico border, and off Mexico from Tabasco to the Yucatan Peninsula, and along South America from the Gulf of Cariaco (Venezuela) to Suriname (R.

Conservation measures that effectively reduced catch by one-third were implemented in 2007 in order to recover South Atlantic populations that were overfished since the 1980s. In the Gulf of Mexico, tilefishes were added to the Fishery Management Plan for the reef fish fishery with the passing of Amendment 1 in 1990, under the authority of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Management is not species-specific.&#160;The tilefish fishery off the&#160;eastern&#160;United States (which covers multiple species) was originally an open-access fishery, however, a Fishery Management Plan was put in place on 1 November 2001 which applies to Virginia/North Carolina.&#160;Tilefish south of North Carolina are managed under the Southern Atlantic Fishery Management Council's FMP for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery. The key measures taken by the Fishery Management Plan included a 10-year stock rebuilding schedule; a commercial quota divided into full-time, part-time and incidental categories; a trip limit for the incidental category; and limited entry for the full-time and part-time categories. The tilefish FMP became experimental as it did not expect cooperation nor was there a consequence for lack of cooperation.&#160;The FMP originally qualified 51 vessels for tilefish fishing, however, this number has gradually declined to 30 vessels. An annual Total Allowable Landings quota was established as well as a limited access program which established three permit categories (Rountree&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008).

It feeds mainly on echinoderms (sea urchins), crustaceans and fishes, molluscs, tunicates, sponges, polychaetes and other worms. It may play an important role in regulating sea urchin populations which contribute to overgrazing of seagrasses (Kinds 2011). Its maximum length is 65 cm. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite with sex transition occurring between five and six years of age (Carpenter and Allen 1989). Its estimated natural mortality is 0.304, longevity is at least 27 years and it experiences relatively rapid growth in the early life stages (Grandcourt 2002). In Sudan, age at first maturity for females was estimated to occur at about 30 cm total length and two to three years of age and males at 33.5 cm and three to four years (Degoon and Ali 2013). When applying an age at first reproduction of three years and longevity of 27 years, its estimated generation length is 15 years.","Fishing is a major threat in parts of its range. In Kenya, the high rate of capture of juveniles of this species by the artisanal fishery, increasing fishing effort and inadequate protection causes over-exploitation (Samoilys <em>et al.</em> 2017).

The length at first capture was 9.6 cm, while the length at maturity was 20.14 cm (Mangi and Roberts 2006). Individuals ranging in size from 14.3 to 27.4 cm were landed in African basket traps in a heavily-fished Kenyan coral reef lagoon dominated by sand, seagrass and coral reef (Mbaru and McClanahan 2013).

These areas  are subject to a range of anthropogenic impacts, including coastal  development, pollution, destructive boat anchoring, and sedimentation. </span>Recently, there have been documented population declines at several locations across this species' range, primarily as a result of loss of important marine habitats such as soft corals and sponges. <span style=""""><span style=""""></span>The population declines observed in two of the largest known concentrations of the species over one 6-year study (2009-2015) are reported as over 90% with some fluctuation. Population trends varied in other areas, ranging from stability to declines of 40%. These observed declines are corroborated by anecdotal evidence from other areas and by the ongoing observed decline in several important habitats. Although the numbers in several sites indicate that the species may reach thresholds for a Critically Endangered listing, subpopulations are stable in several marine reserves and the species is not likely declining as quickly in less populated parts of its range. It is suspected that across the species' range, declines of 50-70% have occurred in the past three generations (&lt;10 years). Therefore, <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> is listed as Endangered under criterion A2bc.</span>","<em>Hippocampus whitei</em> is known to occur at depths to 12 m and is found utilising a wide range of habitat types including seagrasses, macroalgae, corals, sponges, and anthropogenic structures (Kuiter 2009, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Port Stephens, it has been shown that juveniles prefer gorgonian habitats (<em>Euplexaura </em>sp.) whilst adults had a preference for both sponges and soft coral (<em>Dendronephthya australis</em>) habitats. They were also found occurring in <em>Posidonia </em>seagrass and juveniles also used <em>Sargassum </em>sp. and soft coral habitats (<em>Carijoa </em>sp. and <em>D. australis</em>) (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014a). They are known to show a preference for more complex habitats, as it is believed that this provides better protection and more food resources (Hellyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Burchmore <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported that the species consumes amphipods, but did not elaborate. Most seahorses feed on a variety of small crustaceans, including harpacticoid, caprellid, and cyclopoid copepods, gammarid amphipods, caridean shrimp, and mysids (Woods 2002, Kendrick and Hyndes 2005, Kitsos <em>et al</em>. 2008, Yip <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>As is the case for other seahorses, <em>Hippocampus whitei </em>are ovoviviparous, and males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). They breed from October to April. Within this breeding season, they are site-faithful to a home range (averaging 8 m² for males, 12 m² for females: Vincent et al. 2005) and are faithful to a single mate (Vincent and Sadler 1995).<br/><br/>The species is known to display strong site fidelity with tagged males occurring on the same site for up to 56 months and females 49 months, whilst no seahorses were ever recorded moving between sites. The species is known not to move far, as the largest distance a tagged animal was found to travel was only 70 m. It has also been shown that individuals show strong fidelity to holdfasts such as sponges, with some individuals being recorded on the same holdfast for up to 17 months (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Within Sydney Harbour, seahorses are generally found on artificial habitats such as the protective swimming net enclosures and also on jetty pylons. Their use of these artificial habitats is most likely driven by a loss of natural habitats (such as seagrass, sponges and soft corals) within Sydney Harbour. Seagrass habitats within Sydney Harbour have been shown to decline (West <em>et al</em>. 2004) and anecdotal information suggests large declines in available soft coral and sponge habitats.<br/><br/>Growth parameters for Port Stephens were: females L∞ = 149.2 mm and K= 2.034 per year and males L∞ = 147.9 mm and K=2.520 per year compared to estimates from Sydney Harbour:&#160; females L∞ = 139.8 mm and K= 1.285 per year and males L∞ = 141.6 mm and K=1.223 per year (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><em>Hippocampus whitei </em>displays rapid growth, early maturity and reproduction (Harasti et al. 2012), indicating that it has the ability to develop large populations if conditions are appropriate, such as the availability of suitable habitat and few predators (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014b). However, the species has very limited chance for dispersal given that there is no pelagic stage for juveniles, with newborns generally settling in the area of birth and not travelling far (Harasti et al. 2014a). Even though the life-history parameters of <em>H. whitei</em> suggest it may be reasonably resilient, precaution should be taken in its future management as a result of its limited geographical distribution and increasing pressures from anthropogenic sources on its habitats.<br/><br/>Although generation length is unknown, the species is thought to be similar to other seahorses in having a generation length of approximately one year. Therefore declines are assessed over a 10-year period for this species, which is thought to be longer than three generation lengths.<em><br/></em>","<span style="""">The major threat to <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> is loss of essential marine habitats across its range. This species is known to occur along some of the most heavily populated and impacted estuaries in Australia (NSW EPA 2012). As the species displays strong site fidelity and has specific habitat preferences (Vincent <em>et al.</em> 2005, Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2014a), the further loss of key habitats through anthropogenic effects would result in a negative effect on species abundance and distribution; as occurred in Port Stephens (Harasti 2016). Whilst the Port Stephens estuary was previously considered a ‘stronghold’ for populations of <em>H. whitei</em>, the recent population declines as a result of habitat loss indicates that its long-term conservation within the Port Stephens waterway is at risk if essential marine habitats continue to be lost.<br/><br/>Within Sydney Harbour, it has been shown that <em>H. whitei</em> are very susceptible to councils cleaning the nets as removal of epibiota caused a decrease in abundance and that the species showed significant avoidance of areas devoid of epibiotic growth (Harasti <em>et al</em>. 2010). Guidelines for cleaning of the nets to minimise harm to the seahorses were developed and provided to councils in 2009 (Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2010); however, councils rarely implement these guidelines.</span><span style=""""><em><br/></em></span>","Information is available on population status for <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> from two estuaries where this species was found to be most abundant: Port Stephens and Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) (Harasti <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Resurveys of population abundance at both Port Stephens and Sydney Harbour have found declines in population abundance over the past decade.<br/><br/>Initial population declines were first noticed between 2010 and 2013 (Harasti 2014) in Port Stephens. Populations at the two largest known aggregation sites (the Pipeline and Seahorse Gardens, both in Port Stephens) were found to decline in abundance from 2006 to 2015. The Seahorse Gardens had a population estimate of ~370 (95% CIs: 239-612) mature animals in 2009, whilst resurveys of the site in 2015 provided a population abundance of only 10 animals (95% CIs: 10-12; or a<span style=""""> 98% decline over if extrapolated over 10 years, Harasti 2016). Similarly, the Pipeline site was found to experience a large decline with initial estimates indicating a population abundance of ~260 animals in 2009, compared to only 45 animals in 2015 (a 95% decline if extrapolated over 10 years</span>). Both locations saw some year-to-year fluctuations. The population abundance decline in Port Stephens was correlated with significant declines in the preferred habitats of seahorses. Both soft coral and sponge habitats were found to significantly decline at both these sites from 2009 to 2015 (Harasti 2016). Populations of <em>H. whitei </em>were relatively stable at two other sites in the region.<br/><br/>Populations in Sydney Harbour were also found to decline at the one location where population abundance had been collected. The protective swimming enclosure in Manly Harbour (referred to as Manly Net) was initially surveyed for <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> in 2007-2008 as part of a study assessing the impacts of council net cleaning on seahorse populations (Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2010). The adult population size on the Manly net from May 2007 to February 2008 was estimated at 315 (95% CI 304-326). This net was resurveyed from November 2014 to April 2015, and it was found that the population had declined by approximately 40% with a population abundance estimate of 176 (165-189)(or 56% if extrapolated over 10 years, Harasti unpublished data).<br/><br/>Also, anecdotal information on <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> populations in Sydney Harbour indicates that there have been declines at various other locations within the Harbour. Resurveys of the Clifton Gardens net in February 2015 only recorded seven mature animals, compared to 70 animals being recorded in the last survey of the net in 2008 (a 98% decline if extrapolated to 10 years). Similarly, divers have reported low numbers of seahorses on nets at Balmoral and Neilsen Park when compared to dives in the early 2000s.<br/><br/>The status of <em>H. whitei</em> populations in the seven other estuaries is unknown. However, no large populations of <em>H. whitei</em> are known to occur in these estuaries, with only Sydney Harbour and Port Stephens known to have large populations (Harasti <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Even though the species is totally protected in Australia ensuring it is not taken from the wild, it’s likely that the decreasing population trend will continue in the future if habitat degradation and loss continue.<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that declines of at least 50-70% have occurred based on the data from the most populated portion of the species' range.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus whitei</em> is thought to be endemic to southeastern Australia, from Sydney, New South Wales to southern Queensland (Lourie<em> et al. </em>1999).","Seahorses in general are typically traded for use as curios, in aquariums, and in traditional medicines (Vincent <em>et al</em>. 2011). Given that <em>Hippocampus whitei</em> is protected across its range in Australia, there is no reported legal trade in this species. Although the species has been detected in the aquarium trade (Martin-Smith and Vincent 2006), there have been no permits issued in the past five years to allow collection of this species for aquaria.

It is often found in multi-species schools, but the percentage of those schools which are composed of <em>A. choerostoma</em> is unknown. Recent anecdotal reports by commercial fishermen of population decline, likely due to overfishing, are not substantiated by reliable, quantitative methods.<br/><br/>Three generation lengths is less than ten years; therefore, a time series of ten years was used for this assessment. Reported landings (of mixed catches reported as 'fry') have declined by approximately 13% over the past 10 years; however, these landings comprise catches of two species, including <em>A. choerostoma</em>. It is unknown what percentage of the landings are represented by <em>A. choerostoma</em>, and it is therefore difficult to assess population trends for this species based on these data. <br/><br/>The estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) for this species is 867 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) is 220 km², which meet the thresholds for Endangered under criteria B1 and B2. In 2009 the species was listed as Least Concern because it was regarded as common and not impacted by any major threatening process. However, it is likely that the decline in landings represents a continuing decline in the abundance of mature individuals of this species. Additionally, as it is endemic to coastal Bermuda, the number of locations is likely one, but certainly less than five. Therefore, this species is reassessed as Endangered (EN B1ab(v)+B2ab(v)).<br/><br/>Given the resiliency of clupeoid species to rebound quickly from low population levels, relaxation of fishing pressure could result in a quick recovery of this species, if this is the major reason for population decline. Quantitative studies of population trends for this species as well as better estimates of species composition in the bait fishery are recommended and would inform the effectiveness of conservation measures within the baitfish management plan currently in place.",This epipelagic species occurs in bays and near patch coral reefs. It is commonly found in multi-species aggregations in the upper half of the water column. It is planktivorous and suspected to have a summer spawning period. It has a very short generation length that is suspected to be no greater than one year. Further studies on the age structure of its population are needed (J.

This species is exploited as part of the mixed-species baitfish fishery (referred to as 'fry'). There is anecdotal evidence reported by the fishermen that catch has significantly declined, likely due to the effects of overfishing (P. Rouja pers. comm. 2015). Reported landings (of mixed catches reported as 'fry') have declined by approximately 13% over the past 10 years, and 80% since peaking in 1988. Peaks in the late 1980s in the baitfish fishery correspond to a general increase in fishing in Bermuda. Bags of baitfish were hung in fish pots to attract fish, but fish pots were banned in 1990, which changed fishing practices in Bermuda dramatically. As such, it is difficult to use catch data alone to say definitively whether the decline in catches after 1990 is due to damage that occurred due to heavy exploitation in the late 1980s, or if it is at least partly related to different fishing practices (J. Pitt pers. comm. 2015). Its true decline may differ from what is currently known as effort and the proportion which <em>A. choerostoma</em> constitutes the catch in this mixed-species fishery are unknown.",Unknown,This species is known only from the waters around Bermuda.

It is dependent on a unique combination of shallow coral and mangrove habitat, especially for juveniles. Significant habitat loss is occurring due to mangrove and coral removal for extensive coastal development within its very restricted range.<br/><br/>Since its original publication on the Red List in 2008, a new major threat has evolved in the spread of the invasive Lionfish, (<em>Pterois volitans</em>) which now encompasses the entire region of the greater Caribbean. Recent studies have revealed that <em>Halichoeres socialis</em> constitutes half of the Lionfish diet, with both juveniles and adults being consumed. Although a quantified population decline is not yet known, studies conducted elsewhere in areas of high Lionfish density have demonstrated reef fish biomass declines of 32-65%. Due to its predominance in the diet, this species is likely experiencing a much higher decline than the average reef fish. Since Lionfish populations off Belize have the potential to grow in density, this threat is expected to increase in magnitude.<br/><br/>Since the number of mature individuals and rate of decline are not known at this time, the species is listed as Endangered (EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v)+B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)). Research is urgently needed on this species' population status, as it may qualify for a higher level of extinction risk. Furthermore, immediate conservation action is needed that implements Lionfish control measures and prevents destruction of its sensitive habitat.","Adults are reef associated and juveniles are mangrove and shallow reef dependent. It is found in shallow coral reefs over coral, sand, rubble or seagrass substrata (Randall and Lobel 2003) to depths of 10 m.

Since it was first assessed in 2008, the invasive Lionfish has been added as another major threat. Due to its small size, schooling, and hovering behaviour, it is easily and frequently targeted (Green and Cote 2014).

A study conducted in the same area by Ingeman and Webster (2015), found that local populations of Gramma loreto (also a common prey item of the Lionfish) face an elevated risk of extirpation as a result of increased predation. Based on these data, the population decline is suspected to be rapid and likely increase into the future as the Lionfish population density grows off Belize.","Currently, population size and trends have not been assessed. From the original description, it may seem that the population numbers are high, as juveniles are abundant where they occur.

Historically it was found around 100 m depth on sandy and muddy bottoms, though it is now mainly found in slightly deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf and upper slope. It is taken as bycatch in multi-species trawl fisheries and offshore bottom longlines. </p>  <p>In the Northeast Atlantic, landings and catch rates for this skate have declined since the early 1990s. The species has completely disappeared from trawl surveys in the North Sea and Celtic Seas in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Scottish surveys still catch it around northwest Scotland and the Porcupine Bank, but at greater depths (180–500 m) than historically reported. This suggests a contraction of the species’ range as a result of trawl fisheries. Records from the outer shelf are scarce, and while survey catch rates have been stable for this species now in the areas it has been considered most abundant since 2001, these rates are very low, therefore do not imply population stability. Misidentification has also prevented reliable estimates of population decline, potentially masking the disappearance of this species from certain areas. For example, Belgium and France are still suspected to be misreporting the species in confusion with Smalleyed Skate (<em>Raja microocellata</em>). </p>  <p>Given the paucity of records from the outer continental shelf, the large declines in landings in recent years, the contracted range to deeper waters, and the very low catch levels seen in the Porcupine Bank survey, Sandy Skate is suspected to have largely in the declined Northeast Atlantic. Fishery independent data for mature individuals are limited and careful monitoring of subpopulations across its range is required to determine accurate population trends for mature individuals.</p>  <p>In the Mediterranean Sea, the occurrence of this species has decreased in the last 60 years. It is no longer encountered in the Gulf of Lions or the Adriatic Sea where it was once relatively common. Mediterranean-wide scientific trawl surveys from 1995–1999 recorded this species in only 12 of 6,336 trawls. Benthic trawl effort has increased significantly during the last 60 years and fishing pressure continues within this species’ depth range.&#160;</p><p>Given the current rarity of Sandy Skate in the Mediterranean Sea, evidence of potential local extinction from two locations, and its likely low intrinsic rate of increase suggested by its large body size and large size at maturity, together with the declines suspected on the Northeast Atlantic, the species is suspected to have declined overall by more than 50% in the last three generations (29 years). Thus, the species is assessed as Endangered.<br/></p>","<p>This benthic skate occurs in offshore shelf waters and on upper slopes from 50–800 m depth. Historically it was found around 100 m depth on sandy and muddy bottoms, although it now seems more abundant in deeper waters where habitat preferences are currently unknown.</p>  <p>This species is oviparous with egg cases 88–90 by 50–60 mm (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Mnsari <em>et al</em>. 2009). The spawning period is unknown (Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998). Maximum recorded size is 120 cm total length (TL), but most individuals caught are between 70 and 80 cm TL (Serena 2005, Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Age at maturity, longevity, size at birth, reproductive age, gestation time, reproductive periodicity, fecundity, rate of population increase and natural mortality are unknown. Its congener <em>L. naevu</em>s has a generation lengh of 9.7 years based on a longevity of 12 years, and an estimated age at maturity of 6.8-7.4 years. Thus, the generation length of <em>L. circularis</em> is also 9.7 years.<br/></p>","<p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>This species is a bycatch in multi-species trawl fisheries operating in the outer parts and edge of the continental shelf. It may also be taken as bycatch in gillnet fisheries targeting anglerfish and longline fisheries targeting hake, though data on the catches in these fisheries are poor. If deepwater commercial fisheries expand into this species’ range they could pose a threat, although there is currently no indication of such expansion. European deepwater fisheries have decreased since 2008, but their effort and extent should be monitored. The relatively large body size would also indicate that it is vulnerable to overfishing. Due to its offshore habitat, it is of no importance to recreational fisheries.</p>  <p>Belgium and France are thought to still record Smalleyed Skate (<em>Raja microocellata</em>) landings erroneously as landings of this species, owing to the shared common name, ‘Sandy Ray’, which hampers the interpretation of some data (ICES 2012).</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>This skate is a bycatch in multi-species trawl fisheries and offshore bottom longlines. Demersal trawl effort has increased both numerically and technologically in the shelf and slope area of the Mediterranean Sea over the last 50 years. For example, the Gulf of Lions area was initially exploited by small-scale benthic trawl fisheries comprising 27 small low powered boats with a total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp. More recently effort has increased to a total of 19,940 hp (1974–1987) and more than half of the fishing effort has been displaced to target small pelagic fish (Aldebert 1997). The Adriatic Sea is subject to trawling mainly by Italian, Croatian, Slovenian, and Albanian fleets, however, no landings data are available (Jukic-Peladic <em>et al</em>. 2001). Although little is known of the life history of this species, it is presumed from similar species that it is slow growing with low fecundity and large juveniles, making it especially vulnerable to fishing exploitation (Brander 1981, Walker and Hislop 1998, Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Dulvy and Reynolds 2002). Moreover, although only large individuals may be landed for consumption, most size classes including the egg cases are caught in fishing nets, as the legal mesh size used in much of the Mediterranean Sea is about 20 mm. Currently, the contents of the cod end are retained and the 20 mm mesh size commonly used in the Mediterranean Sea means that all life stages of this species are fished.</p>  <p>The main intergovernmental decision-making body on fishery management in the Mediterranean Sea, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), has made the decision to refrain from expanding deepwater fishing operations beyond the limit of 1,000 m. This is still within the range of this species, as it is not known to occur below 800 m.</p>","<p>There are two subpopulations of this species, with different situations for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It is likely that there is low connectivity between these two deepwater zones. The overall trend in European waters is of a decline.</p>  <p><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong></p>  <p>This species is rare in the Northeast Atlantic. Accurate determination of abundance trends over the broader area are not possible, as most earlier surveys have focused on shelf fishing grounds, with no long-term, standardised surveys sampling off the edge of the continental shelf. In the southern Northeast Atlantic, French landings data for this species have shown a decline of 92% over about 20 years, from about 500 tonnes per year in the early 1990s to less than 40 tonnes in 2012. French and Portuguese landings data from the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters across all gears combined have remained low but stable between 1999 and 2011, ranging from around 16–17 tonnes at the beginning and end of the time series, with a peak of 61 tonnes in 2005 (ICES 2012). Again, these data are potentially inaccurate owing to misidentification.</p>  <p>In the northern area of the Northeast Atlantic, English surveys in the North and Celtic Seas have not recorded this species since 1996 and 1997 respectively, although Scottish and Norwegian surveys have recorded it in various surveys around Scotland and along the north coast of Norway since then. Given the low numbers caught in offshore shelf habitats, it is possible that the main part of the range is now in deeper water, such as along the edge of the continental shelf. Indeed, most of the recent captures of this species in Scottish surveys have been from waters of 180–500 m depth. In the Norwegian Sea, the Annual Autumn Bottom Trawl Survey on the north coast of Norway did not report any catches of this skate from 1992 to 2000. From 2000 to 2005 it was encountered in very low numbers (zero to nine individuals per survey), showing no particular trend in abundance (ICES 2012). Given the decline in French landings, and that the range has contracted to deeper waters in the Scottish surveys, it is assumed that the population has declined throughout the Northeast Atlantic. There is uncertainty over the magnitude of the decline in abundance for the population as a whole, owing to the lack of reliable data.</p>  <p>Throughout waters west of Britain and Ireland, the Spanish Porcupine Bank survey (on the western Ireland continental shelf) is the only survey that covers the Northeast Atlantic continental shelf, an important part of this species’ range. This survey recorded peak catches in 2003 and 2007, yet this limited time series has low (e.g., about 0.6 kg per haul in 2011) and variable catch rates, with a stable trend in recent years (ICES 2012). Historically, this species may have been more widely distributed in shelf seas west of Britain and Ireland. It is now encountered rarely in surveys on the inner continental shelf, but still exists in deeper waters along the edge of the continental shelf. Given the reported decreases in survey and landings data, the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation is estimated to be declining.</p>  <p><strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong></p>  <p>The occurrence of this species in the Mediterranean Sea has decreased significantly over the last 60 years. It was present in shelf and slope trawl surveys in the Gulf of Lions between 1957 and 1960 but was absent from more recent comparable surveys. Between 1957 and 1960, it was captured in more than 10% of hauls in shelf surveys and in approximately 17% of hauls in slope surveys, whereas between 1966 and 1995 it was not recorded at all from 1,295 hauls in eight trawl surveys (Aldebert 1997).</p>  <p>The International Trawl Surveys in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) cover the northern Mediterranean coast almost continuously, from west Morocco and Spain in the west to the Aegean Sea in the east (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). Six trawl surveys were carried out each year in the coastal areas of four arbitrary geographically defined areas: Western (Morocco, Spain, France), Western Central (Tyrrhenian, Corsican, Sardinia and Sicily coasts), Eastern Central (Adriatic, Ionian and Albanian coasts) and Eastern (Aegean Sea). A total of 6,336 tows were completed between 1994 and 1999 at depths ranging from 10 to 800 m. This skate was recorded in only 12 hauls, all in the western area of the Mediterranean Sea (Baino <em>et al. </em>2001). The evidence that this species may now be scarce in the western Mediterranean Sea points to a substantial reduction in area of occurrence. Its depth range also appears to have contracted, as it was previously found on shelf and slope bottoms between 70 and 275 m (mainly at around 100 m), but is now found only in deeper waters between 500 and 800 m (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001). The overall biomass index assessed through MEDITS in the west, north and eastern Mediterranean Sea was 0.1 kg per km<sup>2</sup> (Baino <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>  <p>Other records in the Mediterranean also show a decline in capture rates. In the south Ligurian Sea and north Tyrrhenian Sea this species is considered rare based on low capture rates. From 1985–2005 only 10 specimens were caught in the bathyal zone (352–566 m depth) (Serena <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 1948, it was recorded in 3.2% of trawl samples from the Adriatic Sea but has been absent from all trawl survey data in this area since then (Ferretti <em>et al.</em> 2013). It can be inferred that the Mediterranean subpopulation is decreasing given reported declines in capture rates from trawl survey data.</p><p>In European waters, the species is suspected to have declined overall by more than 50% in the last three generations (29 years).</p><p><strong><em></em></strong></p>",Decreasing,"<p>Given the lack of authenticated records, the exact range of this species is uncertain. In the Northeast Atlantic, it is found in the Norwegian Sea and northern parts of the North Sea, but has not been encountered around the Faroe Islands since prior to 1996 (ICES 2012). It occurs throughout deeper waters west of Ireland and Britain, with the occasional vagrant found in the Celtic Sea. The species is also still landed from the Bay of Biscay and Iberian waters. </p>  <p>This skate was once present throughout the western Mediterranean Sea and as far east as Libya. It is absent from the Black Sea (Stehmann and Bürkel 1984, Bauchot 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Bianchi 1998, Relini <em>et al</em>. 2000, Ragonese <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sion <em>et al</em>. 2003, Serena 2005, Serena <em>et al</em>. 2011), and now considered absent from the Adriatic Sea (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2013). Its depth range is 50-800 m.</p>",Large individuals may be landed for human consumption.,Marine,"<p>In 1999, the European Union (EU) introduced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for skates and rays of 6,060 tonnes (t) for fisheries operating in the Norwegian Sea and North Sea (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] Division IIa and Subarea IV) based on landing statistics from the previous five years. This TAC has been progressively reduced by 8−25% annually to the current level of 1,256 t. As part of the TAC, the bycatch quota for vessels over 15 metres was set at 25% of live weight of catch retained on board per trip. For much of this period (1999–2014), the TAC was higher than reported landings and therefore was not effectively managing catches. In 2009, skate and ray TACs were established for other EU waters, including the Skagerrak and Kattegat (ICES Division IIIa) and from the northwest coast of Scotland and Northern Ireland to Portuguese waters (ICES Subareas VI–IX) and have also been gradually reduced each year.</p>  <p>In 2006, the European Commission (EC) imposed a permanent ban on all deepwater gillnet fisheries operating at depths greater than 600 m, and imposed maximum limits on the length of nets deployed and the soak time in the remaining fisheries at depths less than 600 m (EC Regulation No. 41/2006). These restrictions may have been of some benefit to this skate. Additionally, since 2008 the EC obligated member states to provide species-specific landings data for the major North Sea species, including this species<em>,</em> in order to improve understanding of skate populations in the area (CEC 2008). In 2009, this obligation was extended to other ICES divisions, including the Celtic Sea (CEC 2009), and has been ongoing since 2008 (CEC 2013).</p>  <p>This skate was listed in Annex III of the Barcelona Convention in 2012, therefore any event of incidental catch and release should be recorded by masters of fishing vessels in the fishing logbook referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, in Mediterranean waters.</p>  <p>Moving forward, this species may benefit from more generic management measures for demersal fisheries, for example mesh size regulations and effort reduction. Appropriate non-trawling areas should be defined to protect a proportion of both the adult population and this skate’s eggs (which are often found in the trawl cod-end) (Ragonese<em> et al.</em> 2001). Further research should be conducted on the population size and trend of the species.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Europe

Adults of this species undertake seasonal migrations moving between coastal and offshore waters and it is an important commercial and recreational species throughout its range. It inhabits nearshore continental shelf waters including coastal bays, lagoons, and estuaries. Larvae and juveniles of this species rely heavily on estuarine habitats as nursery grounds. It has experienced severe declines in spawning stock biomass and catch as well as an increase in natural mortality over the past 20 years from 0.16 in the 1990s increasing to an average of 0.93 from 2007 to 2014. While the driver of the natural mortality increase is unclear, commercial catches have decreased from about 3,175 mt&#160;in 1996 to just over 80 mt&#160;in 2017.

Primary wintering grounds for this species are between the Chesapeake Bay and Cape Lookout (North Carolina) in offshore waters (ASMFC 2016). Spawning takes place primarily from April to June/July with some geographical variation in timing (Shepherd 1988,<span style="""">&#160;ASMFC 2016). </span>It spawns in the bays and estuaries of the mid-Atlantic Bight, bodies of water commonly noted for high turbidity. This species forms spawning aggregations and ""mill"" at the surface during spawning activity (Connaughton and Taylor 1996). Females continuously produce eggs during the spawning season and release them over a period of time rather than once.&#160;The principal&#160;spawning areas are from North Carolina to Montauk, New York (NFSC 2009).&#160;<br/><br/><em>Cynoscion regalis </em>larvae move from spawning areas to nursery areas, located in deeper portions of coastal rivers, bays, sounds, and estuaries where they remain until October to December of their first year.

As adults, weakfish are often found near the periphery of eelgrass beds, perhaps because weakfish feed primarily on shrimp, other crustaceans, and small fish that are found near these grass beds. This species experiences rapid growth in its first year and matures at a young age. While size at age-1 is variable, most fish are 10 to 11 inches long (ASMFC 2016).

There is also concern that the capture by shrimp trawlers of juveniles of this species will have an adverse effect on its abundance (Cordes and Graves 2003). This species is dependent on estuarine nursery habitats during the early juvenile life stage making it vulnerable to pollution and other environmental disturbances during juvenile estuarine phase. Impacts of climate change could also degrade essential coastal and estuarine habitats including coastal flooding and changes in water temperature.<br/><br/>The fishery for this species has experienced a decline in catch rates and a change in age-structure of catches since the early 2000s. While young-of-the-year estimated appeared to be steady and low harvest the population has not shown signs of recovery. Natural mortality (M) of the stock has increased from approximately 0.16 since the mid 1990s to an average of 0.93 from 2007 to 2014 but the driving factor of this increase is still unclear (ASMFC 2016). Total mortality (Z) is high but is still considered to be within acceptable limits (Z = 1.11 in 2014 with a target of 0.93 and a threshold of 1.36).

CPUE was generally consistent through the 1990s with a decline in the early 2000s. Commercial CPUE corresponds with model estimates of population trends, fishery independent and dependent abundance indices, and observed size and age structure (ASMFC 2016). Landings have indicated ""boom and bust"" population cycles for this species over the last century; however, the causes of these large fluctuations are unclear (ASFMC 2016). Starting in the 1980s, commercial landings declined significantly from over 8,619 mt landed in 1982 to about 91 mt landed in 2014 (ASMFC 2016). Recreational catches have also declined with over 4,990 mt landed in 1983 to about 35 mt landed in 2014 (ASMFC 2016) and from over 14 million fish landed in 1996 to less than 2 million in 2017 (NOAA 2018). A recreational harvest-per-unit effort (HPUE) index shows a peak in the mid 1980s with a subsequent decline that reversed in the early 1990s corresponding to an expansion of the age-structure in the catch but has gradually declined since 1998 and is still currently low (ASMFC 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia (Canada) south along the U.S. coast to southeastern Florida (Page&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, R.

It is a long-lived species with a maximum reported age of 42 years and has a large body size with a maximum recorded length of over 200 cm. It is a popular food fish targeted throughout its range in commercial and recreational fisheries for its flesh and its swimbladder (China). This species is considered to be recruitment overfished in South Africa and Australia with the spawning component of the stock having been reduced to 1.3% and 7.0-13% of unfished levels, respectively. In Australia, data for New South Wales show declines of commercial catch but no change in catch per unit effort (CPUE); however, recreational fishing has increased dramatically in recent years and is believed to be causing considerable declines in the population. The spawning component of the stock was reduced by approximately 90% from pristine levels  in the NSW fishery and there have been 70% declines in the population in Viet Nam. This species was previously captured in China in the 1950s and 1960s, but is rarely caught now. Catch and CPUE in Japan appear stable and increasing, respectively, since the early 2000s, albeit due to restocking. There are no catch data available from the Indian subpopulation and it has not been recorded in landings there. Estuarine degradation (reported for South Africa and Australia) is an additional threat to the juvenile stage of this species, as it is an obligate estuarine dependent species. In South Africa, fishing pressure in estuaries, including illegal use of gillnets, has increased considerably. Evidence of the depressed state of the population in South Africa is genetically apparent from the low effective population size and hybridization with a congener.<br/><br/>Given the severe declines recorded in the populations off South Africa, Australia, and Viet Nam and that these populations make up a large portion of this species' range, it is inferred that there has been at least a 50–80% decline in the overall population. over three generation lengths (69 years). This species is therefore listed as Endangered under criteria A2bd.  A review of the stock assessment status of this species is required for South Africa, to assess the fishing regulations that have been put in place. Research to determine the status and impacts of fishing in other parts of the range in Australia (outside NSW) and in other parts of the species global distribution is recommended.","<p>This species occurs in nearshore, turbid coastal habitats and is found in estuaries, in the surf zone, and in the nearshore zone to depths of about 100 m. In the nearshore environment, the species rarely ventures onto the soft, flat substrates exploited by trawlers and prefers reefs, especially wrecks or highprofile rocky reefs that are associated with sand. Large individuals tend to occur near the mouths of estuaries, in surf zones, and near rocky reefs and ridges offshore (Silberschneider and Gray 2008). Juveniles are estuary dependent and euryhaline (Wallace and van der Elst 1975) and tend to prefer deeper waters (Silberschneider and Gray 2008) and turbid estuaries (Griffiths 1996) with young adults having a strong proclivity for estuary habitats (Mann 2013). Adults are found predominantly in the near-shore marine environment, from the surf-zone down to 50 m and possibly even 100 m, but also frequent the lower-middle reaches of turbid estuaries (mostly deeper areas) (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, Griffiths 1996, Cowley<em> et al.</em> 2008, Childs<em> et al. </em>2015). The species shows a strong affinity to estuarine habitats during early adulthood (up to the age/size at 50% maturity of 6 years/~ 100 cm), with reduced estuarine use thereafter (Childs <em>et al.</em> 2015). The maximum recorded length for this species is 181 cm total length (TL) and has also been reported to over 200 cm (Silberschneider&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Anon. 2011). It has a recorded longevity of 42 years (Griffiths and Hecht 1995, Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).&#160;This species is considered to be a benthic carnivore but can feed throughout the water column. It predominantly feeds on crustaceans, small teleost fishes, and squid. The proportion of crustaceans in the diet tends to decrease with increasing fish size, with fishes and squid becoming more predominant (Marais 1984, Kailola&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1993, Griffiths 1997b). Both males and females of this species possess sonic (drumming) muscles that play a role in reproduction. A study by Ueng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2007) documented females in aquaculture tanks in Taiwan emitting sounds during the spawning season including at the time of actual spawning and that the sounds produced by the females differed from the males.&#160;</p><p> Juveniles of this species are generally sedentary while sub-adults and adults can move long distances between estuaries (&gt; 200 km), probably associated with spawning migrations (Silberschneider and Gray 2008). Adults and sub-adults of this species occur in ocean waters and estuary habitats and seem to be more abundant in areas where salinities are closer to that of seawater (Griffiths 1996, Griffiths and Attwood 2005, Childs <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Individuals of this species &lt;115 cm TL tend to exhibit a high degree of estuary fidelity (Griffiths and Attwood 2005). While life history patterns vary between regions, studies conducted in South Africa and Australia have shown that juveniles of this species grow rapidly and can attain 35 cm total length in a single year to 87-90 cm TL in five years (Silberschneider and Gray 2008). Juveniles recruit to estuaries around 30 cm TL (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995).&#160;<br/> <br/> Varying sizes at sexual maturity have been reported from different regions. In South Africa, 50% of male and females were mature at 92 and 107 cm TL, respectively, and all males and female were mature at &gt;110 and 120 cm TL, respectively; the latter correspond to 5-7 years of age for males and 6-8 years of age (Griffiths 1996). Size at 50% maturity in New South Wales was smaller with about 51 cm TL for males and 68 cm TL for females, corresponding to ~2 years of age and ~3 years of age, respectively. All males and females were mature at &gt;63 cm TL and &gt;79 cm TL, respectively (Silberschneider and Gray 2005, 2008). In South and Western Australia, size and age at 50% maturity for females was 93 cm and 6 years of age and for males was 88 cm and 5-6 years of age (Farmer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Silberschneider and Gray 2008).&#160;<br/> <br/>In South Africa, adults undergo a seasonal spawning migration from the south coast to the east coast and spawn in aggregations on well-known inshore reefs and wrecks at night in late winter/spring (Griffiths 1996). In Western Australia <em>A. japonicus</em> form spawning aggregations during the summer in turbid waters around high tide, late afternoons and in early evenings (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/> The eggs of this species are about&#160;938 ± 24 µm in diameter and are pelagic. In a laboratory environment, eggs hatched 28-30 hours after spawning with larvae length of 2.2-2.3 mm total length (Battaglene and Talbot 1994). Larvae of this species were collected in the highest concentrations below 30 m depth during daytime sampling in coastal New South Wales waters (Gray 1995). Night time sampling revealed highest concentrations of larvae between 20-60 m depth with water temperatures between 21-23°C (Smith 2003). Estimates of fecundity of&#160;<em>A. japonicus</em>&#160;are not available but&#160;hatchery-kept fish around 10 kg were found to produce approximately 1 million eggs and the spawning mode is group synchronous (Battaglene and Talbot 1994). Spawning most likely occurs in nearshore coastal waters although there is evidence to suggest that it may also occur in the lower reaches of estuaries. The time of spawning appears to vary among geographic regions and with latitude and is probably related to water temperature and oceanography (Silberschneider and Gray 2005, 2008).&#160;In South Africa (KZN) spawning occurs from August to November (KZN), or October to January (SEC) (Griffiths 1996) and in Australia, it occurs from November to January/February (Silberschneider and Gray 2008).&#160;</p><p></p><p>Mirimin <em>et al.</em> (2014) demonstrated an estimated hybridization incidence of 0.7% (3 out of 422 sampled fish) between <em>A. japonicus</em> and <em>A. inodorus</em> in the wild on the south coast of South Africa. The absence of F2 hybrids and absence of introgression resulting from backcrossing suggest that F1 hybrids are incapable of reproducing successfully and/or that hybridisation between these species is a rare event. The authors could not determine whether hybridization was the result of natural events (e.g. a shift in distribution range) or anthropogenic pressure (such as size-selective pressure due to overﬁshing). Natural mortality of this species has been estimated at M = 0.1 for South Africa and Australia (Griffiths 1997a, Silberschneider and Gray 2005). Generation length for this species was estimated to be 23 years and calculated using the following equation:&#160; Age at 1st maturity + (max age - age at first maturity) /2.&#160;</p>","Overexploitation and habitat loss are the major threats to <em>A. japonicus</em>. This species is an important resource in several fisheries throughout its range but they exhibit intrinsic life history characteristics that make them vulnerable to exploitation including predictable aggregation sites, juvenile estuarine dependence, and strong adult site fidelity. The adults in many areas are being targeted and overfished beyond the recruitment threshold. Juveniles are highly accessible and are targeted by inshore anglers as they are confined to their natal estuaries. Many of the estuaries in their home range in South Africa are degraded owing to poor catch management, and the largest estuary in southern Africa (Lake St. Lucia) has been closed for several years because of drought and poor management. In KwaZulu-Natal, this species aggregates to spawn at well-known reefs and wrecks, where they are targeted at night by boat-based commercial and recreational linefishers resulting in catches of numerous, large, gravid individuals. Similar aggregations also occur in Western Australia which also makes this species vulnerable to capture. In addition to being caught by recreational fishers, this species is also taken in prawn trawl catches, gill nets, and beach seine catches in Australia (Hall 1984, Kailola <em>et al.</em> 1993, Broadhurst and Kennelly 1994, Liggens<em> et al. </em>1996), where threats include overfishing, habitat degradation, and viral disease (e.g. redspot). Fish kills in estuaries have resulted from acidified and deoxygenated water which have also been cited as possible reasons for the decline in catch numbers (Kearney 2009). Foraging behaviour of <em>A. japonicus </em>is significantly reduced with increased anthropogenic disturbance such as boating (Payne<em> et al. </em>2015).","<p>In South Africa and eastern Australia, this species is considered to be recruitment overfished (Griffiths 1997a, Silberschneider and Gray 2008). Spawning biomass per recruit was estimated to be between 7.0-13.0% of pristine levels in southeastern Australia (Silberscheider&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) and was estimated at 1.0-4.5% of pristine values in South Africa which suggests that this population is severely depleted (Griffiths 1997a). A more recent analysis showed that the population accessed by the Eastern Cape shore fishery in South Africa has not improved, with spawning biomass levels estimated at 1.3% of unfished levels (Winker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;&#160;</p><p>There have been serious declines in the Australian and South African regions due to recreational fishing, and it is estimated that the recreational catches from the Australian states (NSW, Victoria, SA and WA) are at least three times greater than the commercial catches. Total reported commercial catches around 248,598 kg (2001/2002) and total estimated recreational catches of 925,057 kg in 2001 (Henry and Lyle 2003, Silberschneider and Gray 2008) (recreational data may include other sciaenid species). In New South Wales, available data suggest that the commercial catch shows a decline in the proportion of larger and older fish in recent catches compared to that of those from 1986-1990 and 1994-1999 (Kearney 2009). The age composition of commercial landings indicates that the stock is heavily fished, with 98% of the fish being under five years old (<em>A. japonicus</em> has been aged to 24 years in eastern Australia) (Scandol<em> et al</em>. 2008). The data are confusing because as the commercial catch has declined the recreational effort has increased considerably (for example in NSW the recreational catch is somewhere between two to 10 times that of the commercial take); accurate information on the recreational catch is very limited (Kearney 2009). In a survey conducted in coastal waters off New South Wales, Australia, larvae of this species were most abundance in subsurface waters below 30 m depth (Gray 1995). Night sampling revealed higher larval concentration of this species between 20 and 60 m depth (Smith 2003). The commercial fishery in New South Wales was characterized by declining catches and a reduction in the proportion of mature individuals in landings. From 2002–2005 commercial landings were dominated (83%) by fish within 15 cm of the current minimum legal total length of 45 cm and aged 2-3 years (more than 80%), even though individuals of this species can attain lengths of 200 cm and live longer than 30 years (Silberschneider<em> et al.</em> 2009).</p><p>In South Africa, <em>A. japonicus</em> is currently managed as a single stock from False Bay to KwaZulu-Natal Province (Griffiths 1997a). West of Cape Agulhas, the relative proportion of<em> A. japonicus</em> found in <em>Argyrosomus </em>spp. catches has declined markedly. Commercial line boat fishermen catch an average of 197 tonnes per annum (1988-1992) in South Africa. Just as in Australia, recreational fishermen often target this species and are believed to catch at least as much as, and possibly more than, the commercial fishermen (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, 1997a). In the Transkei, CPUE showed a decreasing trend by number and mass during the period 1977-2000 as well as in the Eastern Cape during the period 1982-1998 (0.05 to 0.02 fish/angler/hour) showing a 60% decline (Pradervand and Govender 2003). CPUE shore angling data from KwaZulu-Natal also showed severe declines with an 80% decrease from the period 1994-1996 to 2008-2009 (0.01 fish.angler<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup> to 0.002 fish.angler<sup>-1</sup>.day<sup>-1</sup>) (Mann<em> et al.</em> 1997, Dunlop 2011). Retained catch declined by 76% by number and 69% by weight from the period 1994-1996 to 2008-2009 (Mann<em> et al</em>. 1997, Dunlop 2011). Time-series of recreational data are lacking in South Africa; boat-based catches are mainly made at night and neither this facet nor shore angling are monitored. Considerable catches of large <em>A. japonicus</em> continue to be made by recreational and commercial boats at night on spawning aggregations on the east coast of South Africa, but there are no formal records. There is evidence of a genetic bottleneck for the South African population, resulting in low and declining effective population size of between a few hundred and a few thousand mature fish, particularly of individuals born after 2005 (Mirimin <em>et al</em>. 2016). In addition to ongoing excessive fishing pressure and degradation of estuary nursery habitat, these authors link these bottlenecks to unintended consequences of the implementation of management measures and changes in the distribution of fishing effort as well as to environmental perturbations such as drought and anomalous flood events in estuaries. These authors stress that effective population size is not necessarily a reflection of actual population size, but it is an accurate measure of breeding success in the years assessed, with as few as 50 pairs breeding in some years. Illegal gill netting in estuaries on the east coast of South Africa has increased markedly, and the proportion of <em>A. japonicus</em> in these catches from 2010 to 2018 declined by about half (S. Lamberth, Dept of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Cape Town, South Africa).</p><p>This species was widely distributed in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea until around 1955. By 1965, fish density and its distribution were severely reduced but in later years catch statistics ceased, leaving the stock condition unknown. Annual catches from Japanese trawlers in the East China and Yellow Seas were 456 t in 1955, ~200 t in 1956-57, ~100 t in 1958-59 decreasing to less than 20 t by 1964-1965 with catch statistics ceasing thereafter (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the surveys conducted twice a year by Seikai National Fisheries Research Institution, this species has not been captured for 20 years (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007). This species occurs in coastal Japanese waters off the Pacific coasts along the Kuroshio Current and probably forms a single stock. Annual catches in the Miyazaki Prefecture were 100-150 t in 2001-2014, ~5 t from the East China Sea in 2004-2014, and ~20-30 t from the Pacific coast with catch trends appearing to increase gradually between the three prefectures. The stock in the Miyazaki Pref. has a tendency of increasing with fluctuations in terms of abundance index and is generally constant. From 1990 - 2006, 300,000-400,000 artificially reared juveniles were released annually but this has ceased in recent years because the stock level was considered to be high (Sasaki 2016). The stock has completely collapsed in the East China Sea (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007) but is considered to be stable in western Japan, Miyazaki, Ooita and Kagoshima prefectures. In the Miyazaki Pref. catches increased from 60-170 t in 2000-2014 and CPUE is increasing with fluctuations, likely because of restocking. CPUE of hook and line fisheries in Miyazaki Pref. has increased by about 3x between 1992 and 2013 (Miyazaki Prefecture Fisheries Institute 2016).</p><p>In China in the 1950s-1960s this species was commonly caught; however, since the 1970s the species has rarely been caught. It is unclear why it is no longer captured, but the original population was thought to be small (Chu 1963, J.-H. Cheng pers. comm. 2009). In Viet Nam, from 1990-2000 the CPUE has been reduced by 70% mainly by electro-fishing (N. Van Quan 2004). This species has not recently been reported from India and fisheries data are not available (R. Nair pers. comm. 2019).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Argyrosomus japonicus</em>&#160;is a pantropical species occurring throughout the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa to Beira, Mozambique (Sasaki 2001, Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data), the coast of Oman and the Gulf of Aden to Pakistan (Silberschneider and Gray 2008) and the western and eastern coasts of India (Sasaki 2001, Psomadakis <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and Sri Lanka. This species is also known from northern Pacific, from Viet Nam (Kimura <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), Hong Kong north to South Korea, southern Japan (Sasaki 2001), Indonesia (as <em>A. amoyensis</em>; Sasaki 2001) and from the Burnett River, Queensland, Australia to the North West Cape in Western Australia (Kailola <em>et al</em>. 1993). This species occurs from the nearshore zone to depths of 150 m (Sasaki 2001, Psomadakis <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;<span style=""""><br/></span>","<p>Total worldwide estimates of catch for this species are not possible to determine as landed catches from many countries are unknown or not reported (Silberscheider and Gray 2008). This species is considered the premier angling species of the inshore environment (estuaries and surf zone) along the South African east coast from Cape Agulhas to KwaZulu-Natal. It is one of the most important species in recreational, commercial, and subsistence fisheries in South Africa (Griffiths 1996). The flesh is generally sold fresh, but sometimes frozen. In Australia, it is an important commercial and recreational angling species known as the ""mulloway"". It is caught in estuaries, in the surf and offshore, using hook and line, gill nets, seine nets and trawl nets (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995).&#160;It is considered a commercial marine food-fish species in Taiwan. Fishermen in the Penghu Archipelago culture this species in saltwater net cages (Ueng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;This species is caught in the Miyazaki Prefecture, the Ooita Pref. and the Kagoshima Pref by set net, long line, and fishing rod. It is cultivated in Miyazaki and Kagoshima Pref. in small-scale facilities.<br/> <br/> Juveniles of this species are frequently taken as bycatch in estuarine and oceanic prawn trawl fisheries and are often discarded with the majority of fish measuring &lt;20 cm total length (Liggins&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Liggins and Kennelly, 1996, Kennelly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998). This species is also taken as bycatch in estuarine gillnet and beach seine fisheries (Gray 2002, Gray and Kennelly 2003).&#160;</p><p>In Australia, there is an aquaculture industry for&#160;<em>A. japonicus&#160;</em>(Gooley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000). The potential for culture of this species is also being investigated in South Africa (Viljoen 2019). It is considered a commercial marine food-fish species in Taiwan - fishermen in the Penghu Archipelago culture this species in saltwater net cages (Ueng <em>et al</em>. 2007). There have been considerable efforts at re-stocking in Japan (Sasaki 2016).&#160;&#160;This species is also caught for their swim bladders, which are eaten in China.&#160;&#160;</p><p> <br/> </p>",Marine,"In South Africa, several management policies have been set up with the minimum legal lengths (MLL) set at 60 cm TL, (depending on the region) along with a recreational bag limit of 1 per person/day, and license requirements. There is no limit for commercial fisheries but they may only land one individual &gt; 110 cm TL per person/day. These MLLs are not based purely on biological data but attempt to take misidentification with other <em>Argyrosomus </em>species&#160;in to account. There is regional variation in regulations considering the similarity between the three harvested <em>Argyrosomus</em> spp that occur in South African waters (Childs and Fennessy 2013). Its range currently overlaps with a number of MPAs, which afford the species some protection, and it will benefit from additional protection from the expansion and additional of several other MPAs in 2019.&#160;<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is managed by spatial and temporal fishing restrictions, gear regulations, MLLs and recreational bag limits. The MLLs vary among state jurisdictions, with most MMLs set at 40 cm total length.&#160;Its range also overlaps with several Marine Protected Areas in Australia.&#160;<br/><br/>Various bycatch reduction devices to exclude juveniles from capture in prawn fisheries have been developed in Australia (Broadhurst and Kennelly 1994); however, the potential benefits of these changes in fishing gear on stocks have not been assessed. The impacts of recreational and commercial hook and release on survival remains largely unquantified, particularly from deeper waters where fish may suffer stress from barotrauma (Silberschneider and Gray 2008).&#160;This species has also been artificially reared to supplement wild stocks in Australia (Silberschneider and Gray 2008) and Japan (Sasaki 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is under study by various fishery jurisdictions but more detailed data from consistent research is lacking (Scandol <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kearney 2009, Silberschneider and Gray 2008). More knowledge of detailed stock structure is required, as is knowledge of fish population movements along coasts and estuaries. Future studies using genetic markers as indicators of stock structure should be very useful (Silberschneider and Gray 2008).<br/><br/>Research to update its population status, and to assess the impacts of fishing and estuarine degradation, is recommended. The extent to which the subpopulations are distinct and worthy of separate species designation also needs to be resolved urgently, as this has implications for the status of this species.","",,false,false,Global

The population has declined markedly due to observed overfishing trends, possibly compounded by reduced river flow. Spawning biomass per recruit was at about 20% of the unfished level in South Africa in the mid-1990s. Occurrence as juveniles in bycatch of prawn trawling at that time negatively affected the adult population. Modelling of standardized commercial catch per unit effort data from South Africa’s commercial line fishery data from 1994 projected to 2017 (23 years = three generations) indicates a 67% decline in the South African population. There is only a slight suggestion of recovery in 2015, the last available year of the time series of catch data. A similar trend in catch rate is apparent for the recreational boat-based sector which also targets this species. This is despite bag and size limit regulations in South Africa, and substantial declines in trawling and commercial line fishing effort since 2007 and 2003 respectively. Data from Mozambique are limited but the populations there also appears to have declined substantially due to over-fishing. Although not estuarine-dependent, there are also concerns about habitat impacts, as the species is dependent on riverine input, which is increasingly being compromised in South Africa and Mozambique. A newly-promulgated Marine Protected Area in South Africa will provide considerable protection from harvesting of juveniles and adults. This species is listed as Endangered under criterion A2bd due to observed levels of exploitation. Improvements in monitoring of catches&#160;are required; urgent consideration should be given to creation of a protected area in appropriate habitats in Mozambique.","This shoaling species inhabits coastal waters (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004). Juveniles are found on shallow sand or mud substrata, particularly the Thukela Bank prawn trawling grounds (Fennessy 1994), and the adults occur predominantly on low relief, shallow (&lt;50 m) reefs (Fennessy 1994, Fennessy and Mann 2013). In South Africa, it is mostly caught beyond the surf zone to depths of 80 m and is seldom found south of Port St. Johns in the Eastern Cape although larvae are reportedly common inshore as far south as Algoa Bay (Pattrick and Strydom 2008).&#160;The size at 50% sexual maturity for this species is about 33 cm total length (TL) and age at 50% sexual maturity is about ~2.5 years for females (poorly estimated). Spawning occurs from June to September near Thukela Banks in central KwaZulu-Natal (S. Fennessy, ORI, pers. obs., van der Elst&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1991)&#160;and probably occurs near Xai-Xai as well (S. Fennessy, ORI, pers. comm.). Maximum weight recorded is 7 kg, maximum length recorded is 110 cm, and the maximum recorded age is 13 years (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995, Mann 2013, Fennessy unpubl. data). Lamberth <em>et al. </em>(2009) demonstrated a relationship between flow of the Thukela River and catches of <em>A. thorpei</em> (30% of catch variability was explained by flow rates), implying a reliance of this species on riverine flow.&#160;Natural mortality for this species was estimated at&#160;0.34 yr<sup>-1&#160;</sup>(van der Elst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1991), but this is probably over-estimated and its likely to be closer to 0.2 yr<sup>-1</sup>.&#160;<span style=""""><br/></span><span style=""""><br/></span><span style="""">Generation length for this species is 7.75 years using the following equation: age at first maturity + (maximum age - age at first maturity) / 2</span>","Large numbers of juvenile <em>A. thorpei</em>&#160;were captured as bycatch in the inshore prawn trawl fishery off the east coast of South Africa particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. This species mainly occurred in trawl catches, during January and February each year (Fennessy 1994).&#160;An incrementally lengthened closed season for the trawl fishery was instituted from around 1996 and currently is of 6-months duration (September-October inclusive). Since 2003, trawling effort declined sharply owing to non-viability of the targeted prawns, and since 2007 has been negligible.&#160;In August 2019 a large MPA was promulgated in the main habitat of this species, which will preclude trawling, as well as eliminating line fishing on large areas of reef habitat for adults. Although KwaZulu-Natal commercial line-boat fishermen no longer target the reefs where large catches of this species traditionally used to be made, recreational boat fishermen in the north of the province continue to catch this species. Anecdotal reports from commercial line-fishermen are that the traditional areas for catching this species have not been worth fishing in since the early 1990s and indications are that the stock collapsed at this time. In 2003, a substantial (50%) reduction in the number of issued commercial fishing licenses occurred, so as to control overall reef line fishing effort. Notwithstanding this, and the demise of the shallow water trawl fishery, the population does not appear to have recovered, although there is some sign of increased catch rates from 2014.&#160;<br/><br/>In South Africa, the majority of the population occurs on the river-influenced Thukela Banks ecosystem in northern KwaZulu-Natal. If planned additional dams on the Thukela River are built, there will be a consequent reduction in turbidity and habitat, assuming a 44% reduction in flow in the Thukela River, there will be an estimated reduction in catches of 28% for <em>A. thorpei</em>&#160;(Lamberth <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;Further ecological stresses could be imposed by proposed offshore mining on the Thukela Banks (Mann 2013), although the recently declared MPA in the area should preclude this type of activity.<br/><br/>In southern Mozambique, the situation is analogous, but with limited data available. Semi-industrial line fishing effort there has been excessive for several years and trawling for shallow-water prawns off the Limpopo River has probably resulted in substantial juvenile bycatch. Ongoing reduction in flow of the Limpopo River as a result of water abstraction for agriculture is likely to be causing similar declines in habitat availability.&#160;There are recent reports of additional industrial fishing gears (including fish trawls and demersal gill nets) being permitted for use, which pose additional threats.","This species has declined due to overfishing and possibly reduced river flow into the sea. In 1994, when it was exposed to trawling (as bycatch of a prawn-directed fishery) and line fishing (targeted), the spawning biomass level per recruit was estimated to be around 20% of the pristine (unfished) level in South Africa (Fennessy 1994). The growth model parameters (and hence some of the biological reference points) that this stock assessment is based on were poorly estimated owing to the limited availability of large specimens and inadequate numbers obtained during the spawning season.&#160;Trawling effort was subsequently reduced incrementally to reduce bycatch, culminating in a 6-month seasonal closure which provided protection during the months when trawl catches of this species were highest (Fennessy 1994). Since 2007, trawling effort has been negligible owing to non-recruitment of prawns (Fennessy unpubl. data.).<br/>&#160;<br/>CPUE for this species has decreased in both recreational and commercial linefish fisheries in South Africa from 1994-1996 to 2008-2009. Based on two separate surveys, for 1994-1996 CPUE was 2.64 (fish-outing <sup>-1</sup>) and 2.71 (kg fisher-day<sup> -1</sup>) for recreations and commercial fisheries respectively decreasing to CPUE of 1.47 (fish-outing <sup>-1</sup>) and 1.47 (kg fisher-day <sup>-1</sup>) in 2008-2009 (Dunlop and Mann 2013). In 1990, the total commercial catch from KwaZulu-Natal declined from 132.7 mt to 14.2 mt in 1998 (S. Fennessy, ORI, unpubl. data.; Fennessy and Mann 2013). Catch composition in the recreational boat sector decreased since the 1990s with <em>A. thorpei </em>comprising 8.8% numerically and 3.9% by weight of catches in 1994-1996 decreasing considerably to 0.6% and 0.29% numerically and by weight, respectively (Mann<em> et al.</em> 1997, Dunlop and Mann 2013). Contribution to commercial catch composition for this species also decreased from 37% by weight in 1990 to 5% by 1998 (S. Fennessy, ORI, unpubl. data.). From 1994-1996 to 2008-2009 commercial catches for this species continued to decline from 1.9% numerically and 2.5% by weight to 0.46% and 0.61% numerically and by weight, respectively (Mann <em>et al.</em> 1997, Dunlop and Mann 2013). Standardized CPUE data from the commercial hook and line fishery in KwaZulu-Natal indicate a substantial decline from the early 1990s until 2015 (see Supplementary Material). Over three generation lengths (22.5 years) this represents a 67% decline for the South African population.&#160;Commercial fishers indicate that they no longer fish on the reefs which are the main adult habitat in central KwaZulu-Natal, owing to sub economic catch rates. Examination of nominal catch data from recreational boats (which still fish on these reefs) reveal a similar decline over this period, with a slight increase at the end (see Supplementary Material), which supports anecdotal reports of signs of recovery of this species – perhaps due to a combination of reduced/negligible trawling effort on juveniles (as bycatch) since 2007 and reduced commercial linefishing effort (by means of permit reduction) from 2003.&#160;<br/><br/>Information from Mozambique was lacking for the assessment, but populations there are also thought to have declined due to over-fishing, and may have even collapsed –&#160;inferred from excessive semi-industrial linefishing effort in the southern region and over-fished status of several other co-occurring reef fishes in this region (Fennessy <em>et al. </em>2012); perhaps compounded by the highly reduced flow from the Limpopo River with negative implications for juvenile habitat. Recent increases in industrial effort using fish trawls and demersal gill nets are a concern for this species. Port sampling of semi-industrial lineboats in Maputo in the late 1990s indicated that at times <em>A. thorpei</em> (recorded as<em> A. hololepidotus </em>which does not occur there) contributed substantially to landings but made much reduced contributions in subsequent years (van der Elst<em> et al.</em> 2003, Fennessy<em> et al.</em> 2012). The non-random and discontinuous nature of the sampling precludes further interpretation, although Mutombene <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) report that, from limited onboard observer data, aggregated from 2007-2010, it contributed 10% to semi-industrial catches (units unspecified) and from 2011-2014 less than 4% (exact proportion not determinable from the report).",Decreasing,"This species occurs on the southeast African coast from Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Xai Xai, Mozambique, but its main abundance is in central KwaZulu-Natal and the northern part of southern Mozambique (Gaza province) where suitable habitats are found. Reports from the west coast of Madagascar (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995) are likely in error (M. Griffiths pers. comm. 2018) as no substantiating records can be found. This species occurs from the surf zone to 100 m depth (Fennessy 1994).","In KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), this species is captured by commercial lineboat fishermen, by the recreational line-boat sector, and to a limited extent by shore anglers. It is also caught by semi-industrial line-boat fishermen in southern Mozambique (Griffiths and Heemstra 1995) and possibly by demersal fish trawlers and demersal gill netters (both industrial). Although KwaZulu-Natal commercial line-boat fishermen seldom target the reefs where large catches of this species traditionally used to be made, recreational boat fishermen continue to catch this species. It is not clear whether stocks are recovering but if they do recover, it is likely that they will be targeted again. Lamberth <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2009) estimated an annual value of $300,000 for South African commercial and recreational catches combined over the period 1985–2001.&#160;<span style=""""><br/><br/>Juveniles of this species were frequently taken as bycatch in the prawn trawl fishery between January and February on the Thukela Bank but a 6-month closed season reduced these catches significantly and there is currently little prawn trawling conducted in the area (Fennessy 1994, S. Fennessy ORI unpubl. data.).&#160;<br/><br/></span>",Marine,"In 1996 a closed season for shallow-water prawn trawlers operating on t<span style="""">he Thukela Banks in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) was implemented for January and February, specifically to reduce trawl catches during the months when juvenile&#160;<em>A. thorpei</em> are more abundant in the area. This was based on a study which demonstrated that trawl </span>catches were impacting commercial linefishing catches of this species (Fennessy 1994). The closed season was subsequently extended to six months to reduce bycatch generally.&#160;Trawling on the Thukela Banks has virtually ceased since 2005 owing to non-viability of prawn catches (Fennessy unpubl. data). The newly-promulgated (August 2019) extensive Thukela MPA will exclude trawling and will also reduce line fishing effort. Other regional MPAs may provide some protection for this species, specifically the iSimangaliso MPA, although this is not the preferred habitat of <em>A. thorpei</em>. This species also receives some protection from the Ponta Ouro Partial Marine Reserve in southern Mozambique waters and within the Pondoland MPA in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa (B. Mann, ORI, unpubl. data.). Protection of this species is needed in the Xai-Xai area of southern Mozambique where suitable habitat exists (Fennessy and Mann 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>For recreational linefishermen fishing from&#160;<span style="""">a boat in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, there is a minimum size limit of 40 cm and a daily bag limit of 5, but only one fish &gt;110 cm may be kept.

Commercial linefishing effort in South Africa has been reduced by about 50% because far fewer licenses were issued as of ca. 2003, although it is not clear whether this only removed latent effort.&#160;Up until 2016 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, the regulations were fairly well policed, and regular monitoring of recreational fishers was undertaken, but deployment of personnel has been much reduced subsequently, and there are concerns that compliance has declined markedly.","",,false,false,Global

This species is also associated with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pyura stolonifera</span> (a large ascidian) and sponges, but significantly more adult and juvenile seahorses are found at sites characterized by high vegetation cover (75%) than at sites with lower cover (Teske<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2007). Vegetated sites make up approx 11% of Knysna estuary (Teske <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), thus large areas of habitat in the Knysna estuarine system may be unsuitable for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis</span> because of the absence of submerged vegetation (Toeffie 2000 in Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis </span>can also tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), such as salinities ranging from 1-59 g/kg (Whitfield 1995). The species is also known to use artificial habitats extensively (Claassens 2016).<br/><br/>Juvenile <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis</span> are often found in low frequencies during surveys, likely because they spend time in the plankton, at least initially, and older juveniles may use different habitat from the adults sampled (Bell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Juvenile length is strongly dependent on temperature and photoperiod, with higher temperatures and longer photoperiods resulting in juveniles being smaller in captivity (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hippocampus capensis </span>adults feed predominantly on small crustaceans which are sucked from submerged leaf surfaces or from the water column (Whitfield 1995).<br/><br/>This species is ovoviviparous, and the males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). Breeding occurs in the austral summer, when water temperatures approach 20°C and sexual maturity is attained in about one year at 65 mm standard length (Whitfield 1995). In captivity, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis </span>are diurnally active and have an elaborate courtship and mating ritual involving brood pouch inflation, tail grasping and ‘face-to-face’ positioning (Grange and Cretchley 1995).","This species’ primary habitat, the Knysna estuary, is among the most heavily used water bodies in South Africa (Bell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003) and human settlements and associated industrial, domestic, and recreational activities are increasing around all estuaries where this species has been recorded (Mkare <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>The area is under threat from urban expansion and land-use changes in the catchment; stormwater runoff has increased in volume, and peak flows carry suspended sediment into the estuary (strong currents sweep animals and plants out into the sea and silt depositions result in the smothering of habitat and the clogging of gills); rising population and developments to provide piped water threatens freshwater inflow; and waste water disposal brings in chemical and biological pollutants (Marker 2003). Development surrounding the estuary is known to deposit trace metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides and organic wastes into the estuary (Chmelik 1975 in Bell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Within the estuary, the cumulative impact of boats may significantly affect the seagrass habitats of this species (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Pollution events or other disturbances which affect the submerged plant beds of these estuaries will have a direct and indirect impact on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis </span>populations (Skelton 1987 in Whitfield 1995), yet construction developments and pollution continue (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Teske <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hippocampus capensis </span>also appears to be vulnerable to water temperature increases. In 1991, 3,000 dead seahorses were found along the shores of the Swartvlei estuary after heavy rainfall and flooding caused a breach in the estuarine mouth and partially drained the estuary, leaving many individuals trapped in small pockets of remaining water. Mortality was attributed to the sudden increase in water temperature following the reduction in water level (Russell 1994). When the water levels drop and individuals are restricted to smaller pools, they are also susceptible to high levels of predation (P. Joubert pers. comm. 2010). Furthermore, large-scale flooding may substantially alter the estuaries in which this species is found (C.A.P.E. Estuaries Management Programme 2010). The present rate at which construction developments and other human activities are increasing along the estuary is alarming; the resulting habitat degradation may make recovery of populations after a naturally occurring disaster, such as a freshwater flood, increasingly difficult (Teske <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/>Furthermore, recently observed specimens of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis</span> also appear to be infected with lesions; the disease appears most often in individuals using artificial habitats (P. Joubert pers. comm. 2010).","Recent surveys and molecular studies on the species indicate ongoing declines in the number of mature individuals in each of the three inhabited estuaries, but these have not been quantified (Mkare <em>et al.</em> 2017). Declines are thought to be in addition to those described below. Further research is needed to determine the level of decline and how the population fluctuates between years.&#160; <br/><br/>The total population estimate for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hippocampus capensi</span>s in the Knysna estuary (mean, with range representing 95% confidence intervals) was 89,000 seahorses (range 30,000–148,000) in 2000 (Bell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003) and 62,000 (range 41,000–82,000) in 2001. In 2002, the Swartvlei and Keurbooms supported 995,000 (range 390,000–1.7 million) and 836,000 (range 242,000–1.7 million) seahorses, respectively. In 2003, the Swartvlei estuary supported only 176,000 (range 83,000–280,000) seahorses, and no seahorses could be found in the Keurbooms estuary (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).<br/><br/>As of 2003, assuming the total population of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis</span> in the Knysna estuary remained relatively constant at 62,000 individuals between 2001 and 2003, the estimated total population in all estuaries was 238,000 seahorses (range 124,000-360,000), down from 1.9 million seahorses (range 675,000-3.5 million) between 2001 and mid-2002 (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Juveniles typically constitute 5-20% (average 13%) of individuals sampled (Lockyear <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), resulting in an estimated mean population size of approximately 207,000 mature individuals as of 2003.<br/><br/>In 2005, the Knysna and Swartvlei population sizes appeared to be healthy (M. Cherry pers. comm. 2010), and in 2010, populations were reported anecdotally to be seen in abundance in many of the marinas in the Knysna estuary and as being present in the Swartvlei estuary (T. Meintjes pers. comm. 2010, P. Joubert pers. comm. 2010). Similar to the 2003 surveys, preliminary surveys of the Keurbooms estuary in 2011 found no seahorses, despite the availability of suitable habitat (Appleby 2011). However, anecdotal evidence indicates individuals may occasionally be seen in this estuary (T. Meintjes pers. comm. 2010; Appleby 2011).<br/><br/>Recently constructed artificial habitats (e.g., marinas/boat harbours) appear to act as protective habitat for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. capensis</span> (P. Joubert pers. comm. 2010) and, as relatively large numbers of individuals are seen in these habitats (B. Allanson pers. comm. 2010), they may have a beneficial effect on population size.<br/><br/>It is unknown whether extreme fluctuations of population size occur for this taxon. In 2002, seahorse densities were high in the Swartvlei and Keurbooms estuaries but, in 2003, seahorses were absent from the Keurbooms estuary and the population size in the Swartvlei estuary had decreased by more than 80% (Lockyear <em>et al</em>. 2006). The population size in the Knysna estuary declined approximately 30% between 2000 and 2001 (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lockyear <em>et al</em>. 2006). Since 2003, individuals have been seen in abundance in the Knysna and Swartvlei estuaries, although population size has not been quantified recently. Populations may not yet have recovered in the Keurbooms estuary, according to preliminary 2011 surveys (Appleby 2011). These results suggest that populations may occasionally undergo extreme fluctuations in the smaller estuaries, but experience fluctuations to a lesser degree in the larger Knysna estuary. It is expected that fluctuations are not due to changes in life stages or dispersal, but rather that individuals are susceptible to being washed out of the smaller estuaries as a result of floods and increased stormwater run-off from developments (Marker 2003, Lockyear <em>et al</em>. 2006). With <em>H. capensis</em>’ poor swimming ability and reliance on plant holdfasts, strong currents could sweep animals and plants out into the sea and silt depositions could result in the smothering of habitat and the clogging of gills. Individuals remaining in small pockets of water in the drained estuaries after floods may be subject to mortality from increased water temperatures (Russell 1994) and predation (P. Joubert pers. comm). The larger Knysna estuary thus may act as an infrequent but continuous exporter of colonists to the smaller estuaries (Teske <em>et al</em>. 2003). The rates of recolonization are after large population declines are unknown. However, anecdotal evidence indicates that the populations in the Knysna, Swartvlei, and Keurbooms estuaries have increased in numbers since the 85% decline in population observed in 2003 (T. Meintjes pers. comm. 2010, P. Joubert pers. comm. 2010).<br/><br/>Overall, the wild population of <em>H. capensis</em> is inferred to have declined by at least 50% over the past 10 years. Pressures that led to earlier declines have not ceased and are likely increasing, and although unquantified recent declines have been documented.",Decreasing,"<em>Hippocampus capensis </em>currently is found in the Knysna, Swartvlei, and Keurbooms estuaries in South Africa.

This species is a very popular marine resource throughout most of its range and there is evidence of significant stock reductions. In Viet Nam, a stock decline of 58% was recorded over a period of five years, while in Taiwan reductions of 60% from 1993-2008 were reported, and annual catch reductions recorded also after the 1980s in China. This species also exhibits life history characteristics that predispose it to impacts from heavy exploitation, including longevity and late maturity. We assume that the population was higher before the period over which the declines were recorded. Therefore, the population declines over the past 39 years (three generations) is at least 50% based on the rapid declines recorded over shorter periods which are exacerbated by the intrinsic life history characteristics of <em>E. cardinalis.</em> It is therefore listed as Endangered under criterion A2bd. We recommend careful monitoring of this species and the consideration of additional management regulations.","<em>Evynnis cardinalis&#160;</em>is primarily distributed from 30 m to 60 m depth (Chen and Qiu 2005) but can occur to 100 m. This species is found over a wide range of bottom types, but is more common close to reefs or on rough bottoms. Small individuals are very common at some localities in shallow, sheltered bays; larger fish often occur in deeper water (Eggleston 1974).&#160;The maximum age for this species is ~30 years (Hou&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) and it has a maximum length of 40 cm TL (Eggleston 1974).&#160;<em>Evynnis cardinalis</em>&#160;grows rapidly in the first two years of life and attains maturity at around seven years of age (Ye 2004, Hou <em>et al</em>. 2008a), at a length of about 11.2 cm (Chen 1999).<br/><br/><em>Evynnis cardinalis</em> undertakes a seasonal migration in the Beibu Gulf, China, towards the northeastern part of the gulf in late autumn and winter. Spawning takes place in the spring and the recruits disperse widely in the gulf. Juveniles inhabit coastal waters.&#160;<br/><br/>Generation length for <em>E. cardinalis</em> is estimated to be approximately 13 years, using the following equation for a gonochoristic fish species: Generation length = Σxlxmx/Σlxmx","<em>Evynnis cardinalis</em>&#160;is threatened by overexploitation. This species has experienced significant population declines in the Beibu Gulf and the south Fujian and Taiwan bank fishing ground (Ye 2004, Chen and Qiu 2005a, Feng <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011). Values of spawning biomass per recruit (SBR) &lt;25% of unexploited levels indicate stock collapse, as defined in Griffiths (2000) for South African line-fish species. Spawning biomass per recruit for <em>E. cardinalis</em>&#160;in the Beibu Gulf has been estimated to be below 20% of unexploited levels, indicative of stock collapse. In Viet Nam, stocks have declined by 58% during 2001–2005 (Nguyễn 2006). This species constitutes 17.9% of the otter trawl and 8.6 (&lt;20 m) and 11.6% (21–30 m) of the pair trawl bycatch landings in northern Viet Nam waters (Son&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). In China, the annual catch decreased after the 1980s, indicating a strong decline in the numbers and biomass of older fishes (i.e., the spawning stock) (Ye 2004,&#160;Chen and Qiu 2005).","<em>Evynnis cardinalis</em> is more common in the southern part of its range and in northern Viet Nam and the South China Sea (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm. 2009). From 1993 the catch was recorded at 400 tonnes and in 2008 had declined to 150 tonnes in Taiwan (Liao pers. comm. 2009). There have been declines in the numbers and biomass of the spawning stock in China as well (Xia&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Tonkin, Viet Nam, this species is most abundant at depths from 30–50 m, and the stock density and biomass increases from shore to 50 m depth. A high variation in catch rates of this stock in all strata is also observed: mean catch rates estimated for the depth stratum of 50–100 m in 2001 and 2005 were respectively 15.5 kg/h and 1.7 kg/h. In general, the catch rate of this stock has decreased significantly from 28.8 kg/h (2001) to 11.1 kg/h (2005), with p &lt; 0.05. Corresponding to this decrease in catch rate, biomass of the stock has also declined considerably; the estimates of the stock biomass in 2001; 2003; 2004 and 2005 are 33,952 tonnes (CV= 16%); 12,150 tonnes (CV= 29%); 21,389 tonnes (CV= 23%) and 14,414 tonnes (CV= 34%), respectively. Therefore, during 2001–2005, this stock has declined by 58% (Nguyễn 2006). <br/><br/>The spawning biomass per recruit (SBR) of <em>E. cardinalis</em> in the Beibu Gulf is estimated to be 16.76% of its unfished level, indicating that the fishery is overfished and has also experienced recruitment failure (Feng <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Additional analysis suggests that SBR in the Beibu Gulf is 12.51% of the unexploited level (Feng <em>et al</em>. 2009a). The status of this stock was also assessed using the egg production per recruit model (EPR) which was estimated to be 15.49% of the unexploited level under the current fishing mortality rate, which also indicated that the fishery is over-fished (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011). The catch rates for&#160;<em>E. cardinalis</em>&#160;in the Beibu Gulf were found to be higher during winter and spring than in autumn and summer, with the highest catches from March to May. The catch rates of biomass were 10.27 kg/h and catch rates of &#160;individual numbers were to 700.9 ind/h (Chen and Qiu 2005). Data from trawl surveys in the Beibu Gulf indicate that the stock has annual variation with seasonal changes in catch rates caused by immigration during the spawning period and catch rates higher in March and May.

The proposed measures could restore SBR to 28.39% of the unfished level, increase yield per recruit (YPR) in mass up to 31.95% and prevent the fishery from collapsing. It is also recommended that fishing effort be reduced by 32.5% in order to attain a level of sustainable exploitation (Feng<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009). The closed fishing season was found to be most effective when implemented from July to August or September and would improve SBR and YPR considerably (Feng&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Similarly, a closed fishing season and larger length of capture would improve egg production per recruit (EPR). It is suggested that relevant fishing effort be reduced by 15.53% or to extend the age at capture to allow the EPR to reach at least 20% of the unexploited level (Wang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).

It has a widespread but patchy distribution in the Indo-West Pacific. The species is highly susceptible to a variety of fishing methods in regions where the level of exploitation of marine resources is intense and increasing (for example, India, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia). It is occasionally caught by the rhynchobatid gillnet fishery that operates in Southeast Asia. In the Gulf of Thailand, eagle rays are now extremely rare, and this may be representative of other areas where the Ornate Eagle Ray occurs. In Australian waters the fishing pressure would not be very high but it is rarely observed there. It is suspected to have limiting life history parameters similar to  other myliobatid rays, including low fecundity. The Ornate Eagle Ray is  assessed as Endangered due to suspected population declines exceeding 50% over the last three generations (45 years) as a result of very  high, ongoing (and increasing) levels of fishing pressure across the majority of its distribution.","The Ornate Eagle Ray is a little known species. It occurs on the inner continental shelf to depths of 110 m over soft sandy substrate (Compagno and Last 1999). It reaches a maximum size of 240 cm disc width (W. White, unpubl. data). Reproductive biology is unknown for this species but it is suspected to have low fecundity as with other myliobatids, which bear litters of up to four offspring (Compagno and Last 1999, Last and Stevens 2009). Age and growth estimates are not available, although generation length can be inferred as approximately 15 years based on parameters from the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>), which matures at five years and reaches a maximum age of 24 years (Martin and Cailliet 1988).","This eagle ray is highly susceptible to a variety of inshore demersal fisheries, including trawls, gillnets and trammel nets which operate intensively throughout its range (for example, India, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia). All individuals caught are retained in most areas. Local eagle ray species are marketed in considerable numbers in Thailand and Malaysia (Compagno and Last 1999). The Ornate Eagle Ray is occasionally landed in low numbers in the fish markets of Jakarta (Indonesia) by trawlers and is occasionally caught by the rhynchobatid gillnet fishery that operates in Southeast Asia (W. White, unpubl. data). Even though once common, eagle rays are now rare in the Gulf of Thailand (Compagno and Last 1999). Intensive demersal fisheries occur in India, within the species' known distribution (Hanfee 1999). There is very high level of exploitation across the habitat that this species occurs in throughout its range, with the exception of northern Australia.","The species appears to be naturally uncommon and is rarely observed.

It has a low fecundity (average two pups per litter) and a very low annual rate of population increase of 0.033. The species is caught as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The species is often retained for its meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high at-vessel mortality remains a threat even where retention is prohibited. The Pelagic Thresher is especially susceptible to fisheries exploitation because its epipelagic habitat occurs within the range of  many largely unregulated and under-reported, small-scale and artisanal gillnet and longline  fisheries, in which it is readily caught. The species is estimated to be declining in both the Pacific  and Indian Oceans. Across its Indo-Pacific distribution, the Pelagic Thresher is estimated to have reduced by 50–79% over  the last three generations (55.5 years), based on abundance data and  levels of exploitation, and therefore the species is assessed as  Endangered A2bd.</p>","The Pelagic Thresher is epipelagic and mesopelagic from the surface to  depths of 300 m (Weigmann 2016).&#160;It attains a maximum size of 365 cm total  length (TL), males and females mature at 250–300 cm TL  (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with oophagy, and a  litter size of only two, very large (158–190 cm TL) pups and the reproductive cycle is likely annual (Liu <em>et al. </em>1999). The potential annual rate of  population increase under sustainable fishing is thought to be very low  and has been estimated at 2–4% (Smith&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998), or 0.033 (i.e. 3.3%) (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008), compared with the Common Thresher, which is 4–7% (Smith <em>et al.</em> 1998) or 0.254 (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008). Female age-at-maturity varies from 9 to 13.2 years and maximum age from 24 to 28 years in Taiwan and Indonesia, respectively (Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Chen and Yuan 2006, Drew&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015); generation length is therefore 16.5 years in Taiwan, and 20.6 years in Indonesiaand Indonesia. Averaging these gives a generation length of 18.5 years which was used in this assessment.","<p>The Pelagic Thresher is caught as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al. </em>2015, Temple <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality that has been  estimated for the congener Common Thresher&#160;as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015). For commercial fisheries, at-vessel hooking mortality for the congener Bigeye Thresher is high with between 49 and 68% of individuals caught found to be dead on haulback (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, IOTC 2016).</p>  <p></p><p></p>","There are no data on the population size of the Pelagic Thresher. Genetic results indicate some genetic structuring between Eastern and Western Pacific, but it is unknown if there is any genetic structure between Indian and Pacific Oceans (Trejo 2005).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Pacific (Rice <em>et al.</em> 2015); and, nominal CPUE in the Indian Ocean (E. Romanov unpubl. data). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) observer <em>Alopias </em>species-complex standardized CPUE for 1996–2014 (19 years) was used to represent catches from the Pacific (Rice <em>et al.</em> 2015). The three thresher shark species, Pelagic Thresher, Bigeye Thresher (<em>A. superciliosus</em>), and Common Thresher (<em>A. vulpinus</em>), were combined by Rice <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) due to a lack of species-specific data. These data are most likely to comprise Pelagic Thresher and Bigeye Thresher as the Common Thresher is rarely recorded in the Pacific (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013, Clarke <em>et al. </em>2015, E.

The CPUE indicated a decline, particularly from 2010 to 2014 (Rice <em>et al. </em>2015). The trend analysis of the WCFPC standardized CPUE for 1996–2014 (19 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 71.5% over three generation lengths (55.5 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>From the same region, a demographic analysis of Pelagic Thresher off Taiwan, Northwest Pacific reported a projected stock reduction of 34.3% over 20 years (2007–2027), and that the stock is overexploited (Tsai <em>et al. </em>2010). This conclusion was consistent with a spawning-per-recruit analyses of the Pelagic Thresher off Taiwan that also found it to be overexploited (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Second, Indian Ocean Soviet research nominal CPUE for Pelagic Thresher from 1967–1987 (21 years) suggested an annual rate of decline of approximately 1% per year from 0.35 caught per 1,000 hooks to &lt;0.1 in 1987 (Romanov <em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;E. Romanov unpubl. data).

To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 74.5%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (55.5 years).

68612632,70680197,Carcharhinus dussumieri,Endangered,A2d+3d,2019,2018-08-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whitecheek Shark (<em>Carcharhinus dussumieri</em>)&#160;is a small-sized shark (to 100 cm total length) that occurs primarily in  the Western Indian Ocean from at least the Arabian/Persian Gulf to the southeastern coast  of India. It was common in inshore waters at depths to 100 m and is particularly susceptible to inshore fisheries. The species is  caught in commercial trawling, artisanal fishing, hook-and-line fishing, and gillnetting throughout its range. It has a  relatively low reproductive capacity (litters of 2-5 pups)  making it particularly susceptible to over-exploitation. The Whitecheek  Shark is often the dominant species landed in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (e.g. Iran and  Qatar). However, off Pakistan and India, where it used to be common,  there is evidence of declines exceeding 50-70% over the last 15 years  with recent surveys in India and Sri Lanka failing to report the species. It is suspected that localized extinctions have likely occurred in Indian  waters due to high levels of fishing pressure.&#160;The ongoing  intensification of fisheries across its range, combined with reported  declines of sharks in the region in general, lead to a suspected population decline of  at least 50-70% over the past three generations (12 years) and further  population reduction is suspected over the future three generation  lengths (2018-2030) based on current levels of exploitation. As such  this species is assessed as Endangered A2d+3d.","The Whitecheek Shark is a small species of carcharhinid shark that is  common in inshore waters over soft substrates at depths of 0-100 m  (Weigmann 2016).&#160;It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm total length (TL)  with&#160;males maturing at 72 cm TL and females at about 80 cm TL&#160;(Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Jabado&#160;<em>et al</em>.  2016). Size at birth is around 28-40 cm TL. The species is viviparous and produces litters of 2-5 pups (White 2012, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2012). The species is assumed to breed each year, based on the annual breeding of the closely-related Australian Blackspot Shark (<em>C. coatesi</em>) (Stevens and McLoughlin 1991). Age and growth data  are not available for this species, but generation length is suspected  to be around 4 years based on the Australian Blackspot Shark that has an estimated maximum age of 6.5 years and age at maturity of two years (Smart <em>et al. </em>2013).","There is little information on catches of the&#160;Whitecheek Shark&#160;as  species-specific data is not usually recorded.&#160;Carcharhinids are  susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types,  particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which  generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries across its range have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due  to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in  traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).  Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal  fishing effort and power in some parts of its range leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (Mohamed and Veena  2016).&#160;The Whitecheek Shark is taken in a variety of gear  including&#160;gillnet, longline, and bottom trawl fisheries.  The high level of exploitation in its habitat is of concern. For example, in India,  there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with  many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI  2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the  Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).  This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all  Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating. In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters,  targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M.  Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing  effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601  in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","To date, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for  this species.&#160;A Danish survey in 1937-38 recorded the Whitecheek Shark  as by far the most common species of shark in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (mostly Iranian  coast) (Blegvad and Løppenthin 1944), and it was also reported as common around Bahrain  in surveys carried out in 1974-78 (Herdson 1981). This species is  commonly caught in Iran where it is considered the most abundant species  (FAO 2009).&#160;Overall, it makes up about 60% of shark landings by number  in Iran (Arabian/Persian Gulf&#160;and Sea of Oman) and continues to be an important part of the  catch (T. Valinassab unpubl. data).&#160;This species also represented 22%  (in 2008) and 20% (in 2011) of elasmobranch landings by number in Kuwait, and 26% of elasmobranch landings by number in Qatar (Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).  In Bahrain, it represented almost 3% of elasmobranchs landed by number  (Moore and Peirce 2013). In the UAE, it makes up 4.5% of shark landings  by number (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2016) and &lt;1% of sharks traded from Oman to the UAE (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015).  Henderson and Reeve (2014) only report nine specimens of this species  landed from data collected over five years of landing site surveys along  the coast of Oman. In Pakistan, it was among the most common species  caught in gillnet fisheries in the 1980s but is currently uncommonly  encountered (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).&#160;In India, Raje<em> et al.</em>  (2002) reported Whitecheek Shark as one of the major species contributing  to Indian fisheries. In 2003-2004, 58 t were recorded from gillnet  fisheries along the southwest coast (Raje <em>et al. </em>2007).  However, the Whitecheek Shark was not observed in surveys of landings in  Porbandar (Gujarat), Sasoon Dock (Mumbai) and Malvan (Maharashtra)  undertaken in 2014-2015 (D. Sutaria pers. comm. to R.W. Jabado  06/02/2017). This species was also reported as one of the dominant species landed by various fishing gears along the coast of Tamil Nadu (southeast coast of India in the 1980s and 1990s; Raje<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2002)). However, more recent landing site surveys (2002-2006) along the eastern Indian coast (Chennai) failed to record it (Mohanraj <em>et al.</em> 2009). A decline in abundance of over 50-70% based on catch levels  has occurred in India (S. J. Kizhakudan pers. comm. to Akhilesh K.K.  06/02/2017). Similarly, this species has not been reported from over a year of landing site surveys along the coast of Sri Lanka (D. Fernando pers. comm. to R.W. Jabado 02/08/2018).<br/><br/>Fisheries across its range have experienced increased  demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a  result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many  areas (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).  Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in  the Arabian/Persian Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly  carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).  Historical surveys in the&#160;Arabian/Persian Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks  comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980-81, whereas in  2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Shark  catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000  mt to 9,000 mt and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite  increasing efforts (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India  indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already  collapsed&#160;(Mohamed and Veena 2016). While there is limited  species-specific information available on this species, it  is marketed for consumption across its range, and the presence of  intensive fisheries mean that like many other carcharhinids in the  region it has declined.<br/><br/>The abundance of this species appears to have  followed two different trends. In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, it remains an abundant  species dominating landings of many countries, however, in the Arabian  Sea greater fishing intensity has resulted in suspected declines of at  least 50-70% in some areas. With  increasing fishing pressure across the Arabian Seas region, it is  suspected that this species has declined by at least 50-70% over the  past three generations (~12 years) and that  these declines are likely to be ongoing.&#160;A further population reduction  is suspected over&#160;the next three generations (2018-2030) based on current  levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Whitecheek Shark<em>&#160;</em>is widespread along the north coast of the Arabian Sea and the Arabian/Persian Gulf in the Western and Eastern Indian Ocean (White 2012). It is more patchily distributed along the southwest coast of India but has been recorded from the northern coast of Sri Lanka (Gulf of Mannar) and the east coast of India (Tamil Nadu State to Pondicherry where it was first described) (Appukuttan and Nair 1988). Bonfil (2003) reported this species from  the lower Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, but these records may have been of  Human's Whaler Shark (<em>Carcharhinus humani</em>) which was only recently described from the northwest Indian Ocean (White and Weigmann 2014).","The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at  local markets across its range. In some countries, such as Oman, Saudi  Arabia (Arabian/Persian Gulf), Pakistan, and India the meat is cut into fillets, dried  and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries. Fins  are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded  internationally (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place.&#160;Many  countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks  (e.g. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other  fisheries.&#160;Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran (from  March to August) and the UAE (February to June). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman  have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993, and 2011,  respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have  seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species.&#160;However,&#160;incidental  catches occur in other fisheries (e.g.&#160;gillnetting) to which they are  more susceptible.<br/><br/>Research is needed to determine distribution,  population size, and trends in abundance to further assess status and any  future conservation needs.<br/><br/>Effective monitoring of fisheries is  required, as is the effective implementation and management of marine  protected areas.

It occurs on continental slopes at depths of 220–1,050 m, and is mostly reported at depths 350–800 m. During the 1970s to 2000, gulper sharks, including Harrisson’s Dogfish, were heavily exploited off the east coast of Australia by commercial trawl, longline, and targeted gillnet fisheries, resulting in &gt;99% decline in relative abundance of all gulper sharks. The species is now subject to a number of management and recovery measures in Australian waters, including gulper shark protection areas off New South Wales, South Australia, and eastern Bass Strait, and has been reported from areas where there are few to no fishing activities (e.g. Kermadec Ridge). However, given their slow life histories, even low levels of mortality can pose risk for the recovery of gulper shark populations.

Despite the current zero retention limit, some gulper sharks have been recorded in landings from trawl fisheries in the Commonwealth Trawl and Scalefish Hook sectors (0.5 and 0.35 t in 2016–17 and 2017–18 fishing seasons, respectively); these landings may be reporting errors, but misreporting or underestimation of discards is also plausible based on the degree of overlap with current fishing effort (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Given their slow life histories, even low levels of mortality can pose risk for the recovery of gulper shark populations.","<p>A fishery-independent trawl survey on the upper slope (200–650 m depth) off New South Wales (NSW) between the Sydney area (33°30’S) and the Eden-Gabo Island area (38°20’S) in 1996–97 found a &gt;99% decline in relative abundance of all gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) since the initial survey in 1976–77 (Graham&#160;<em>et al. </em>2001). In 2012, the overall depletion estimate (proportion of the population remaining) was calculated to be 21% (range 11-31%) with the estimate for the continental slope population 11% (4–20%) and seamount population 75% (50–100%) (AFMA 2012a,b). Assuming that the main population of this species is off eastern Australia (including adjacent seamounts and Lord Howe Island), it is likely that there is still some low-level fishing mortality in both the lightly-fished northern part of its range and the severely depleted southern part of its range, possibly resulting in a continuing slow decrease in the total population size.<br/><br/>A geographically comprehensive and targeted gulper shark survey using auto-longlines on the upper slope between Brisbane and Tasmania in 2009 caught 105 individuals off northern NSW with a mean catch rate of 3.3 dogfish per 1,000 hooks (Graham and Daley 2011). On the same survey, 12 individuals were caught at the Taupo Seamount (~200 nm off central NSW) at 4.0 dogfish per 1,000 hooks. This survey confirmed that numbers of this species remain low on regularly fished grounds between Sydney and Bass Strait (~0.4 dogfish per 1,000 hooks) and catches throughout this southern part of its range included no mature females. However, at three sites off Flinders Island that included areas closed to trawling (Daley&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2010), 85 Harrisson’s Dogfish were caught (6.3 dogfish per 1,000 hooks) suggesting that the protected areas are having a beneficial effect on population numbers. <br/><br/>With only two specimens known from New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone waters, and sporadic (nominal) records from the north Tasman and Coral Seas, there is no knowledge of the relative abundance of this dogfish outside Australian waters.<br/><br/>Based on documented declines and levels of exploitation,&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">a population reduction of 50–79% is inferred over the last three generations (89 years).

In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of the Leafscale Gulper Shark were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Portuguese Dogfish,&#160;<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>) in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;Since the introduction of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of zero in 2010, it is likely that discarding and misreporting of the species has increased (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;In 2014, 50% of sampled specimens collected from longliners and landed as the Tope Shark (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>)&#160;were found to be Leafscale Gulper Shark or Portuguese Dogfish (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998,&#160;there was an apparent increase in reported landings&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005, Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). Gulper sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and during the period 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has occurred off the Andaman Islands&#160;since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Leafscale Gulper Shark to have extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;</p>","<p>Population genetics indicate low genetic variability and migration of individuals between populations (Veríssimo<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2012), and a tagging study from the Northeast Atlantic showed the species is capable of large distance migrations and is highly migratory (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2014).<br/><br/>Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of gulper sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp). Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic and (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) (2) relative biomass in the Southwest Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths (94 years for the Indo-Pacific, 158&#160;years for the Northeast Atlantic) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary <a>Information</a>). <br/><br/>First, relative abundance estimates from Scottish trawl surveys suggest significant declines in nominal CPUE from 1998, but these appear to have stabilized and increased since 2012 (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019). The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of decrease of 2.9% consistent with an estimated decrease of&#160;98.3% over three generation lengths (158&#160;years), with the highest probability of&#160;&gt;80% reductions in population over the three generation lengths.&#160;In addition, commercial landings of deep-water dogfishes in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~11,000 t in 2003, before rapidly declining to 220 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES 2015).<br/><br/>Second, the trend analysis of relative biomass estimates from fisheries independent research trawl surveys&#160;off New Zealand (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2016), revealed an annual rate of increase of&#160;0.6%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;59.4% over three generation lengths (94 years), with the highest probability of&#160;no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. Furthermore, an indicator analysis using trawl survey data, industrial catch-effort, and observer data showed no trends in biomass, but indicated the species is poorly monitored on Chatham Rise (Francis&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016). In Australia, significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of gulper sharks&#160;(mainly&#160;<em>C. harrissoni</em>,&#160;<em>C. uyato</em>, and&#160;<em>C. moluccensis</em>) from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2001). The species, however, was only occasionally reported from the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), with a mean average catch of 33 kg between 2000–2006 (Walker and Gason 2007). In New Zealand, the Leafscale Gulper Shark is considered to have a relatively moderate sized population in New Zealand (Ford&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Leafscale Gulper Shark, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterized by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Off the Maldives, the gulper shark stock collapsed in the early 2000s due to targeted fishing, after only about 20 years of exploitation. Although time-series data are not available for catches or landings, there are figures for shark liver oil exports. These show a peak in 1982 soon after the fishery commenced followed by a general downwards trend until 1989, increases in 1990 and 1991, before a complete crash sometime thereafter as available data shows very low export figures for 1996 onward (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007, Ali 2015). The fishery has ceased and since 2010 there has been no shark fishing in the Maldives. In the Philippines, annual exports of shark liver oil show a similar trend, peaking in 1980 at 336 t, and declining to 45 t by 1993 (BFAR 2017). The fishery includes a number of shark species, including unidentified&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp (Flores 2004, BFAR 2017).<br/><br/>The gulper shark stock off India is suspected to have similarly collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing off western India. Gulper shark&#160;landings declined from 114 t in 2008 to 39 t in 2011 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), equating to a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generations (94 years).&#160;Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of gulper sharks&#160;declined from 18% to 1–14% between 1984–2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). In Sri Lanka, the targeted gulper shark fishery at Valaichchenai, which dates back to the 1980s, has seen a large reduction in effort, from 30 to 2 vessels, in recent years (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019). The rationale for this reduction in fleet is claimed to be self-regulation of the fishery, although lack of long-term economic and biological viability of the fishery is also suspected.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, data from a targeted demersal longline fishing for gulper sharks&#160;landed in the Tenau, East Nusa Tenggara documented a decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 145 kg/trip to 78 kg/trip between 2011–2014; the Leafscale Gulper Shark was found to account for 10–13% of the&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp catch (Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017).&#160;Total catch of dogfishes, a mixed category for more than 10 species, reported to the Indonesian&#160;National Shark Data Collection program&#160;decreased from&#160;16,536 t in 2005 to 4,820 t in 2016&#160;(DGCF, 2017). This equates to&#160;&gt;99% reduction in population over three generation lengths (94 years).&#160;</p><p>Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates between 1950–2014 for&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403173"">the Japan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shown declines of 98% (1,300 t to 14 t annually) (Zeller and Pauly 2016).</a>&#160;In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort (Swartz and Ishimura 2014) which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in Japan. Commercial captures of the species in Japan is unknown. In&#160;Okinawa waters, research surveys using drop line and demersal longline reported 355&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp across 125 hauls and 55 000 hooks, with the highest CPUE occurring in waters &gt;1,000 m (Yano and Kugai 1993). In 2003, a demersal trawl survey reported a CPUE of 1–6 individuals per tow caught between 500–1,000 m (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2007). These surveys have used different methods and are thus not comparable, but could indicate the species is found at low density in the region, or is found at depths beyond most fishing effort.&#160;In Taiwan, the species is reported in low numbers from deep-water fisheries (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013b).<br/><br/>The Leafscale Gulper Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for the Northeast Atlantic and Southwest Pacific were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 51.6%, with equal probability (30%) of &gt;80% reductions in parts of its range and no major reductions in others parts over three generation lengths (158 years). Trends are unavailable for &gt;50% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Leafscale Gulper Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Ocean (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013a).&#160;</p>","<p>Gulper shark liver oil, rich in squalene, is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities (K.K. Bineesh, unpubl. data). Oil may be processed locally or shipped overseas (e.g. Dubai) for processing before sold on the international market. High grade oil is exported to Japan and the European Union (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019, K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019, A. Tanna pers. comm., 21/11/19). Flesh is sold to local markets (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), while waste products from liver oil production is utilized as aquaculture and poultry feed (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). Gulper shark fins are of low value (Jaiteh&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016), but have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018).</p>",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Leafscale Gulper Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). The species is considered a ""key species of concern"" within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Leafscale Gulper Shark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus </em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). <br/><br/>In Australia, gulper sharks are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, comprising several&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, and Harrisson’s dogfish (<em>C. harrissoni</em>) and the Southern Dogfish (<em>C. uyato</em>) are listed as Conservation-Dependent under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Species are subject to recovery plans that specify management actions to halt fishing mortality and support recovery. A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018), may indirectly offer the species some refuge in this region.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is a slow growing species which reaches a maximum size of 186 cm total length, a maximum age of 21 years and has a generation length of 14 years. These life history parameters along with its apparent patchy localised distribution increases its susceptibility to depletion due to heavy fishing effort. Furthermore, its morphology makes it extremely susceptible to entanglement in a wide variety of nets.<br/><br/>Throughout the majority of its range, in particular Asia, fishing effort is concentrated in coastal regions, is intense and is generally unregulated; the Winghead Shark is inferred to have been heavily exploited. This species is now rarely encountered in both India and Indonesia where it has previously been reported, and the absence of the species from fish market and landing surveys in these countries is likely to accurately reflect the situation more broadly across the majority of its range. While there are no species-scientific data on its status, the population is inferred to have declined by at least 50% within the equivalent of three generations (42 years) and hence it is assessed as Endangered globally based on heavy exploitation levels.&#160;As fishing practices across most of its range are expected to remain unchanged in terms of intense pressure in nearshore waters, it is inferred that the global population will continue to decline at a similar rate over the next three generations. In Australia, the Winghead Shark is only a small component of commercial catches, therefore the population is considered to be relatively healthy and is regionally assessed as Least Concern.","The Winghead Shark occurs on the continental shelves and is mainly found in coastal nearshore waters. In eastern Australia, this species is mainly encountered in concentrated areas of less than 50 km²<sup> </sup>(J. Smart, pers. obs. 2015).&#160;This species is familiar to local fishers within these concentrated areas and is seldom encountered by fishers further away, thereby suggesting a patchy localised distribution. This is however, based on local ecological knowledge as there is little additional survey data. One tag recapture has been confirmed from northern Australia with this individual re-caught within 21 km of the original capture location after 12 months (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>Young are born at approximately 45 cm total length (TL), maturity occurs at around 120 cm TL for females and 108 cm TL for males, and they reach a maximum size of 186 cm TL (Stevens and Lyle 1989).  Mature females produce litters of 6–25 (mean = 11) every year after a gestation period of 8 to 11 months (Compagno 1984, Stevens and Lyle 1989). This is a slow growing species that reaches maturity at 7.2 years for females and 5.5 years for males. The oldest documented maximum age is 21 years according to vertebral analysis (Stevens and Lyle 1989, Smart<em> et al.</em> 2013). Generation length is estimated to be 14 years.","The Winghead Shark&#160;is heavily exploited in many parts of its range, for example the Gulf of Thailand, India and Indonesia (Simpfendorfer 2003). Only one individual was seen in market surveys in Indonesia during which approximately 20,000 sharks were recorded. It is therefore suspected to be severely overfished in this country as most of Indonesia's fishing effort is focused on coastal nearshore areas where it would be suspected to inhabit (W. White, CSIRO, pers. comm. 2015). Recent catch data from India identifies sharks to species level and has no mention of the Winghead Shark&#160;as a bycatch or byproduct species (e.g. Varghese <em>et al. </em>2013). Severe population declines are therefore also suspected as they&#160;have previously been recorded there. This pattern is expected throughout the species' Asian range where fishing pressure on nearshore regions is intense and generally unregulated.<br/><br/>Within Australia, the Winghead Shark is lightly exploited in several net fisheries. Its elongated hammer-shaped head makes it susceptible to a wide range of mesh sizes and therefore it is predominantly caught in gillnets and trawls. However, it is only caught in low numbers in the Queensland East Coast Finfish Fishery (0.4% of total catch; Harry <em>et. al</em> 2011), Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Finfish Fishery (&lt;0.3% of total catch; DAFF 2012), Northern Prawn Fishery (0.02% of total catch; Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002) and the Pilbara Trawl Fishery (Western Australia Department of Fisheries 2010).<br/><br/>The greatest catches of the Winghead Shark&#160;in Australia are taken in the&#160;Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery and has ranged between&#160;10.942 t and 21.356 t between 2007 and 2012. Due to operational changes in the fishery, however, this catch has decreased to&#160;12.786 t in 2012 and this trend is likely to continue (Grant Johnson, NT Fisheries, pers. comm., 2015).","There are no species-specific data available on population numbers, and how they have changed over time, for any part of the range. Globally, however, shark and ray landings have declined by at least 20% since 2003, but the Indo-Pacific is amongst the regions where this decline has been more severe (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines in the Winghead Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). Furthermore, the extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are another key threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Australian waters, this species makes up a very small proportion of catches in tropical gillnet fisheries (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and its population is not believed to have declined substantially.",Decreasing,The Winghead Shark occurs on and near continental shelf waters of the Indo-West Pacific from the Arabian/Persian Gulf through south Asia to northern Australia and Papua New Guinea (Last and Stevens 2009).,"The Winghead Shark has been heavily exploited for fins and meat across the vast majority of its range, with the exception of Australia, where, while still utilized, exploitation rates are much lower.",Marine,There are currently no species-specific management measures in place for the Winghead Shark.

Within this broad range, aggregations are sparsely distributed&#160;and while individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently and exhibit a degree of philopatry resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion.&#160;The global population size is not known, but local and regional abundance has been estimated and is mostly small, numbering less than&#160;500 individuals, except for Ecuador where abundance is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals.&#160;The species has an extremely slow life history, producing only 1 pup on average every 4–5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) of any elasmobranch. Giant Manta Rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale tuna fisheries. The meat is consumed locally, and the species is traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. Where Giant Manta Ray are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. Elsewhere, however, very rapid declines have been noted in&#160;sightings records and landings where they are targeted or caught as bycatch; these range from 71 to 95% declines over 13- to 21-year periods (all less than one generation length of 29 years). It is suspected that the Giant Manta Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three  generation lengths (87 years), with further population reduction  suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2105) due to current and ongoing levels of exploitation, and a reduction in area of occupancy due to suspected  local and regional extinctions, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd+A3d.","<p>The Giant Manta Ray is a neritic and oceanic pelagic ray that occurs in places&#160;with regular upwelling along  coastlines, oceanic islands, and offshore pinnacles and seamounts  (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The Giant Manta Ray can exhibit diel  patterns in habitat use, moving inshore during the day to clean and  socialize in shallow waters, and then moving offshore at night to feed  to depths of 1,000 meters (Hearn&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Burgess 2017). It can spend long periods of time offshore without visiting shallow coastal waters (Stewart&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, A. Marshall unpubl. data 2019). The Giant Manta Ray may be the largest living ray species attaining a maximum size of 700 cm disc width (DW) with anecdotal reports up to 910 cm DW (Compagno 1999, Alava <em>et al. </em>2002). Males mature at 350<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>400 cm DW and females mature at 380<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>500 cm DW (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Last<em> et al.</em> 2016, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a single large pup of 122<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>200 cm DW (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproductive periodicity is unknown, but assumed to be 4<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>5 years, similar to the closely related Reef Manta Ray (<em>M. alfredi</em>). Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 8.6 years of age but first pregnancy may be delayed by up to 4 years (making first age of pregnancy 12 years) depending upon food availability (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). The maximum age is estimated as 45 years, based on the longevity of the Reef Manta Ray; generation length is therefore estimated as 29 years. Based on this life history, the maximum intrinsic rate of population  increase could range between 0.019 and 0.046 per year (median 0.032 per  year) (J. Carlson unpubl. data 2019, following methods in Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2014). The species is among the longest-living rays and has an extremely conservative life history; the  average Giant Manta Ray may produce only 4–7 pups during its estimated  lifespan, which would contribute to its slow recovery from population reductions due to over-exploitation or other threats.</p>","<p>  </p><p>Mobulid rays, including the Giant Manta Ray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gill nets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Manta rays are also caught in bather protection nets (Cliff and Dudley 2011, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries 2018).  Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate,  makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine  and longline fisheries and targeted capture in artisanal fisheries (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Duffy and Griffiths  2017). In particular, Giant Manta Rays are easy to target because of  their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate, predictable habitat  use, and lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/></p>  <p>Mobula rays, including Giant Manta Rays, are caught in at least 13  targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries. Some of the largest  documented fisheries have been in Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Sri  Lanka, México, Taiwan, Mozambique, Palestine (Gaza strip), and Peru (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013, Croll<em> et al</em>. 2016), where sometimes thousands of manta rays are landed per annum (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dewar 2002, White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Lewis<em> et al.</em>  2015). While many artisanal fisheries have grown to meet international trade demand for gill plates,  some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Essumang 2010, Rohner <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p><p>Mobula rays, including Giant Manta Rays, are caught incidentally as  bycatch throughout their ranges in at least 21 small scale fisheries in  15 countries and 9 large-scale fisheries in 11 countries (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016).  Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically retained because of their high trade value. Even when discarded alive, e.g. from tuna purse seine fisheries, they are  often injured and have high post-release mortality  (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017).&#160;Many  fisheries remain open and active even after dozens of national fishing  bans and international listings on the appendices of both Convention for  the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora  and Fauna (CITES) (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018). </p><p>Global landings of mobulid species, including Giant Manta Ray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, O’Malley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, total landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not landed elsewhere') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009). This  equates to an average of 1,593 metric t being landed per annum with this average increasing to 4,462 metric t per annum from 2008 to 2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019); reported  landings are likely to estimate only a fraction of total fishing-related  mortality (Ward-Paige<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/></p><p></p>  <p>  </p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). The source locations for the largest   amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Vietnam   (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017). Demand   for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from   60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). <br/></p><p>In the Western Indian Ocean, Romanov (2002) estimated that between 253 and 539 manta rays and devilrays were  being caught per year as bycatch in purse seine fisheries, and between  2003 and 2007, 35 manta rays were observed in  purse seine bycatch, most of which were likely Giant Manta Ray (Amandè <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Western and Central Pacific, from 2010<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2015,  observed bycatch of Giant Manta Rays in purse seine fisheries was 4,176  individuals, and in  longline fisheries was 226 individuals (based on  distribution, some of these were likely Giant Manta Ray<em></em>)  (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer, 2016). While a few individuals were  released in good condition, post-release mortality is likely to be high  as most were released alive but injured, or dead (Francis and Jones  2017). The Eastern Pacific purse seine fisheries show a substantial   increase in the bycatch of mobulid rays, including Giant Manta Rays,   from 20 tonnes per year before 2005 to 150 tonnes per year by  2006,  which then reduced to 10 tonnes per year by 2009 (Hall and Roman  2013).  The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) purse seine   vessels operating from 1993<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2015 reported an average catch of   approximately&#160;135 Giant Manta Rays per year (Miller and Klimovich 2017).   A&#160;susceptibility analysis indicated that negative interactions with   fishing gear and unintended mortality will continue to be an issue with   this species as these fisheries coincide with high productivity areas   where Giant Manta Rays are likely to aggregate for feeding (Duffy and   Griffiths 2017, Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>While the overwhelming cause of population reduction is fishing mortality, sublethal effects and lower levels of mortality occur from numerous lesser threats, such as entanglement in nets, recreational foul hooking, and vessel strikes (Marshall and Bennett 2010, Deakos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Couturier<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). While there is no direct evidence, there are concerns for effects of climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other forms of pollution and contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018). Furthermore, shallow water lagoon nursery habitats are subject to habitat loss and degradation that pose threats to juvenile Giant Manta Rays (Stewart<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p>","<p>The global population size of the Giant Manta Ray is difficult to assess, but abundance trajectories have been estimated based on long time series of sightings at diving sites. Generally, divers encounter the Giant Manta Ray less frequently than the Reef Manta Ray (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>) and this is thought to be due to their more oceanic habitat preferences and behaviour. Locally, abundance varies substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they were, or are currently, being fished. In most regions, Giant Manta Ray population sizes appear to be small (less than 1,000 individuals). Photo-identification studies at specific aggregation sites have yielded minimum estimates of 42 to 500 individuals over almost a decade of monitoring in most locations, including: Mozambique, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), Japan (Kashiwagi <em>et al.</em> 2010), Brazil (Luiz <em>et al.</em> 2008), and Mexico (Rubin 2002). A 6-year study has catalogued more than 2,000 individuals in a single site, off mainland Ecuador (Holmberg and Marshall 2018).</p>  <p>Giant Manta Ray aggregation sites are widely separated and the lack of genetic substructuring indicates occasional large-scale movements have occurred. Crossing referencing of regional photo-identification databases has not detected inter-region individual movements (e.g. across ocean basins) (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), indicating a low degree of interchange between ocean basins. Unlike the Reef Manta Ray, no significant genetic substructuring has been detected within the Giant Manta Ray (Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Hosegood&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).  Long-term studies, including those which have incorporated telemetry,  have shown low resighting rates but a degree of philopatry. <br/></p>  <p>The trend of the number of individuals varies widely across the range of the Giant Manta Ray, but trends appear stable where they are protected and declining rapidly where fishing pressure is greater. The sighting trends appear stable where they receive some level of protections, such as Hawaii (Ward-Paige <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Ecuador (Holmberg and Marshall 2018), although individuals sighted in Ecuador seasonally migrate to Peru (A. Marshall unpubl. data 2019) where directed  fishing occurs (Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Elsewhere, the number of individuals is likely to be declining in places where the species is targeted or caught regularly as bycatch. There are<strong> </strong>two estimates based on sightings-per-unit-effort. In southern Mozambique, a 94% decline in diver sighting records occurred over a 15-year period in a well-studied population (Rohner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). In Cocos Island, Costa Rica there has been an 89% decline in diver sighting records of Giant Manta Rays over a 21-year period (White<em> et al. </em>2015). These steep declines have occurred in less than one generation length (29 years).</p>Along with these sightings data, it is suspected (based on historical sightings, distribution data, and habitat suitability), that the Giant Manta Ray may have been depleted in areas where significant fisheries or threats  for manta rays exist, such as the west coast of mainland Mexico (Booda  1984, Rubin 2002), Madagascar, Tanzania (Bianchi 1985), Kenya, Somalia, Pakistan (Nawaz and  Khan 2015, Moazzam 2018), India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In these densely populated and heavily fished countries, fishing pressure may have more swiftly depleted resident populations of Giant Manta Rays. <br/><br/>There are narratives consistent with rapid local depletion<em>, </em>and disappearance of manta rays, particularly in Indonesia. In Lamakera, eastern Indonesia, increasing international trade demand for manta ray products in the 1990s resulted in increased fishing effort with up to 2,400 manta and devilrays landed per year. Consequently, manta ray catches (including Giant Manta Ray) declined sharply in this region, forcing fishers to travel further afield to find manta rays (Dewar 2002). Furthermore, landings of <em>Manta </em>spp. (including Giant Manta Ray which was the main target) continued to decline in Lamakera despite increased effort, with a reduction in landings of 75% over a 13-year period from 2001<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2014 leading to possible local extinction of <em>Manta </em>spp. from Lamakera (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Landings of <em>Manta</em> spp. also declined significantly during the same 13-year period in two other regions in Indonesia where effort also increased: Tanjung Luar (Lombok) (95% declines) and Cilicap (Central Java) (71% declines) (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). Aggregations of manta rays have entirely disappeared from three other locations within Indonesia, that is Lembeh Strait, South Sulawesi and Northwest Alor, with the cause strongly suspected as targeted and bycatch fishing (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). In East Flores and Lembata, Indonesia, manta rays (including the Giant Manta Ray) had historically been fished by  indigenous villagers&#160;since 1959, with up to 360 individuals caught a year (Barnes  2005). By 2001, less than 10 manta rays had been seen per year for the  previous 6-year period (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In the Bohol Sea, Philipines, manta rays (including Giant Manta Rays) were targeted for over a century with landings estimated to have declined since the 1960s by 50<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>90%, despite increasing fishing effort (Alava<em> et al. </em>2002). Concern for the species led to a ban on targeting of Giant Manta Rays in the Philippines in 1998, yet other <em>Mobula </em>species could still be targeted and Giant Manta Ray continued to be caught (Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2017, all targeted <em>Mobula</em> fisheries in the Bohol Seas were banned, yet <em>Mobula </em>species may still be taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries in the Bohol Sea (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).   Declining trends in the abundance and body size of mobulid fisheries landings  occurred both in India&#160;and Sri Lanka (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Pillai  1998, Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Raje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In Papua New Guinea, local declines have been noted and are attributed to fishing pressure (Rose 2008). Unspecified manta rays (some of which, based on distribution records, were likely Giant Manta Rays) were caught as non-target species in purse seine sets from 1995<a name=""_Hlk43804599""> </a>to 2006. There was a distinct and significant rise in the number of manta rays caught in these fisheries in 2001, which steadily rose until 2005/2006 when sharp declines were noted in the catch (Rose 2008).&#160; <br/><br/>    Although sparse, the available data suggest that localized populations of the Giant Manta Ray have been rapidly depleted by target fisheries in some regions and that local extinction is suspected to have occurred in many parts of their historical range. Globally, the suspected population reduction is 50<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>79% over three generation lengths (87 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018<a name=""_Hlk43804599"">–</a>2105), based on current and ongoing threats and exploitation levels, steep declines in monitored populations, and a reduction in area of occupancy. In the few places where manta rays are protected, the number of individuals is stable.",Decreasing,"The Giant Manta Ray is circumglobal in tropical and temperate waters from the surface to 1,000 m depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","<p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier<em> et al. </em>2012). The gill plates fetch high prices in Asia and are used for  Chinese health tonics (O’Malley<em> et al.</em> 2017). The meat from mobulids is  often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin of  mobulids is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and  knife handles). Giant Manta Rays are sometimes caught and transported to aquariums for  use in display tanks. Some of these captive animals have been released  into the wild.</p>  <p><br/></p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p>The Giant Manta Ray is protected in over a dozen countries and territories (Lawson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018, Booth <em>et al.</em> 2020). Local, national, and territory-level restrictions and/or protections for manta rays are currently in place in the USA (Hawaii), Australia and its territories, the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates, the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap), Thailand, Mozambique, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Even with legislative protection in some areas, fisheries for manta ray persist in others and there are more locations still where they are incidentally captured as bycatch in artisanal as well as small and large fisheries.&#160;With little to no effort to monitor or regulate mobulid fisheries in many countries, these current paper regulations are proving inadequate and misleading.</p><p>Manta rays have been listed in the appendices of a number of international conventions. The Giant Manta Ray was listed on Appendix I and II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 2011, however, many CMS Parties have inadequate protections (Lawson and Fordham 2018). As a threatened species whose wide-ranging migratory tendencies put it at risk, this listing acknowledges the fact that this species would benefit from the implementation of cooperative international agreements to manage and protect its populations and encourages range states to work together toward this goal.<em> Manta </em>species (i.e., including Giant Manta Ray) were listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2013, requiring fishing states to legitimize all exports through a permitting system based on non-detrimental findings which delimit acceptable, sustainable catches. <br/></p><p>Some Regional Fishing Management Organizations (RFMOs) have formally prohibited the retention of manta rays as bycatch, however most regulatory systems doing an inadequate job of protecting mobulids  from fishing mortality. <em></em>In 2015, recognizing the threatened status of mobulids, including the Giant Manta Ray,<strong> </strong>IATTC adopted recommendations which prohibited retaining, trans-shipping, landing, storing or selling, in whole or in part, any species of <em>Mobula</em> and required going forward that all mobulids be promptly released alive under strict non-detrimental protocols (Lawson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lawson and Fordham 2018). Since then IOTC (2019), have adopted similar recommendations, and the WCPFC will adopt similar conservation measures in January 2021.

The population has undergone a major reduction from the effects of fishing in some localities and is now rare in New South Wales, eastern Victoria, and Tasmania.&#160;There has been a documented decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in some areas that equates to a &gt;99% population reduction over the past three generations (63 years). However, the CPUE trend is affected by changes in targeting in the multi-species fishery and may not be a true indicator of changes in population abundance of Greeneye Spurdog. Furthermore, in the western parts of the species' range there are comparatively high abundances. The species has low biological productivity based on late age at maturity and low reproductive output. The combined effects of overall reductions in fishing intensity since 2006 on the continental slope throughout southeastern Australia, a low combined Total Allowable Catch for all deepwater dogfishes, and a network of refugia across the region are expected in time to rehabilitate the population, but this may take several decades. The dramatic declines in catches, which in some areas may be partly explained by a change in targeting, combined with the comparatively high abundance in other parts of the distribution, lead to an overall suspected population reduction<em> </em>of<em> </em>50–75% over the past three generations (63 years) based on actual levels of exploitation and a long history of fishing. The Greeneye Spurdog is thus assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>  <p></p>  <span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><p></p></span>","<p>  </p><p>The Greeneye Spurdog is demersal on the upper to mid-continental slope at depths of 216–1,360 m (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). It was most commonly captured from depths of 300–500 m in fisheries that operate primarily at 120–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). Females reach a larger size than males at 99.0 cm total length (TL) compared to 85.6 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007, Rochowski&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015). Length at which 50% are mature is 79.9 cm TL for females, and 62.9 cm TL for males; length at which 50% are maternal is 82.5 cm TL; size at birth is 25 cm TL, with litter sizes of 4–15, increasing with maternal length; the maternal breeding cycle is triennial (Rochowski<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015). Age estimates indicate a maximum age of at least 26 years for females and 24 years for males; females are estimated to mature at 16 years and males, depending on the method applied, at 9–12 years (Rochowski 2014). The generation length based on female age at maturity and longevity is 21 years.</p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p><a name=""_Hlk522103997"">Most of the geographic range of this species has previously been intensively fished but not the complete depth range; the majority of fishing has been at depths less than 600 m (Walker and Gason 2007) which would have provided some refuge for the Greeneye Spurdog in deeper waters. In the western part of the species' distribution in the Great Australian Bight (GAB), the trawl fishery operates mostly on the top of the continental shelf rather than the deeper slope regions, and the fishing pressure on the Greeneye Spurdog has been less intensive in that area. The current fishing effort in the GAB is mostly low (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual catch for the period 2000–06 estimated by combining monitoring data from scientific on-board observers and mandatory catch and effort returns submitted by commercial fishing operators was 212 t. This catch was taken by demersal trawl (89%), automatic longline (7%), and other methods (4%), with 95% of the catch taken from depths less than 600 m and 5% of the catch from depths greater than 600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). Since 2006, management measures have been implemented (see Conservation section) that have markedly reduced the high fishing intensity threat to the species.</a></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk522103179"">Over a 20 year period (1976/77 to 1996/97), fisheries-independent trawl surveys&#160;on upper-slope grounds (220</a>–<a name=""_Hlk522103179"">605 m&#160;depth) between the Sydney (central New South Wales, NSW) and Eden-Gabo Island (southern NSW/northern Victoria) area reported documented declines of&#160;~97% of ""greeneye dogsharks"" (Graham<em> et al.</em> 2001). </a><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) during 1976‒77 varied widely such that abundance off Sydney (92.4 kg/h) was much higher than areas further south off Ulladulla (21.8 kg/h), which in turn was much higher than off Eden (7.5 kg/h).<span class=""apple-converted-space""> It<span class=""apple-converted-space""> is now known that&#160;Greeneye Spurdog,<em> </em>Philippine Spurdog<em> </em>(<em>Squalus montalbani</em>),<em> </em>and<em> </em>Eastern Longnose Spurdog (<em>Squalus grahami</em>)<span class=""apple-converted-space""> were all caught during these surveys (K.

A more recent fishery-independent survey in 2009 using longlines and underwater baited-stereo-video cameras also found an absence of Greeneye Spurdog from the same areas (McLean <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 1996<a name=""_Hlk522104071"">–</a>2006 analyses, abundance of the species tended to rise westwards from western Victoria to South Australia and the Great Australian Bight (Walker and Gason 2007). Across the species' entire distribution, levels of relative abundance varied widely, indicative of localized depletion and comparatively high abundance in other areas (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>Walker and Gason (2007) standardized for the effects of year, month, latitude, longitude, and depth, but could not standardize for changes in targeting, which is a potential issue for Greeneye Spurdog. Following the mid-1990s, targeting on the upper-slope and mid-slope was redirected from Gemfish (<em>Rexea solandri</em>) to other species, including deepwater dogfish and Blue Grenadier (<em>Macruronus novaezelandiae</em>). These changes in targeting partly explain the rise, and then fall in Greeneye Spurdog CPUE for the south coast of Australia from Kangaroo Island to Cape Otway at 120–800 m; standardized CPUE (kg/km) was 4.10 in 1996, decreased to 1.96 in 1997, increased to 7.26 in 1999, before subsequently declining to 3.23 in 2000, and then to 0.20 in 2004. This equates to a &gt;99% reduction in Greeneye Spurdog over three generations (63 years). Changes in targeting influenced the patterns in Greeneye Spurdog as dogfish targeting appears to have been redirected to Piked Spurdog (<em>Squalus megalops</em>) by 2004. <br/><br/>Overall,&#160;the dramatic declines in catches, which in some areas may be partly explained by a change in targeting, combined with the comparatively high abundance in other parts of the distribution, lead to a suspected global population reduction&#160;of&#160;50‒75% over the past three generations (63 years) based on actual levels of exploitation and a long history of fishing within its range<span

It has a restricted distribution in shallow inshore waters at depths of 5-50 m with an estimated extent of occurrence of ~40,000 km² (the previous assessment underestimated this at &lt;5,000 km²). Stingarees have limited biological productivity (annual or biennial reproductive cycles with small litter sizes).&#160;The Coastal Stingaree is considered sparsely-distributed with low abundance. During trawl surveys in the Spencer Gulf in 2007, the species was recorded at 11 sites (14 individuals) while during surveys in 2013, only a single individual was recorded. The 2007 surveys, however, consisted of 120 sites, whereas the 2013 surveys consisted of 65 sites; a decrease in records was therefore expected. Nonetheless, the recording of only a single individual in 2013 is of concern. During both surveys, the Coastal Stingaree was only recorded at sites with low trawling intensity, which might indicate that it cannot sustain trawling pressure.&#160;The South Australian Prawn Fisheries operate over about half of the known range of the Coastal Stingaree. Commercial prawn trawling in South Australia commenced in the 1960s and historically, fishing pressure has been intense in parts of this fishery, particularly in the Spencer Gulf. Based on the overlap between the species' distribution and South Australian trawl fisheries, the long history of trawling within its range, its likely low productivity, and its occurrence only at sites of low trawling intensity, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;50% over the last three generations (27 years), and is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>The Coastal Stingaree&#160;has been recorded from inshore waters of the continental shelf at depths of 5-50 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~31 cm total length (TL); male maturity is ~23 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009). Like other urolophids, it is likely to have low fecundity (as low as 1-2 pups/year) (White<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em>. 2001, Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2016). Age data are not available for this species, but data from the Lobed Stingaree (<em>Urolophus lobatus</em>) from White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2001) can be used to estimate a generation length of 9 years.&#160;</p>","The range of the Coastal Stingaree is outside of fishing grounds of the Great Australian Bight Trawl Sector of the&#160;Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), although there is some overlap with the Commonwealth Trawl Sector at the eastern edge of its range (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>The South Australian Prawn Fisheries operate over about half of the known range of the Coastal Stingaree (PIRSA 2017). These are the Spencer Gulf Prawn Fishery (30 licences), Gulf St. Vincent Prawn Fishery (10 licences), and West Coast Prawn Fishery (3 licences) (PIRSA 2010, 2014, 2017). Commercial prawn trawling in South Australia commenced in the 1960s and historically, fishing pressure has been intense in parts of this fishery, particularly in the Spencer Gulf.&#160;The Coastal Stingaree was recorded as a bycatch of the Spencer Gulf Prawn Fishery by Burnell <em>et al.</em> (2015), but given overlap between all three fisheries and the species' geographic and depth, it is suspected to be a bycatch in all of these fisheries.&#160;<br/><br/>Where the species is taken as bycatch, a concern is the demonstrated low post-release survivorship of trawl caught stingarees (Campbell <em>et al. </em>2018), and the fact that urolophids frequently abort pups upon capture and handling; even if gravid females survived capture, their reproductive output can be lost (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Trinnie&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Adams&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).","No data are available on population size and structure of the Coastal Stingaree, although it is considered sparsely-distributed with low abundance (Walker 2004, Last <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Given its restricted distribution which overlaps with trawl fishing, spatial management may be key to securing the species. Habitat use and movement/residency patterns are unknown for this species, thus it is difficult to assess the benefits of South Australia's inshore marine park network (National Parks South Australia 2018) with regards to the Coastal Stingaree. Research is needed to focus on these aspects of the species' ecology in order to establish effective management and conservation measures. Bycatch monitoring and mitigation are a priority.&#160;<br/><br/>South Australian prawn trawl fisheries are managed by traditional measures such as limited entry, vessel and gear restrictions as well as seasonal closures and rotation of trawling grounds. The use of hoppers to sort the catch reduces handling time of bycatch and can increase survival of discards (PIRSA 2014).",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The Maugean Skate is only recorded from Macquarie and Bathurst Harbours on the west coast of Tasmania in Australia; these may represent two distinct subpopulations. The Maugean Skate is assessed as Endangered due to its small geographic range, presence in only two locations, and a continuing decline in quality of habitat. The extent of occurrence (EOO) is &lt;1,900 km² and the area of occupancy (AOO) is &lt;300 km². One location (Macquarie Harbour) is facing increasing human activity, which  is projected to lead to a decrease in EOO, AOO and quality of habitat due to increasing pressures from fish-farming and pollution. Macquarie Harbour currently has anoxic conditions, particularly in the depth range where the eggs are found (20-50 m), and these conditions are continuing.&#160;Habitat conditions will need to improve in order for this species not to qualify for a higher threat category in the future.&#160;The second subpopulation (Bathurst&#160;Harbour) has not been verified in approximately 20 years, despite dedicated surveys,&#160;and may be locally extinct.","The Maugean Skate is a medium-sized skate (to ~84 cm total length (TL)) and is unique among skates in that it is found only in brackish water (Last and Stevens 2009). The estuarine systems in which it lives are high in tannin content, with low light penetration and silty bottoms, resulting in the encroachment of several deepwater invertebrate species into relatively shallow depths. The morphology of this skate resembles that of <em>Dipturus</em> species found on the continental slope (Last and Stevens 1994).&#160;Males mature at ~65 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009) but little else is known of the biological or ecological requirements of this species. Specimens have been caught in a broad range of brackish salinities to almost freshwater (P. Last, pers. obs.). Eggs are deposited at depths of 20-50 m (N. Barrett, pers. comm. 2015).","Both subpopulations of this skate are in scenic and important recreational areas facing increasing pressure from ecotourism (Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2010). They are also regularly caught by recreational and commercial gillnetting in Macquarie Harbour (Lyle <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Macquarie Harbour is an estuary heavily polluted by prolonged mining operations. A recently rapid expansion of fish-farming has also coincided with considerable reduction in water quality, including extreme hypoxic conditions beyond 15 m depth (Anon. 2014), the habitat used by the skate for egg deposition. Persistent water quality issues could drastically reduce breeding success over coming years and could be catastrophic for this population. It is estimated that due to the hypoxic conditions at least one full year class has been lost, with others expected (N. Barrett, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>The isolation of Bathurst Harbour in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area affords some habitat protection for this species. Unfortunately, there are rising anthropogenic stressors including boating, fishing, dive tourism, introduced species, global climate change, nutrient enrichment, and onshore development (Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2010). Of great concern is the lack of sightings of this species in Bathurst Harbour in the last twenty years, despite dedicated survey efforts, indicating that the population may be locally extinct there (Treloar <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The total population size has previously been estimated at &lt;1,000 individuals (P. Last, pers. obs.). A recent tagging study of the Macquarie Harbour subpopulation (unpublished), combined with reports of the species being commonly captured by recreational and commercial gillnetting, suggests this may be a significant underestimate (N. Barrett, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Concerns for the Macquarie Harbour population remain, in part due to the species primarily utilizing the shallow waters (5-15 m depths) of the harbour (Lyle <em>et al</em>. 2014), where it is most likely to be caught by netting. The harbour is heavily stratified, with water dramatically increasing in salinity between 3 and 10 m, depending on the time of year, whereas the waters below 15 m have low dissolved oxygen (Anon. 2014). These physical parameters likely restrict the species to a narrow depth band within the harbour. Recent reductions in water quality in the harbour between 2009 and 2014, primarily increasingly anoxic conditions below 15 m (Anon. 2014), further restrict the species to this narrow band of ~5-15 m. This time period coincides with a dramatic expansion of salmon aquaculture in the harbour. Declining water quality at depth is of greater concern for breeding success of this species. The Maugean Skate deposits egg cases in the deeper waters of the harbour (Treloar <em>et al</em>. 2013), and the recent reduction in quality of these waters have potential to negatively impact breeding success over coming years.<br/><br/>There have been no confirmed sightings of the species at the second location, Bathurst Harbour, in the past 20 years, despite dedicated survey efforts (Treloar <em>et al</em>. 2013). This is of great concern, especially given the increasing human impacts within Macquarie Harbour.<br/><br/>The two subpopulations (Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour) are separated by ocean and, to date, no individuals have been captured in the marine environment. Due to the physical segregation of these populations, the two subpopulations may be genetically distinct.",Decreasing,"The Maugean Skate is a&#160;temperate Australian species, confined to two large estuary systems in western Tasmania, Bathurst and Macquarie Harbours. The Maugean Skate appears to be mainly in the upper estuary to freshwater sectors of Macquarie Harbour, however, recent studies have shown that they do move quite extensively throughout the harbour (J. Lyle, pers. comm., 01/04/2015). The total available habitat is no more than 200-300 km², therefore, the species' area of occupancy (AOO) is &lt;300 km<sup></sup>².",This species is protected under Australian law and is not utilized or traded.,Marine,"The species is listed as Endangered on the Commonwealth <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</em> and the <em>Tasmania Threatened Species Protection Act</em>, and is therefore protected by Australian and Tasmanian law. Bathurst Harbour is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which provides some protection for Maugean Skate habitat, however, dedicated scientific surveys have failed to find the species there in the past 20 years.&#160;There are ongoing research projects being conducted by the University of Tasmania's Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) in Macquarie Harbour aiming to better identify the preferred habitat and distribution of this skate within the estuary (J.

It has only been known to occur to a depth of 20 m in three inland cave or sink hole systems in the northern Bahamas: the Lucayan Caverns, the Zodiac Caverns, and one or two inland sink holes on Abaco Island. Its estimated area of occupancy (AOO) is less than 100 km² and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 2,705 km², which meets the thresholds for Endangered under criteria B1 and B2.<br/><br/>The taxonomy of the <em>Lucifuga</em> genus is not yet complete, but is currently being researched. Although data are limited, the population size of <em>L. lucayana</em> is potentially very small. The characteristic low levels of oxygen within these caves is another significant limiting factor. Data on the life history of <em>L. lucayana</em> are limited, and few mature females have been found. It has been inferred that <em>Lucifuga</em> species have a long generation length.<br/><br/>Threats to cave-dwelling species in the Caribbean include habitat degradation through rock removal or siltation, hydrological manipulations caused by water removal, environmental pollution, and the introduction of alien species. Typically, a cave that is near high densities of human populations is more threatened. Currently, Lucayan Caverns is protected within the Lucayan National Park, which is managed by the Bahamas National Trust and restricts recreational scuba diving to special permission only.

It has been collected to a maximum size of 12.5 cm standard length (SL).<br/><br/>The environmental conditions of the sink holes are unknown, but both of the caves are anchialine in nature, where the top layer of water is fresh and the bottom is salty due to a subterranean connection to the sea. This species has been collected and observed from the fresh layer at Lucayan Caverns and from the salty layer at Zodiac Caverns, indicating that it is euryhaline in nature (Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006). Caribbean anchialine caves have very low levels of oxygen in the water and sediments, often with a boundary layer of hydrogen sulphide separating the fresh and salty (Hutchinson 1999, Bishop <em>et al</em>. 2004). The biogeochemistry of individual holes/caves vary widely, with particular sensitivity to solar insolation, water flow velocities, and organic matter inputs (Hutchinson 1999, Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. 2011). Due to the already harsh nature of this environment, even slight changes in cave water quality can negatively affect troglobitic organisms, which have already adapted with very low metabolic rates and small size so as to efficiently use energy when oxygen and food supply are scarce (Hutchinson 1999, Bishop <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Food availability is a significant limiting factor for these cave fishes. Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that food webs in these caves may be dependent on indigenous bacterial primary production. Populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. seem to remain stable throughout the year, but the populations of the invertebrates that constitute their diet fluctuate significantly (Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012). The highest densities of <em>Lucifug</em>a spp. are usually observed hiding under ledges and in dark alcoves near the entrance where prey items tend to congregate (Trajano 2001). <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. are opportunistic, passive foragers that primarily prey on troglobitic amphipods and mysids, but will also eat crustaceans and shrimp (Trajano 2001, Moller et al. 2006, Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999). Vegetable matter was found in the digestive tract of the holotype of <em>L. simile</em>. Populations of <em>Lucifuga </em>spp. are significantly more abundant in caves that bats also inhabit because their guano fertilizes the water and promotes growth of food sources for the fish (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999).<br/><br/>Data on the reproductive strategy of <em>L. lucayana</em> are limited, however, two other species of <em>Lucifuga</em> that are endemic to freshwater caves in Cuba have a breeding peak in March, with females carrying 2-15 embryos that are approximately 2.5 cm SL at birth (Eigenmann 1909). The ovaries in female fishes of the <em>Lucifuga</em> and <em>Ogilbia</em> genera are very similar, however, sexual structures of the male, though both intromittent, are different&#160;(Møller<em> et al.</em> 2016). Male fishes are characterized by the presence of an external reproductive organ anterior to the anal fin, which it uses to facilitate internal fertilization of females (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 1999). It is thought that mating begins as soon as the female reaches maturity, when the female is able to carry and even nourish the delivered spermatozoa within their body for long periods of time. Throughout their five stages of development, the embryos of <em>Ogilbia</em> spp. obtain nutrients from yolk and ovigerous tissue produced within the female. Fecundity levels among bythitids vary greatly (Wourms 1981). The significantly smaller brood size of <em>L. lucayana</em> compared to other bythitid species, is probably due to a longer gestation of the embryos, which allow them to reach a more advanced stage of development, and consequently, allow for a greater chance of survival after birth (Suarez 1975). Reproduction may be infrequent and fecundity relatively low, but further research is needed (Trajano 2001, Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012). Definitive data on the longevity of <em>L. lucayana</em> are unknown, but it may be inferred that <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. have a long generation length because their populations are small and there have been very few captures of juveniles or pregnant females (Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012).","<em>Lucifuga lucayana</em> may be experiencing direct threats from habitat degradation and introduced alien species. Proudlove (2001) described five main threats to cave-dwelling species: habitat degradation through rock removal or siltation, hydrological manipulations caused by water removal, environmental pollution, overexploitation, and the introduction of alien species. On multiple occasions, people have reported evidence of trash, sewage, industrial pollution, and competition from introduced species in caves throughout the range of all Caribbean <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. (Hutchinson 1999, Proudlove 2001, Proudlove 2006, Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006, Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011). The level of impact and rate of occurrence of these disturbances directly correlates to the location of the cave/hole in relation to human population density. A hole/cave that is distantly located and difficult to access will remain more pristine and unaltered (Proudlove 2001). In contrast, increasing human population density around a subterranean habitat is a threat. There is concern that caves that are proximal to dense human populations could be exposed to insecticide spraying (Hutchinson 1999).&#160;Caves used intensively for swimming might be affected by sun screens and eutrophication.&#160;<br/><br/>Scuba divers can be detrimental to these caves when they disturb the stratification of bacterial mats that lie near the halocline, enrich the levels of oxygen in the water, and perhaps introduce flora and fauna to the system. Some opinions, however, are that any information gained from further exploration of these environments may overcome the possible negative effects especially because a small proportion of these holes are likely to be affected by such activity (Hutchinson 1999, Proudlove 2001).","Cave-diving expeditions can be logistically challenging and dangerous to undertake, therefore population data for <em>L. lucayana</em> are limited. The <em>Lucifuga</em> genus continues to evolve due to the discovery of new species in previously unexplored caves throughout the Caribbean. It will be difficult to grasp a complete understanding of the populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. until a more detailed picture of their diversity and distribution is realized (Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006, Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011). Garcia-Machado and Hernandez (2012) reported that populations of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. tend to remain stable throughout the year.<br/><br/>This species was originally described from six specimens collected between the years 1980 and 1984 from two caves and one or two sink holes in the northern Bahamas. Due to very few specimens having been identified, the population size of <em>L. lucayana</em> may be small. Møller <em>et al</em>. (2006) calculated the population size of <em>L. spelaeotes</em>, a closely related species with a wider distribution but also endemic to the Bahamas, as less than 1,000 individuals. Since the description in 2006, to our knowledge no additional specimens have been collected. A seventh specimen collected September 8 also in Lucayan Cavern was donated by Jill Yager to the Natural History Museum of Denmark.",Unknown,"In general, <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. have highly patchy distributions, where they are only found in inland karst caves located near coastal margins (Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Lucifuga lucayana</em> has been found in at least three inland cave or sink hole systems in the northern Bahamas to a depth of 20 m: the Lucayan Caverns in central southern Grand Bahama Island, the Zodiac Caverns on Sweetings Cay in eastern Grand Bahama, and one or two inland sink holes on Abaco Island (Little Bahama Bank). The range of this species is separated from that of <em>L. spelaeotes</em> by the deep waters of the Providence Channels. When <em>L. spelaeotes</em> was listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List in 1996 (World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1996), its AOO was calculated as less than 100 km² with the number of recorded locations as less than five (Moller <em>et al</em>. 2006). This species is currently only known from three localities with an estimated EOO of 2,705 km² (based on a minimum convex polygon drawn around the extent of its range). Since not all caverns are mapped in the Bahamas, the AOO is currently unknown, however, it is inferred to be less than 100 km².","<p><em>Lucifuga lucayana</em> is not utilized.<br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><strong></strong></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<em>Lucifuga</em> species play an important ecological role in the balance of caves that they inhabit (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999). The threats of ongoing habitat degradation by human activities within the extremely limited distribution and the more recent widespread introduction of alien species that deplete the limited food supply of <em>Lucifuga</em> spp. require the attention of conservationists. Since species diversity for the <em>Lucifuga</em> genus is likely underestimated due to the incomplete exploration of their highly fragmented distribution, implementing conservation could be difficult without a more complete list of specific holes/caves that currently harbour populations (Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Some <em>Lucifuga</em> species have been successfully bred in captivity, which could prove beneficial if a population needs replenishment (Proudlove 2001). <em>Lucifuga simile</em> has been raised successfully on a diet of <em>Troglocubanus</em> spp. (cave shrimp) (Garcia-Debras and Gonzalez 1999). Further research on rearing <em>L. lucayana</em> should be explored.<br/><br/>The Lucayan Caves are contained within the Lucayan National Park, which is managed by the Bahamas National Trust, an organization tasked with the conservation of the country's natural resources. Diving in the Lucayan Caves is regulated to certain areas and is allowed only by special permission from the Underwater Explorers Society to experienced and trained divers. Details on diving in the Zodiac Caverns and holes on Abaco Island are not available at this time. The Bahamas Caves Research Foundation, drafted a proposal in the year 2010 that would protect 17 blue holes on Great Abaco Island and create awareness about cave conservation (Kakuk and Patterson 2010). Efforts to contact both the BNT and BCRF via email to request further information on conservation measures specific to these cave environments were largely unanswered. Proudlove (2001) reported that most <em>Lucifuga</em> species listed as threatened or more are not receiving necessary conservation attention. Habitat management, monitoring, education, and economic activities surrounding subterranean cave systems should be considered during the planning process (Garcia-Machado <em>et al</em>. 2011, Garcia-Machado and Hernandez 2012).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Historically both adults and juveniles have been heavily exploited throughout its range, and it is highly valued in markets for live trade. Much of the information on past and present abundance of Hong Kong grouper is anecdotal or incomplete, but several accounts support evidence for severe declines in many parts of its range, especially mainland China, the main area where this species occurs after Japan and South Korea. Populations in Korea, Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had collapsed by the mid-1990s due to overexploitation. Since this initial severe decline, populations have remained at very low levels. Few fishing areas still have this fish and these are mainly offshore islands with severe reductions (&gt;90%) in all inshore areas of China, including Hong Kong, where the species was abundant before the 1980s. Trade also declined substantially. In China, declines in sizes caught and extension of fishing grounds to maintain catches also support evidence for severe overfishing. Reported catches are now negligible almost everywhere, except in one area of western Japan. There is still use of wild broodstock and juveniles for growout culture and low success of hatchery production. There is also a possibility for loss of significant levels of natural genetic diversity and for reduction of first sexual maturation in age and size given severely reduced populations. No effective conservation measures are known.<br/><br/>The apparent dire state of stocks and continued high fishing pressure on this fish and damage to its habitat throughout almost all of its geographic range mean it maybe heading towards extinction in the wild in some areas. This information is worrying enough to support the precautionary approach adopted here. It is suspected that the global population declined by approximately 50 to 80% over the past three generations (i.e., 33 years; 1983-2016), with increases only noted in one area in western Japan over the last decade and extremely low levels indicated throughout the rest of its geographic range. It is therefore listed as Endangered A2d. The following research is greatly needed: genetic structure of populations, fishery catch and effort data and underwater census surveys. Conservation measures are needed to reduce fishing effort and monitor populations.<em><em><br/></em></em>","This species inhabits coral and rocky reefs to at least 55 m depth, and juveniles tend to occur in shallower depths than adults (Sadovy and Cornish 2000, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011). Its maximum standard length is 35 cm (Masuda <em>et al</em>. 1984). Tseng and Ho (1988) reported that fishers from Hong Kong operating in the East and South China Seas take adult and spawning fish along the continental shelf at depths of 27 to 55 metres. In Byonsan Peninsula of Korea, spawning occurs from late July to early August. Hermaphrodites measured about 28 to 32 cm, and males were 40 cm (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1998). An age and growth study found that individuals with total lengths ranging from 12 to 24 cm were about one year of age, 16 to 28 cm at two years, 20 to 32 cm at three years, 22 to 36 cm at four years, 32 to 42 cm at five years, 36 to 48 cm at six years or older; within the same age group, there could be a variability in length of 10 to 14 cm (Kayano 2012). Its longevity is 19 years and sexual maturation occurs at three years and about 23-24 cm standard length (Tseng and Ho 1988). There is no published literature that identifies this species as an aggregate spawner. One report from a recreational diver in Hong Kong observed up to 50 individuals close together on the reef on several different occasions in the summer season (P. Chan pers. comm. 2001). Most fishery catches occur or occurred during the short reproductive season, but there is no clear evidence of spawning aggregation. Further studies on the reproductive biology of this species in captivity, including sexual maturation, sexual lability and sex change were reported by Ukawa <em>et al</em>. (1966), Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1988), Lee and Hur (1997, 1998), Okumura <em>et al</em>. (2002), Li <em>et al</em>. (2006), He <em>et al</em>. (2011), Lee <em>et al</em>. (2014), Kim <em>et al</em>. (2015), and Liu <em>et al</em>. (2016).<br/><br/>Based on a longevity of 19 years, age of first maturity of three years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 11 years.","Overexploitation is a major threat to this species throughout its range. There is also a possibility for loss of significant levels of natural genetic diversity and for reduction of first sexual maturation in age and size given severely reduced populations in most of its range.&#160;Nearshore habitat degradation, which is extensive in the region, may also be a threat to this species.","<p>This species once supported significant fisheries through much of its range, but is now uncommon to rare in almost all areas according to data from both fishery landings and underwater visual surveys. Most of the current landings of this species are comprised of juveniles, which indicates that growth overfishing is likely occurring. Interviews and consultation with 31&#160;grouper fishers, 42&#160;farmers, 30&#160;fish hatchers, 21&#160;traders and fisheries departments were conducted in mainland China (Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan Provinces) between 2007 and 2008 (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). Interviews were also conducted elsewhere in&#160;<em>E. akaara</em>'s range, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. Results showed that,&#160;<em>E. akaara</em>&#160;was historically common in these areas, but has seriously declined since due to unsustainable fishing effort, including on juveniles. Supporting evidence included a reported decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) and a shift to offshore fishing grounds as adults declined beyond the level that could support a viable nearshore fishery (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). Maximum annual catches once peaked at several hundreds of tonnes in regions of China, but reported catches are now negligible almost everywhere, except in one area of western Japan (2013 – 43 tonnes). Mariculturists have successfully bred and raised the species in mainland China and Japan (Tseng and Ho 1988; reviewed in Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009), but the species is still predominantly taken from the wild for trade due to slow growth and poor production in captivity and restocking conducted in Japan and mainland China either long-term or occasionally is rarely demonstrated to be successful to date. Quantitative population data are very limited to non-existent for this species.

Catch subsequently declined by about 85-95% to one to three tonnes in the 1990s due to overfishing and changes in the fishing grounds (Kayano 2012). To supplement the population, the release of hatchery-produced young into Japanese coastal waters has increased in recent years (about 43 tons in 2013). Catch data for&#160;<em>E. akaara</em> are generally scarce in Japan; however, there is a recent dataset from Toyama Prefecture (website: ""Toyama Prefecture Fisheries Information System."" http://www.fish.pref.toyama.jp/) that indicates population increases are almost certainly the result of restocking in this area (Kayano 2012). Kayano&#160;(2012) found that most fish were caught at three years and then two years of age, with mode at size of capture being 20–22 cm, which is too young for the species, given its age of sexual maturation.</p><p><strong>Korea:</strong>&#160;There are no fishery catch or effort data on this species available from the South Korean government. Lee <em>et al.</em> (1998) described the stock of this species as sharply declining year by year in the 1990s due to overfishing. From 1992 to 1994, annual landings declined from about 2.25 to about 1.3 tonnes and fishing yields in coastal Byonsan Peninsula of Korea declined by more than 10% during the same time period (Lee <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;</p><p> <strong>Taiwan:</strong>&#160;No fishery catch or effort data are available in Taiwan, but it once supported a viable commercial fishery. Anecdotal reports indicate it is now considered rare in the area presumably due to overfishing&#160;(K-T. Shao&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2016).</p>  <p><strong>Hong Kong:</strong>&#160;In the 1960s and 1970s, local hand line fishers once frequently targeted this previously common species in islands off the mainland to the north of Hong Kong and in eastern waters, and was commonly sold live in Hong Kong city markets (Chan 1968, P. Chan pers. comm. 2014). By the late 1970s, fishermen began to supplement this high demand by capturing wild juveniles in large amounts and raising them in captivity for growout in floating cages, which contributed to growth overfishing (P. Chan pers. comm. 2014). Hong Kong grouper landings could not keep up with demand by the late 1970s and that prices had risen from HK$ 33-50/kg in 1978 to HK$ 50-70/kg in 1979 as a result (Tseng and Ho 1988). Juveniles are no longer readily available from Hong Kong (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). The population significantly declined in the&#160;1980s, and the species was no longer common by the 1990s (P. Chan pers. comm. 2001, Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). It is now rare or absent from commercial catches of today (Chan 1968, Sadovy and Cornish 2000). According to fisher interviews and anecdotal data, the substantial declines in landings&#160;are assumed to reflect declines in Hong Kong/regional grouper stocks since fishing effort has remained constant (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). FAO annual fishery landings statistics for <em>E. akaara</em> are very low to non-existent in recent years.&#160;According to the Hong Kong government’s Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department, there were few records of catch of this species prior to 2010 in their field studies (for example, less than five individuals were found between 2001 to 2004 in eastern waters; J. Lee pers. comm. 2016). Divers also reported that this species was relatively abundant in the 1960s and moderately common in the 1990s, but is now rarely observed in Hong Kong waters (Sadovy and Cornish 2000, To&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). During more than 700 underwater visual surveys conducted between 1996 to 1999, less than 10 individuals of this species were observed (To&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, A. Cornish and S. Shea pers. comm. 2016).&#160;</p><p><strong>Mainland China:&#160;</strong>This was once an abundant species in the early 1980s, but became very rare by the mid-1990s. In 1979, Hong Kong culturists purchased at least 180,000 kg (200,000-450,000 fish of 100-200 g) of this species for grow-out that had been wild-caught in southern China. Supply of early-stage juveniles was abundant in Fujian Province of mainland China in the early 1980s, but became very rare by 1994 and remains rare to the current day (Sadovy 2000, Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).&#160;</p>  <p><strong></strong></p>",Decreasing,"This western Pacific species occurs in southern Japan, Republic of Korea and southern China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan (Heemstra and Randall 1993). According to Seno (2013), its range in Japan&#160;is the Tsugaru Strait (between Honshu and Hokkaido islands) southward to the East China Sea coasts and Pacific coasts from southern Kyushu east to Sagami Bay. Reports from the Ogasawara Islands of Japan are questionable (Randall&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1997).&#160;In Japan, the range of this species may be extending northward, likely due to warming waters in the region. The species is also reported from the Gulf of Tonkin (Tseng and Ho 1988), making it likely that it also occurs in Viet Nam.","<p>Historically this species has been heavily exploited by recreational and commercial fisheries throughout its range. Trade mainly occurred between mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and sometimes with Japan but, due to population declines, it is relatively uncommon to rarely available for sale in the current day. Juveniles were also frequently exploited and grown in captivity prior to population exhaustion by the mid-1990s. It is a highly-valued species in the market, and is particularly favoured in the live seafood trade. The wild-capture fishery for this species in mainland China primarily supplies the live food fish trade in the Hong Kong market, and secondarily in domestic markets. A market survey of groupers sold in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006 reported that wild-caught individuals of this species ranked 12<sup>th</sup> out of 18 local grouper species, and that 86 individuals (37% of which were juveniles) were recorded in the market during this time (&lt;1% of total groupers; n=10,640 groupers) (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). Despite considerable effort, larval survival in captivity is low and highly variable due to this species' slow growth rates, sex ratios (sperm supply) and feeding of larvae (Okumura<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2002, Li&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, He&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). There is&#160;growing interest in obtaining broodstock for spawning and hatchery rearing&#160;(P. Chan pers. comm. 2002).&#160;Japan has had some success in restocking the species with hatchery produced animals (K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016).&#160;</p>",Marine,"Despite its known historical population decline due to overexploitation, this species is not managed effectively anywhere in its range. There is a very small no-take marine reserve at Cape d'Aguilar in Hong Kong where this species may be increasing in number (A. Cornish pers. obs. 2016), but no information is available on its status in protected areas located elsewhere in Hong Kong, southern Japan, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and mainland China. There is a need for time-series data, including annual landings, catch per unit effort and underwater visual surveys in all parts of its range. Such data would greatly increase the accuracy of future assessments. Furthermore, formal stock assessments of this species would increase the general knowledge of its population size and rates of decline. Genetics studies are needed to determine boundaries between subpopulations/stocks, if present. Studies are also needed on its reproductive behaviour in the wild, particularly whether the species aggregates to spawn.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Japan:&#160;</strong>Hatchery production started in the 1960s in Japan, but logistical problems hindered development, and a viral disease in the 1990s greatly reduced seed production. Broodstock for hatcheries are usually wild-caught near Seto Island in the Japan Inland Sea. Hatchery-produced young are released in efforts to rebuild the wild stock, mainly along the coasts of the Japan Sea (e.g., Yamaguchi, Tottori and Toyama) and the Seto Inland Sea (Okayama, Seto) (Liu and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009, K. Hoshino pers. comm 2016).<strong></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>China:</strong>&#160;Fishery regulations designed to reduce overall fishing effort were implemented in mainland Chinese waters (Yellow Sea and East China Sea) in 1995 and in 1999 in the South China Sea. These regulations include varying bans on fishing gear type as well as closed periods. In the South China Sea and Gulf of Tonkin, all fishing gear types are banned except single-layer gill nets, hook and line and trap fishing from May 16 to August 1. In the East China Sea, there is a closed period for light fishing from May 1 to July 1, for sail stake net fishing from May 1 to September 16, for shrimp trawling, trap and gill net fishing from June 1 to August 1 and for trawl fishing from June 1 to September 16. In the Yellow Sea, there is a closed period for trawl and sailing stake net fishing from June 1 to September 16. It is not known if these regulations reduce effort on populations of <em>Epinephelus akaara</em> specifically, but the&#160;primary gear used to capture this species are hook and line, traps and gill nets, which are gear types that only recently began to be managed in the East China Sea. Information is limited on the level of enforcement, but this&#160;is generally poor in China, so it is unlikely to be effective.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/>Hong Kong:</strong>&#160;There are no fishing restrictions specifically for this species in Hong Kong. Beginning in 2013, take of this species by bottom trawl may have been reduced in Hong Kong waters; however, overall fishing in the Hong Kong area has increased over recent decades and fishing by hook and line and other gears (trap and spear) has not declined. Moreover, illegal bottom trawling has continued in Hong Kong, and a recent trawling ban is not expected to significantly allow recovery of this species. A ban on electrofishing may have reduced catch of juveniles, but other methods during which juveniles of this species are captured are still permitted. This species was categorized as 'endangered' in 2015 during a Hong Kong Regional Red List assessment workshop that was sponsored by the government’s Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan under the Convention on Biological Diversity (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2015).","",,false,false,Global

It is heavily exploited by fisheries, including direct pressure on spawning aggregations. Since about the 1940s, catch, aggregation size and individual body size have declined by 50 to 90% and fishing pressure is expected to continue. It is inferred that its global population has declined by at least 50% and possibly more over the past three generation lengths (about 80 years); therefore, it is listed as Endangered A2bd. There is an urgent conservation need to reduce fishing effort on this species, particularly at spawning aggregation sites when adults are most vulnerable to fishing. There is also a need for basic biological information and increased monitoring of juvenile and adult populations.<br/></p>","This species inhabits rocky reefs, seamounts and kelp beds (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Craig <em>et al</em>. 2011). Adults mainly occur at depths between five to 30 metres, but may inhabit depths to 45 metres in summer months, and it has been observed on deep reefs to 100 metres (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Sala <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2010). Juveniles have been observed at shallow rocky reefs and artificial reefs as well as in estuaries, mangroves, and bays on the islands and coastlines throughout the northern and central Gulf of California (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008, Turk-Boyer <em>et al</em>. 2015). The maximum recorded total length is 198 cm and weight is 91 kg (Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983), although it is presumed that it may obtain larger sizes. Adults feed on large fishes, lobsters and slipper lobsters (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Its estimated age at first sexual maturity is six to seven years and 98 cm total length (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). Adults form spawning aggregations of 40 or more individuals from April to June in areas larger than 1,000 m² in the southern Gulf of California (T. Rowell, B. Erisman, O. Aburto-Oropeza unpub. data). Aggregations have been observed over rocky reefs or on seamounts with sharp drop-offs and an abundance of gorgonians and black coral (Sala <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008), but also over sand adjacent to reefs (e.g., Cabo Pulmo National Park). Spawning occurs in pairs, and individual males will spawn with multiple females during a single spawning period with an operational sex ratio of about three to five females per male (T. Rowell, B. Erisman, O. Aburto-Oropeza unpub. data). Since observed males appear to be much larger than females, sex ratios are biased towards females, spawning occurs in pairs, large males invest considerable energy in aggressive behaviour with males in adjacent territories, and there is no evidence of sperm competition, it is likely that this species is a protogynous hermaphrodite (B. Erisman pers. comm. 2016). However, this still requires confirmation by microscopic analyses of histological preparations. Longevity is estimated to be 48.3 years (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008), but no empirical studies on growth or longevity have been published. Based on a longevity of 48 years, age of first maturity of six years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 27 years.","This species is experiencing a major threat from heavy fishing pressure by recreational and small-scale commercial fisheries through most of its range (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Sáenz-Arroyo <em>et al</em>. 2005, Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008, Erisman <em>et al</em>. 2010). Secondary threats include the following: (1) bycatch in the commercial shrimp industry, (2) bycatch in the illegal totoaba fishery, (3) habitat degradation, (4) shrimp aquaculture, and (5) climate change (Dennis 2015). This species may be particularly susceptible to increasing water temperatures due to climate change since the centre of its abundance occurs within a Gulf that has a northern land boundary (i.e., it may not be able to expand to cooler waters) and indirect impacts from the potential loss of forage due to distribution shifts in their prey (Dennis 2015). The life history characteristics (form spatio-temporally predictable spawning aggregations; slow growth; late age at maturity; long lifespan) and restricted geographic range of this species are associated with high intrinsic vulnerability to fishing pressure (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 1998).","This species is naturally rare where it ranges north of Bahía Magdalena on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico into southern California, USA. Juveniles are unknown in California waters and few large adults have been taken there, probably as expatriates from a more southerly breeding population (Rosenblatt and Zahuranec 1967). It was once common along the southern Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula and in the Gulf of California in Mexico, but has severely declined throughout its range, and is now rarely observed. It was abundant in central Baja California in the Gulf of California in the past and probably dominated the rocky-reef fish community in terms of biomass; however, its population declined dramatically in the 1970s and is now scarce and in danger of localized extirpation. From the 1940s to present, the numbers of individuals within spawning aggregations has declined by at least 99% (Sáenz-Arroyo <em>et al</em>. 2005). Therefore, according to fisheries data, this species is inferred to have declined by at least 50% and possibly more over the past three generation lengths (1935-2016) and the threat from fishing is expected to continue in to the future.<br/><br/><strong>Fishery independent: </strong>Underwater surveys of rocky reef fishes have been conducted during the summer at sites throughout the Gulf of California continuously since 1998 by the Gulf of California Marine Program (GCMP; <a href=""http://gulfprogram.ucsd.edu/"">http://gulfprogram.ucsd.edu/</a>) and Comunidad y Biodiversidad (COBI). From 1998 to 2010 (12 year period), over 2,500 transects were conducted and this species was observed only 50 times, which accounted for less than 0.005% of all fishes counted, making it one of the rarest species recorded. Forty-percent of those 50 observations were made during surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010, which were also the years when 32% of all transects across the entire time period were conducted. Nearly all observations of adult individuals (&gt;100 cm total length) in the 2009 and 2010 surveys occurred during transects within the Cabo Pulmo National Park. According to recreational citizen science diver surveys in the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) database, the overall sighting frequency of this species in the Gulf of California is 2.1 (<a href=""http://www.reef.org/db/reports/dist/species/TEP/0055/1993-01-01/2016-09-13"">http://www.reef.org/db/reports/dist/species/TEP/0055/1993-01-01/2016-09-13</a>, accessed 13 September 2016).<br/><strong>Fishery dependent: </strong>Due to its naturally rarity in U.S. waters, fisheries data are not collected there. Fisher interviews indicate a 50 to 70% decline since 1950 in the Gulf of California (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ainsworth 2011). On a good fishing day in the 1940s, it was common to capture 25 or more individuals of this species, each more than 80 cm in length, but by 2000, the capture of even one or two individuals of less than 60 cm in length was considered a good fishing day. Fishers in the northern Gulf of California reported that abundance and relative biomass were high in the 1950s, but much lower in the 2000s (Ainsworth 2011). Interviews of 108 randomly selected fishers in fishing communities of central Baja California that were conducted in 2002 found that older (~ 55 years old) fishers caught up to 25 times as much <em>Mycteroperca jordani</em> as younger (15 to 30 years old) fishers on their best-ever fishing day and that the average size of individuals captured declined significantly over the fisher generations (Sáenz-Arroyo <em>et al</em>. 2005b). In 1959 and 1960, this species comprised 45% of the total state finfish landings in Baja California Sur, and by early 1972 it had declined to 6% (Sáenz-Arroyo <em>et al</em>. 2005a). By the 1990s, it was estimated to comprise less than 1% of the total finfish catch (Rámirez-Rodriguez 1996). In general, fish stocks in most areas of the Gulf of California had collapsed by the 1980s (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). The reported mean annual commercial landings of this species in the southwest Gulf of California from 1999 to 2007 was 9.7 tons, which represented 0.54% of the total reef fish species (Erisman <em>et al</em>. 2010). A fishery survey conducted in Bahía de Los Angeles in the northern Gulf of California in 2004, reported that immature individuals comprised approximately 99% of the commercial catch (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). In northwest Mexico, fisheries data were first identified to the level of species groups (i.e., several species of the same genus or family) in 2001 (Erisman <em>et al</em>. 2010). During a survey of the artisanal fishery of La Paz Bay, Baja California Sur, this species (incorrectly identified as <em>Epinephelus quinquefasciatus</em>) comprised 5.4% of the total catch from 1998 to 2005 (Vazquez-Hurtado <em>et al</em>. 2010). According to Mexican fisheries statistics for “garropa”- a category that includes <em>Mycteroperca jordani</em>, <em>M. xenarcha</em>, <em>Epinephelus quinquefasciatus</em> and <em>Stereolepis gigas</em> - catch increased by 153% from 78 metric tons in 2006 to 197 metric tons in 2014 and the majority of landings occurred in Baja California Sur (CONAPESCA, <a href=""http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad"">http://www.conapesca.gob.mx/wb/cona/informacion_estadistica_por_especie_y_entidad</a>, accessed 13/09/2016). Over the last 20 years (1990s to 2000s), landings have declined by 90% through much of the Gulf from an average of 50 tons per year to less than five tons per year (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). As of 2005-2010, this species comprised less than 1% of the total annual catch in the small-scale, commercial reef fish fishery of the Southern Gulf of California (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008, Erisman <em>et al</em>. 2010). An estimated 29% of the remaining population of this species are caught in the Gulf each year (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Decreasing,"<p>This species is distributed in the eastern tropical Pacific from San Carlos, Mexico, south to Mazatlán, Mexico, through the Gulf of California and the Revillagigedos Islands (Erisman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Robertson and Allen 2015). Records of this species from San Diego, California, USA from the 1940s and 1950s (Craig <em>et al</em>. 2006) are likely based on waifs. Its depth range is 5-100 metres.&#160;</p>","<p>Despite low landings volumes, this relatively large species is still considered one of the most valuable species of grouper in commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of California (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). In a 2003 survey of recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf of California, it was reported to be the 8th most important (as measured by % capture) fish species caught (Turk-Boyer <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the northern Gulf, it is commercially harvested by diving, gillnets (as bycatch), longline and hand line (Moreno-Baáez <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2012). It has been a primary target of recreational spearfishers since at least the 1950s (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is also taken by hook and line, especially at spawning aggregation sites in late Spring. This species is also taken as bycatch in the Gulf of California shrimp trawl fishery.<br/></p>",Marine,"There are no species-specific national regulations in place for <em>Mycteroperca jordani</em> in Mexico (Dennis 2015). Fishing is allowed in many zones within protected areas, and enforcement of no-take zones is very poor in most areas (Rife <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, there is evidence for effective protection of this species in Cabo Pulmo National Park (Aburto-Oropeza <em>et al</em>. 2011, B. Erisman pers. comm. 2016). A fishermen-led, voluntary marine reserve off Isla Magdalena, Baja California Sur established in 2009 also has a higher biomass of this species inside the reserve as compared to unprotected sites (Villaseñor-Derbez <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>This species was listed as 'endangered' under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2016, which bans anybody subject to U.S. jurisdiction to harvest this species in U.S. waters or on the high seas (http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/fish/gulf-grouper.html, accessed 15 September 2016). However, given that this species is historically rare in U.S. waters, such a measure is unlikely to have a measurable impact on the preservation of the species.<br/><br/>Given the widespread declines of landings and regional populations of this species throughout its range due to fishing, there is an urgent conservation need to reduce fishing effort on this species, particularly at spawning aggregation sites when adults are most vulnerable to fishing. In addition, there is a need for basic biological information on this species (recruitment, growth and longevity, sexual maturity, etc.) and increased monitoring of juvenile and adult populations. Such information is crucial for managers to assess and monitor populations and set fishery regulations that ensure population recovery.","",,false,false,Global

It is likely demersal on the insular shelves and its depth is unknown, but like other guitarfishes, is presumably less than 100 m. The species is mainly taken as retained bycatch of industrial and artisanal demersal trawls and gillnets and the meat is consumed locally, and fins of larger individuals are possibly traded. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well landings declines of rays of 60–88% consistent with population reductions of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. It is suspected that the Borneo Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Borneo Guitarfish is presumably demersal on the continental shelf and its depth is unknown, but like other guitarfishes, is presumably less than 100 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).

The Common Guitarfish has an age-at-maturity of four years and a maximum age of 24 years and, thus, a generation length of 14 years (Başusta <em>et al</em>. 2008).

Guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat, and only the fins of the largest individuals are generally retained (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Borneo Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016). In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade (Chen 1996, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including guitarfishes, may be targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all giant guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The Borneo Guitarfish is likely retained and landed throughout its range and Malaysia a ranks among the top ten shark fishing nations globally (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of IUU in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey et al. 2010). The shallow, inshore soft-bottom habitat preferred by the species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In Southeast Asia, there has been an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There are no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Whiprays live in similar habitat and would have similar catchability to guitarfishes. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are two lines of evidence&#160; that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo.<br/><br/>In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t by 2015, despite the constant effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 60% over three generation lengths (27 years) of the Borneo Guitarfish.<br/><br/>In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase in whipray catches from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A decline of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, peaking at 7,700 t in 1997 before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004; a 52% decline (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays (and presumably guitarfishes) are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 88% over the three generation lengths (27 years) of the Borneo Guitarfish.<br/><br/>This species is only found in a small area that is easily accessible and adjacent to heavily populated areas. Actual levels of exploitation are extremely high across the range of this species; therefore, it is suspected that the Borneo Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (27 years) due to actual levels of fishing pressure, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.",Decreasing,The Borneo Guitarfish occurs in the Western Central Pacific in the South China Sea off the north coast of Borneo (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).,"Guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for their meat which is of good quality and is consumed fresh locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g. Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Guitarfish fins are utilised, however, due to their smaller size their value is lower than the value of fins from Giant Guitarfishes or Wedgefishes and fins from smaller individuals are generally discarded.

It is demersal on the inner continental shelf from the surface down to a depth of 50 m. It is captured in shrimp trawl and gillnets and rays tend to be targeted by industrial and artisanal fleets. Species-specific data remain limited due to species misidentifications and recent taxonomic changes. Declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing has been reported for India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. This species has not been recorded recently on the west coast of India in regular trawl surveys and this historically widely distributed species now has a much narrower distribution. Even on the east coast (Tamil Nadu to West Bengal) of India, few individuals have been encountered and this number has declined during 2010–2018 surveys and the Indian Sharpnose Ray is now only regularly observed in the east coast from Odisha to West Bengal. The entire geographic range of the species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure with little refuge at depth. The steep decline in landings of batoids in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan is consistent with a population reduction of 54–84% over three generation lengths (26 years). Hence, it is suspected that the Indian Sharpnose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Indian Sharpnose Ray is demersal on continental and insular shelves down to depths of 50 m, but typically caught at 20–30 m depth (Last et al. 2016b, K.V. Akhilesh and K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 40 cm disc width (DW) or around 120 cm total length; males mature at 28 cm DW and females mature at 30 cm DW (Last et al. 2016b). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 1–4 pups and size-at-birth is 8 cm DW (Last et al. 2016b). As there is no information on this species' age-at-maturity and maximum age, generation length was inferred as 8.5 years based on data for the similarly sized Plain Maskray (<em>Neotrygon annotata</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","The Indian Sharpnose Ray is a small species that was regularly caught as bycatch in trawls and gillnets within its range. Rays tend to be subject to target fisheries in Pakistan, Indian and Bangladesh (K.K. Bineesh and M. Moazzam unpubl. data 2020). The limited geographic distribution of this species overlaps with intense coastal fisheries and the shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). Also, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (approximately three generation lengths). For example, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen et al. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010).","Trawl surveys in Mumbai, off the west coast of India have recorded this species (as <em>Dasyatis zugei</em>) as representing less than 1% of ray landings by weight (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Catches of this species steadily declined from 4.5 t between 1990–1992 to no reported catches in 2002–2004. However, recent changes in the taxonomy of ray species has led to uncertainties in previous data collected and specimens of the Indian Sharpnose Ray may have also been recorded as Bengal Whipray (<em>Brevitrygon</em> <em>imbricata</em>), the second most common ray encountered in Indian fisheries which has had steady landings over the period from 1993 to 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009, K.V. Akhilesh unpubl. data 16/05/2017). This indicates that it was an abundant species in trawl catches, but still declining considerably due to trawl effort doubling during this period. Indeed, this species has not been recorded in regular trawl surveys in West India since 2008. Bineesh <em>et al</em>. (2017) extensively surveyed the southwest coast of India as a part of DNA barcoding study and elasmobranch catch monitoring programme during 2009–2015. However, not a single individual of Indian Sharpnose Ray was recorded from the survey. The recent surveys conducted along the east coast (Tamil Nadu to West Bengal) found few individuals and the number of encounters declined during the 2010–2018 surveys with the current distribution now confined to a small stretch of east coast from Odisha to West Bengal where the species is regularly observed (K.V. Akhilesh and K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Intensive fishing by trawlers in shallow depths targeting shrimps and sole fishes catch large numbers of small-sized rays and lead to population reduction of rays (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure have been reported for India. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Although this information is not species-specific, and the actual proportion of the Indian Sharpnose Ray in the catch in unknown, it provides an indication of batoid declines in India. This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 84% over the three generation lengths (26 years) of the Indian Sharpnose Ray.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, this species is not very commonly landed, but it is observed throughout the year. Generally, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years, including of the smaller rays like the Indian Sharpnose Ray (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Landing site and elasmobranch processing site surveys revealed increasing numbers of smaller rays being caught and dried for mainly national consumption. Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a seven-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals, whereas recent seven-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Reconstructed landings data of sharks, skates, and rays in Bangaldesh showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 then declined to the 3,500 t in the mid-1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 54% over the three generation lengths (26 years) of the Indian Sharpnose Ray.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the use of bottom-set gillnets targeting rays has almost doubled in the last five years due to increasing demand for stingray wings in Thailand and Malaysia. Annual landings of rays was reported to be 42,000 t in 1979, 41,230 t in 1980, and 20,780 t in 1999 which reduced to 3,723 t in 2019; landings were mainly from targeted gillnet fisheries and bycatch of other fisheries, primarily trawls (M. Moazzam unpubl. data 2020). This level of decline equates to a population reduction of 79% over the three generation lengths (26 years).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The entire Indian range of the species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure, with little refuge. The landings of rays in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan infer population reductions of 54–84% over three generation lengths (26 years). Hence, it is suspected that the Indian Sharpnose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Indian Sharpnose Ray is found in the northern Indian Ocean in India (Last et al. 2016b).

Reproduction is likely viviparous and size-at-birth is 5–9 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016b). Little else is known of its biology. As there is no information on the age-at-maturity or maximum age of this species, generation length was inferred to be 8.5 years based on the Plain Maskray (Neotrgyon annotata), which attains a similar maximum size (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010).","The Javan Whipray is caught in tanglenets used to target prawns. This species is especially susceptible to heavy fishing pressure as its area of occupancy (AOO) is limited to 96 km² spread across two locations, which does not include any refuge areas. It lives in shallow, coastal areas and its distribution is adjacent to heavily populated areas, making it easily accessible to fishers (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally and the country has been among the top shark fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). The catch of rays is rising as shark fisheries collapse; in 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Dharmadi 2007).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters adjacent to mangrove habitat means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, agriculture and climate change. Across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of whiprays from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Indian Ocean portion of the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), specifically western Sumatra and southern Java, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in this region; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and arise from shifts in fishing effort into further and deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). With the increased catch through this part of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). This species is predominantly found in inshore and mangrove areas and is thus more susceptible to intense fishing pressure. <br/><br/>The Javan Whipray has a small geographic distribution and occurs inshore adjacent to nearby heavily populated areas. Thus, there is ease of access to the species' entire distribution and fishing pressure is extremely high. Considering the catch trends and the limited distribution near heavily populated areas, it is suspected that the Javan Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (26 years).",Decreasing,"The Javan Whipray is endemic to southern Java, Indonesia in the Eastern Indian Ocean (Last <em>et al. </em>2016b).",The flesh of the Javan Whipray is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).,Marine,"<p></p><p></p>No specific measures are in place.

It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan EEZ (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956–2004) but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956–2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Seine nets and bottom trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<p>In the Philippines, the Sharpnose Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but the government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).</span></p><p>The Sharpnose Whipray is among the most commonly landed rays (combined with <em>M. gerrardi</em>) in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White unpubl. data 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and trawl and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>The Sharpnose Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Taiwan, indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). There has been an estimated 10-20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">D</a>espite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Chinese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). As the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power are continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The reconstructed catch data showed a decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Chinese EEZ over 65 years, from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014, a 67% decline in less than three generation lengths.&#160;Additionally, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured in Chinese waters (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p><p>In Taiwan, landings data are available on the combined catch of all ray species taken by bottom trawl in Da-xi, Yilan County. The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993–2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics 2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993–2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019)<strong>.</strong></p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017) This indicates a decrease 0f 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006.</p><p>Landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZ. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian EEZ.</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (57 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>Two lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Central Indonesia and a research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Sharpnose Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (57 years).</p><p>In Viet Nam, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 are available based on landings data (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p><p>In Cambodia, this species is now considered rare but is caught in trawls, gillnets, and longlines (S. Li unpubl. data 2020). This may be indicative of historic depletions. There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Sharpnose Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Sharpnose Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (57 years).</p>",Decreasing,The Sharpnose Whipray occurs through the Indo-Pacific Ocean from Indonesia to Taiwan (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).,"<p>Sharpnose Whipray meat is considered among the best for rays and the species is commonly landed throughout Malaysia and Indonesia (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is the most common ray in the markets in Singapore, comprising up to 67% (combined with <em>M. gerrardi</em>) of rays in the market (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). They are frequently landed throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range and the meat is consumed fresh for human consumption with excess meat dried and salted (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In response to the fish stock depletion, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk21689683"">In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk21689697""></a>There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983, in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). These bans and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on ""muro ami"" gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Throughout Indonesia, there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>In Viet Nan, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance are limited (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are  prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is a euryhaline species that inhabits freshwater, estuarine, and inshore marine habitats. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, recreational and industrial fisheries by a wide range of fishing gears, and is retained for consumption and for display in public aquaria. The Giant Freshwater Whipray is uncommon throughout its range with a population decline of at least 60% over 26 years inferred in Cambodia, with the decline reported to be greater in upstream than downstream areas. Steep declines in catches of this species and other freshwater rays in Thailand are reported from the early 1990s. The species is subject to intensive historic and current fishing pressure and intensive habitat modification and degradation across its entire known range. It has little refuge from these threats and drastic declines in fish diversity and declines in freshwater fisheries due to over-exploitation have also occurred in its range. It is suspected that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (24–66 years) due to inferred declines, declines in habitat quality, and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Giant Freshwater Whipray is a euryhaline species found in freshwater, estuarine, and inshore marine habitats (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Grant <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). It reaches a maximum size of at least 223 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~110 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reproduction is viviparous, with histotrophy, with litter size of 1–2 pups, possibly up to 3 pups (Z. Hogan pers. obs. 2008), and size-at-birth of ~30 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019). Preliminary estimates of age-at-maturity is 3 years and maximum age is 12 years (Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019), which would result in a generation length of 7.5 years. However, these ages are not verified or validated (Phomikong <em>et al</em>. 2019), and seem low estimates for a large whipray. There is no age information for other <em>Urogymnus </em>species, although age data is available for other dasyatids, that is, the smaller Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (80 cm DW) and Brown Stingray (<em>Dasyatis lata</em>) (144 cm DW) that have generation lengths of 19.5 years and 21.5 years respectively, and for the Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) which is another large-bodied catadromous ray that has a generation length of 22 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011, Dale and Holland 2012, Kyne and Feutry 2013). Thus, a cautious estimate of generation length of 8–22 years is inferred for the Giant Freshwater Whipray.","<span style="""">  </span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p>The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in subsistence, small-scale, recreational and industrial fisheries and is retained for consumption and for display in public aquaria. The species is subject to intensive fisheries and habitat degradation in most of its range, as it occurs in areas where human population has expanded dramatically in recent decades. It occurs in rivers that have been dammed, which may prevent migration and isolate parts of the reproductive populations, potentially reducing the genetic diversity of the species (Compagno and Cook 2005).<br/><br/>In the Sundarbans region of India and Bangladesh, this species is caught by trawl fishers operating in river environments (e.g., Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Bangladesh, it is also caught as bycatch in set-bag nets and demersal gillnets, and is targeted with longlines (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). Severe habitat degradation is ongoing throughout the Sundarbans and associated rivers. This is driven by high human population density resulting in pollution (general, agricultural, chemical, sewage, and industrial), over-harvesting of fisheries resources, vegetation removal, and upstream river engineering (e.g., Barman 2007, Sen and Mandal 2019, Sievers et al. 2020), while climate change presents a mounting issue with respect to delta habitat loss (Majumder and Barman 2013).<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught by fishers in the Chao Phraya and Mea Khlong River Basins. Fisheries include small-scale, industrial, harvest for aquaria, and recreational sport fishing. This species is not known to survive well in aquaria, resulting in continual frequent harvest to maintain display animals (Compagno and Cook 2005). Sportfishing may be a serious threat as anglers have the equipment necessary to catch very large individuals and sport anglers do not always release their catch. Some catch and release anglers use very invasive techniques such as gaffing and hanging for display. Environmental degradation from pollution, damming, land clearing and altered sediment flow regimes are also likely adversely affecting populations of this species throughout Thailand (Compagno and Cook 2005, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Mekong River, this species is caught by local fishers (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Lower Mekong River supports the largest inland fishery globally and over 100 gear types are used which are categorised into hand capture, wounding gear, traps, gillnet, covering gear, luring devices, illegal methods (electro-fishing etc.), and anaesthetic methods (plant poisons) (Ainsworth et al. 2021). The Mekong River has been subject to significant damming (Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019) leading to severe habitat degradation around the Mekong Delta, as sediment flow has been significantly reduced. These effects in the Lower Basin are expected to be exacerbated by climate change and raising sea levels (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). Dams may now prevent migration of this species into many of the Mekong tributaries or upstream into northern Laos.<br/><br/>This species has only recently been widely recorded throughout Borneo, including Brunei Darussalam, suggesting that catch rates by local fishing gear is, or at least has historically been, infrequent (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Iqbal and Yustian 2016, Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sabah, fishers catch this species along with other rays on rod and reel or longline, and retain it for consumption or sale (Manjaji-Matsumoto 2002, Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Hydroelectric and reservoir dams, habitat degradation through land clearing, and pollution throughout Malaysian Borneo have been noted as a significant threat to this species (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Across the Kalimantan range of the species, a wide range of fishing gear is used that includes nets, gillnets, trawl, fish traps, hook and line (including longline), and gillnets, while poisons and electro-fishing techniques are used despite being prohibited (Christensen 1993, Thornton 2017, Purwanto 2018, Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019, Muthmainnah and Rais 2020, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). Across the West Kalimantan range of the species, habitat degradation from land clearing, agriculture, and mining pollution is present in the Kapuas River leading to increased sediment and heavy metals (Lusiana <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Central Kalimantan, very little is known of the local range of the Giant Freshwater Whipray within the Barito and Kahayan River Basins. Habitat threats include aquaculture, logging, dams and forest burning, which collectively increase sediment and nutrient loading in the river (Thornton 2017). In Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, numerous threats including logging, mining, agriculture (burning, land clearing, agrochemicals), forest fires, and pollution associated with villages and towns have resulted in habitat modification and degradation (Yule <em>et al</em>. 2010, de Jong <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ainsworth <em>et al</em>. 2021). High fishing intensity in North Kalimantan is driven by targeting of Mahseer fish (<em>Tor </em>spp.) and concern exists for poaching of fisheries resources, including in rivers in neighbouring Sarawak Sabah (Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deforestation is also an ongoing issue in North Kalimantan, leading to degradation of river environments (Amrullah <em>et al</em>. 2019, Anau <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In Java, the Citarum River has been heavily impacted by urban and industrial development, including a reservoir dam in the middle-lower part of the river (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Sumatra, Indonesia, recreational and small-scale fishers catch Giant Freshwater Whiprays, using hook and line, gillnets, casts nets, and various traps (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018a, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018b, V. Hasan unpubl. data 2021). Environmental threats are poorly defined, though damming, agriculture, mining, land clearing, and increased sedimentation are likely present throughout most river basins (e.g., Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laumonier <em>et al</em>. 2010, Grill <em>et al</em>. 2019). In the Musi River Basin, oil palm, rubber plantations, and densely populated regions where pressures exist from fisheries, habitat modification, and industrial pollution are a threat to this species (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2018a).<br/><span style=""""></span>","It is possible that there are subpopulations of this species as populations in Thailand and the Mekong differ genetically from those in India (Sezaki <em>et al</em>. 1999, Vidthayano <em>et al</em>. 2016), and the morphological form of the animal in Thailand is distinct from that in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra (G.P. J. Naylor pers. comm. 29 April 2021). This species is uncommon throughout its known range. In Bangladesh, fishers report large declines in abundance of large-bodied rays, likely including this species, due to overfishing and in particular, demersal trawling (A.B Haque unpubl. data 2021). Fishers reported that when fishing for large rays 10 years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals whereas recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large individuals (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Thailand, in the Mae Khlong and Bangpakong Rivers, anecdotal information from fishers suggested that in the early 1990s and 2000s, catches of this species declined from 2 to 3 individuals per day to one individual every 2–3 days (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In central Thailand, fishers reported a dramatic decline in catches of this species from 25 to 3 individuals in one year from 1992 to 1993; that is, a decline of 88% (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). Steep declines in freshwater rays in the Thai rivers in the early 1990s led the government to attempt to reduce species loss by implementing a captive breeding program of some freshwater ray species, including this species, and the White-edge Whipray (<em>Fluvitrygon signifer</em>), Marbled Whipray (<em>F. oxyrhynchus</em>), and introduction of the Mekong Stingray (<em>Hemitrygon laosensis</em>); this breeding program was later suspended (Compagno and Cook 2005). Some of these species were suspected to have subsequently declined due to intensive fisheries for freshwater teleosts and large-scale habitat degradation from dam building and pollution from agriculture and industrial development (Compagno 2005). Fish diversity in the Chao Phraya River drastically declined due to these threats (Compagno 2005). Declines in freshwater fisheries due to over-exploitation has also been noted in the Chao Phraya and Mae Khlong Rivers. It is highly likely that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone steep declines in these Thai rivers.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, fishers reported a 62% decline in catches of this species from 1980 to ~2006, with the average size and weight also declining (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the lower Cambodian Mekong, declines of 50–95% were reported, while in the upper Cambodia Mekong, declines were also noted, but not as steep at 30–50% and fishers still reportedly regularly capturing the species (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016; amended version of 2011 assessment to accommodate genus name change). Collectively, this suggests dramatic population declines of the Giant Freshwater Whipray in the Mekong River, and due to ongoing intensive fisheries pressure and severe habitat degradation and fisheries pressures, it is highly likely that declines have continued.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam, recent information has extended the known range of this species (Iqbal and Yustian 2016, Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the absence of time-series throughout this range extension it is difficult to determine population trend. Only a few specimens were observed during surveys in Sabah (Manjaji-Matsumoto 2002, Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016), and this species was not noted to be commonly caught by locals in either of the surveys. Whether this is due to population depletions, as observed for other species in Sabah during these surveys (e.g., sawfishes (Pristidae spp.) and river sharks (<em>Glyphis </em>spp.)), or limitations of local fishing gear and spatial survey effort is unclear. However, the species is fished in those regions and habitat degradation is also reported and ongoing and thus, it is likely the Giant Freshwater Whipray has also declined in those areas. In Java, due to the habitat degradation of the Citarum River, it is likely that population has declined.<br/><br/>Historic and current threats to this species are intensive and ongoing, and steep population declines of this species have been observed by fishers in parts of its range. The species has little refuge from fishing pressure and habitat degradation. It is suspected that the Giant Freshwater Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (24–66 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality.",Decreasing,"<p></p>The Giant Freshwater Whipray is endemic to Southeast Asia where it has a patchy distribution (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). In India, it occurs in the Ganges River (Ishihara <em>et al</em>. 1998) and has recently been observed in east Indian fish markets, reportedly captured by trawl fishers in the Hooghly River (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020). It also occurs in the Mahandi and Kandala Rivers, Cuttack, Odisha State, India (Fishwatcher 2001, OMMCOM NEWS 2010; K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 29 April 2021). In Bangladesh, it has been reported from the Sundarbans region and east and central coastal waters extending to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). Anecdotal information suggest that it also occurs upstream of coastal rivers in Bangladesh (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). In Myanmar, it has been reported in brackish waters of the Kaladan and Mayu Rivers in the Rakhine State (M. Mizrahi unpubl. data 2021) and possibly occurs within the Irrawaddy River Basin (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, G.M. Masam Billah pers. comm. 12 January 2021), however, all of these reports require further investigation.<br/><br/>In Thailand, it occurs in the Chao Phraya, Nan, Mae Khlong, Bangpakong (Bang Pakong), Tachin and Tapi (Tapee) Rivers (Vidthayano et al. 2016). It also occurs in the Mekong River Basin in Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos. It possibly occurs as far upstream on the Mekong as Chiang Khong in northern Thailand, where unidentified stingrays have been seen (Z. Hogan pers. comm. in Vidthayanon et al. 2016). In Malaysia, it is known from the Sembrong River on Peninsular Malaysia (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 30 April 2021). In Malaysia Borneo, it occurs in most of the rivers and adjoining coastline across Sabah and Sarawak (Fyler and Caira 2006, Yano et al. 2005, Manjaji-Matsumoto et al. 2016, Windusari et al. 2019) and it also occurs in Brunei Darussalam (Windusari et al. 2019).<br/><br/>In Kalimantan, Indonesia, it occurs throughout riverine and coastal habitats. In North Kalimantan, it has been reported in the Tarakan delta region, Berau River, and Talisayan River (Last et al. 2010, Iqbal et al. 2020). In East Kalimantan, it is known from the Mahakam and Pasir Rivers (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In West Kalimantan, it is known from the Kapuas River and surrounding coastline (Monkolprasit and Roberts 1990, C. Leh pers. comm. in Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Central Kalimantan, there are three records from coastal regions of the Barito and Sampit Rivers, suggesting that it likely occurs within rivers along Borneo’s southern coastline (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sumatra, Indonesia, it occurs in the Indragiri, Batanghari, Musi, and Kampar River Basins, as well as along the adjoining coastline of these systems (Iqbal et al. 2020, V. Hasan unpubl. data 2021). There are also two coastal records from islands off Riau, Indonesia (Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). The holotype of this species is from Java (Bleeker 1852), and since then there are two more records of this species in Java. One was collected from the Citarum River, by an aquarium trader, and another was collected from the coastal region of Palabuhanratu for Sea World Aquarium in Jakarata (Fahmi unpubl. data 2021).","The Giant Freshwater Whipray is reported from markets in India, West Bengal, Bangladesh, and possibly Myanmar, where it is sold for consumption and, at least in Bangladesh, exported (Sen <em>et al</em>. 2020, A.B. Haque and M. Mizrahi unpubl. data 2021). Skins from large rays, including this species, are exported from Bangladesh (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2021). In Thailand, this species is consumed and sold either fresh, smoked, or fermented (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is also targeted by sport fishing ventures (eco-tourism) in the Mae Khlong and Chao Phraya Rivers. Despite poor survival in aquaria, Giant Freshwater Whiprays are harvested for aquaria (Vidthayanon <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Indonesia, this species is often consumed fresh (Windusari <em>et al</em>. 2019, Iqbal <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sarawak Malaysia, this species is likely consumed or sold at markets as noted for other rays (Manjaji-Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 2016), and in Borneo, it is used for food with the cartilage also possibly used (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). <span style=""""></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In Indonesia, this species, along with two other freshwater ray species (White-edge Whipray and Marbled Whipray), is fully protected under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry decree No. P.20/2018 and the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries decree No. 1/2021. Implementation of species protections is, however, reportedly poor and use of destructive fishing methods such as poisons and electro-fishing is ongoing (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, this species may receive some protection in the Sundarbans Protected Areas, where regulations are monitored. In Thailand, the establishment of community no-fishing reserves may offer protection to this species (Koning et al. 2020), although the distribution of the Giant Freshwater Whipray in relation to these reserves is not understood.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters and occurs at depths of 0–60 m. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although  reconstructed landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–98% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). Its inshore habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in population declines. It is suspected that the Narrow Cowtail Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>","<p>The&#160;Narrow&#160;Cowtail Ray is demersal inshore on continental insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 60 m (KK Bineesh, unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 83 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~67 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is likely viviparous and size-at-birth is 19–26 cm DW  (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). As there is no information on this species' maximum age and maturity, generation length was inferred as 20 years based on data for the similarly sized Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen 2007).</p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Narrow Cowtail Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;Trawling is particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/02/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p></p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years&#160;(Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest regions of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juvenile rays are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The entire geographic distribution of this species in the Indian EEZ overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 9,981 boats operating in the small portion of the Indian coast this species occurs (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). There is high demand for the meat of this species in India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In India, where this species is found, there is ongoing mangrove destruction and coastal pollution (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. This species, while not a whipray, is caught in similar gears, depths, and habitats as whiprays, thus whipray landing trends can be used to infer population trends of the Narrow Cowtail Ray. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Narrow Cowtail Ray (60 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 88–98%.</p><p>There are three lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, and central Indonesia, and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Narrow Cowtail Ray in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in rays from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t, of which ~3% were cowtail rays. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg per hr to 0.24 in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Trawl fisheries have expanded rapidly since then (K. V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 07/02/2017). This species used to be frequently encountered in India in the late 1990s but is now considered rare with large population declines suspected (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Narrow Cowtail Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Narrow Cowtail Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (60 years) and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Narrow Cowtail Ray has a patchy distribution&#160;throughout the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans and is found from West Bengal to Bangladesh and from Thailand to Malaysia (Last&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019).","The flesh of the Narrow Cowtail Ray is in high demand in India and is used fresh or salted, dried, and/or smoked for human consumption throughout its range (K.K. Bineesh and A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). For other <em>Pastinachus </em>species, vertebrae are dried and exported, and the skin is dried and used for wallets, belts, shoes, handbags (high value) etc. most of which are exported (White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006); this likely also occurs with this species (Last <em>et al. </em>2010).",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). In Myanmar. In 2004, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 28/04/2020). <br/>In India, the Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K.

Overall, there are a limited number of specimens reported. It is believed to occur in inshore waters where it is captured in gillnet, line and trawl fisheries within its range. Its recent re-discovery and re-description means that historically it has likely been under-recorded, however reliable identification of <em>Carcharhinus</em> species since then indicates that this species is rare and localised.<br/><br/>Although there are limited data on its status, similar commercially important <em>Carcharhinus</em> species in the Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') have undergone significant declines. One of the areas in which the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is known from (southern Oman/eastern Yemen) has been, and continues to be, subject to intensive fishing targeted at sharks, suggesting suspected population declines of 50-80% are appropriate for this species. The other known centre of abundance around Kuwait is also subject to habitat degradation and change from water management practices in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Furthermore, the loss and modification of coastal habitats in the Gulf is a significant concern for inshore species such as this. A further population reduction is suspected over three generation lengths (2017-2042) based on current levels of exploitation. The limited geographic range of this species compared to other similar ""blacktip"" species increase the risks to this species. As such it is assessed as Endangered under criterion A2cd+3cd. Further research and monitoring are required to better understand the distribution, biology, ecology and population status of this species.","There is limited information available on this species because of the limited number of specimens recorded. Its maximum size is 165 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Females are mature by at least 131 cm TL and demonstrate placental viviparity with litters of 4-6 embryos. In the northwestern Gulf, there is evidence that parturition occurs in spring when embryos are 35-51 cm TL. Further records of the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark from the western Arabian Sea indicate that adults are present in this region throughout the year.<br/><br/>No ageing data are available for the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark. Generation length is estimated to be 8.25 years based on the Spottail Shark from Australia&#160;which has a similar maximum size. The Spottail Shark matures at 2-3 years and reaches a maximum age of 14 years (Davenport and Stevens 1988).","The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is likely to be taken by inshore gillnet, line and trawl fisheries within its range given it is known only from specimens from fish markets (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015). One of the known centres of abundance around Kuwait is also subject to habitat degradation and change from water management practices in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Marine habitats in the Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2010) which is likely to impact this species.","The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is morphologically very similar to the Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>C. sorrah</em>) and the Graceful Shark (<em>C. amblyrhynchoides</em>) and there is likely to have been confusion in species identification across its potential range. It was only recently rediscovered in Kuwaiti landings (2009), with subsequent confirmed records across the Gulf and in Oman (Moore <em>et al. </em>2013). There is no species-specific information on population size or structure.<br/><br/>Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab <em>et al.</em> 2006). Historical surveys in the Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980-81, whereas in 2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Similarly, results from interviews with fishermen in the UAE indicate that the majority of fishers started seeing a decline in the abundance of sharks over 20 years ago, and that these declines have been significant (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015). Declines in the order of 30-50% in commercially important shark species such as <em>C. limbatus</em> and <em>C. sorrah </em>are suspected. Furthermore, one of the areas in which&#160;Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark&#160;is known from (southern Oman/eastern Yemen) has been, and continues to be, subject to intensive targeted shark fishing (Bonfil 2001). Therefore, although the status of the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark remains unknown, based on the significant decline in other similar species in the region, population declines of 50–80% are suspected over a period of three generation spans (~25 years). A further population reduction is suspected over three generation lengths (2017–2042) based on current levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is endemic to the Arabian Seas region, occurring in the northern Indian Ocean, including the Gulf (UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain), Sea of Oman and Arabian Sea (Oman and Yemen).","<p>The meat of this species may be sold fresh for human consumption at local markets in the region. In some countries, such as Oman and Yemen, the meat is cut into fillets, dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries.

Some countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Kuwait and Saudi Arabia).

Its extent of occurrence is estimated to be less than 2,000 km², and it is known from three distinct locations in that range. Shrimp trawls operate across the entire distribution of the species, with a suspected continuing decline in the number of mature individuals from bycatch mortality in ongoing indiscriminate trawling (survivorship of discarded electric rays is low). It is thus assessed as Endangered under criterion B1ab(v).","The Aden Torpedo occurs on the narrow continental shelf of the Yemen Gulf of Aden coastline, being recorded from depths of 26-230 m&#160;(Carvalho&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;The species is known from only a handful of specimens (n=5) and so little is known of its biology.

It is also potentially caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries along the Yemeni coast.","Population size and trends for this species are unknown, but its restricted distribution implies that the population size is small.

It is caught as bycatch in inshore and shelf trawl and gillnet fisheries. Most of the distribution of the species is under extremely intense and increasing demersal fishing pressure. For example, the number of trawlers operating in Gujarat waters has increased from ~6,600 boats in 2004 to ~11,500 boats in 2010, and about 2,000 trawlers operate in Pakistan shelf waters. Significant declines of rays have been documented on the west coast of India, including eagle rays. Furthermore, the loss and modification of coastal habitats in the&#160;Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf')&#160;is a significant concern for inshore species such as this.&#160;The relative rarity, large size, low productivity, and relatively small range of the Ocellate Eagle Ray makes it particularly susceptible to an overall population decline as a result of fishing pressure and habitat loss. It is suspected that this species has undergone declines of 50% or more over the last three generations (~45 years), and with ongoing fishing pressure and habitat degradation and loss, future population declines are suspected over the next three generations (2017-2062).&#160;It is therefore assessed as Endangered under criterion A2d+3d.","The biology of the Ocellate Eagle Ray is poorly known, but it likely inhabits inshore areas over soft bottoms to depths of 90 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Weigmann 2016). This eagle ray displays aggregating behaviour. It reaches a maximum size of 123 cm disc width (DW), and males mature at 50 cm DW (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 09/02/2017). Female maturity and size at birth are unknown. The species is suspected to have low fecundity as with other eagle rays, which bear litters of up to four offspring (Compagno and Last 1999, Last and Stevens 2009). As there is no information on this species' maximum age and age at maturity, generation length was inferred as ~15 years based on data for the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) which are reported to have a maximum age of 24 years and an age at maturity of five years (Martin and Cailliet 1988). However, it is&#160;noted&#160;that&#160;the Ocellate Eagle Ray reaches a smaller maximum size than this species.","In the region, the Ocellate Eagle Ray occurs in areas of intense demersal trawl activity. Limited information is available on catches of the Ocellate Eagle Ray as species-specific data are usually not recorded, however, the high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). This species is also threatened by being caught while aggregating in inshore gillnets across its range.<br/><br/>Marine habitats in the Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010) which is likely to impact this species.","There is no species-specific information on population size or structure. This species comprised 0.45-1% of elasmobranchs in landings in Kuwait and Qatar in 2008 and 2009. The species was not recorded on a subsequent survey in Kuwait in 2011 (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Bahrain, it represented less than 0.7% of elasmobranch landings (Moore and Peirce 2013). In the UAE, it represented 8.9% of batoid landings surveyed between 2010 and 2012 (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 09/02/2017). Data from elsewhere is sparse but it does not appear to be common.<br/><br/>The population is suspected to have declined off Iran, Pakistan and India (Gujarat) due to increased fishing pressure. In India and Pakistan, there is an overall decline in batoids from intense fishing.&#160;For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a similar (63%) decline in landings of the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>), which is equivalent to an ~96% decline over a period of three generations (45 years) of the Ocellate Eagle Ray.<br/><br/>It is suspected that similar pressure is ongoing in Gujarat (India) and Pakistan where trawler numbers are high (see the <em>Threats</em> section). Pressure is lower in some other parts of its range (parts of the Gulf, Oman), but this species is apparently rare with similar catchability to more numerous species such as the closely-related Banded Eagle Ray (<em>A. nichofii</em>). Overall, across its range, a decline of 50% or more is suspected over a period of three generation spans of the Ocellate Eagle Ray (~45 years), and future population declines are suspected over the next three generations (2017-2062) &#160;<p><br/></p><p>                   </p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Ocellate Eagle Ray is endemic to the Arabian Seas region, occurring from Oman to India (Gujarat), including the Gulf (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

121739077,191108,Anguilla rostrata,Endangered,A2bd,2017,2013-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Anguilla rostrata</em> exhibits facultative catadromy, has multiple life stages, is semelparous and panmictic; these life history traits make application of the IUCN Red List Criteria more challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater: this element of the population is particularly poorly understood in most species.<br/><br/>Ideally, the IUCN Red List Criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds and in the absence of such data, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of American Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but datasets for this are very rare. The majority of available data for this species relates to yellow eel recruitment but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List Criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which may not exactly mirror the mature spawning stock but can be used as the current best estimate. Finally, the American Eel is a panmictic species (i.e., all individuals come from one spawning stock); as such escapement from a specific water body/country/region is not directly correlated to the subsequent corresponding recruitment to the same area. However, as data are only available from certain parts of the species' range - data are particularly sparse for Caribbean and Central American populations, and those associated with the Gulf of Mexico - it is important that conservation initiatives and management actions are adjusted as new data become available. <br/><br/>Available data for this species indicates that, overall, there have been declines in recruitment, population and escapement over the period of three generations (36 years). However, the majority of data are for young yellow eels and the data available for older yellow eel populations and, most importantly, escaping silver eels, are limited and do not encompass the entire range of the species. These issues have been taken into account during the assessment process, and it would seem that applying criteria A2bd, as the limited available data indicates, the American Eel has seen a ~50% decline in silver eel escapement over three generations and thus is on the cusp of the Vulnerable and Endangered categories. Data relating to yellow eel recruitment and yellow eel populations would indicate that these metrics have declined to a slightly greater degree (50-60%) over three generations.<br/><br/>There are a suite of threats that have been implicated in causing the decline of American Eel recruitment and stocks; barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines; poor body condition; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly <em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation and trade of glass, yellow and silver eels; hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation. The impacts of these threats individually or synergistically, are likely regionally specific, however, more broadly, climate and ocean currents have been suggested to play an important role in the survival of the leptocephalus larvae and recruitment of glass eels to coastal, brackish and freshwater habitat. Further research is required to fully understand the complexities of this particular aspect of the eel's life history but there are conflicting opinions as to the degree, if any, to which oceanic factors contribute to declines in eel numbers.<br/><br/>To date, the American Eel is not protected under any global treaties or conventions (e.g., CITES). However, in Canada, COSEWIC reviewed the status of the American Eel and revised the Canadian status from “Special Concern” in 2006, to “Threatened” in 2012. The Canadian government has commenced a response by initiating a Recovery Potential Assessment Review. In 2007, eels in Ontario were classified as “Endangered” under the Ontario Endangered Species Act and a Recovery Strategy was developed with an emphasis on restoring, protecting, and diversifying suitable habitat. The Ontario government is currently preparing a formal Response Statement addressing the recommendations in the Recovery Strategy. In the U.S, a review by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service is due to be completed in 2015 that will determine whether a listing of the species as Threatened, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), is warranted.<br/><br/>Utilising the available historical data from range states, and taking into account the continued threats to this species, it was deemed appropriate to assign an IUCN listing of Endangered, using IUCN Red List Criteria, under past and current observations of population decline (A2bd). However, it is imperative to highlight that recruitment is increasing in some sites and that should management actions relating to anthropogenic threats prove effective, and/or there are positive effects of natural influences on the various life stages of this species, a listing of Vulnerable would be achievable. Further, a drive to fill data gaps – particularly in the southern range of this species - would increase the robustness of the assessment of this species. Another point to make is that it was not felt that the species was in immediate risk of extinction due to the wide geographic ranges they inhabit. However, this is not to say there wasn’t concern as to the species status being ‘outside of safe biological limits’- for this assessment, ‘risk’ is determined based on past and present population levels.<br/><br/>Assessment of the population data was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from July 1st-5th 2013.","<em><strong>Habitat</strong></em>: <br/>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons, coastal waters and possibly further offshore. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea, although it is stocked elsewhere. American eels are sometimes found in landlocked lakes, particularly in the northeast U.S. (Facey and Van Den Avyle 1987). The latitudinal range of the American Eel is extremely broad, from 5°N to 60°N (Bertin 1956), and their range covers approximately 30,000 km of coastline. The American Eel is thought to occupy the broadest range of habitats of any fish in the world (Helfman <em>et al</em>. 1987).<br/><br/>As both larvae and adults, the American Eel migrates through and spawns in the ocean. Research has indicated that coastal and estuarine waters could be appropriate habitat for eels within the species' range (Chaput <em>et al</em>. 2014). It has further been suggested that, as a result of this fact, only a small proportion of available habitat is subject to the threat of exploitation (Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2012). Indeed, the yellow/silver eel fishery in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence was estimated to harvest about 7–8% of the standing stock biomass over the period of 1997–2008 (Chaput <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, it was felt that to make the assumption that this habitat is populated simply because it is theoretically appropriate is a risky strategy in terms of conservation. As such, and as was also the case for the other anguillid assessments, a precautionary approach has been employed and only areas where data on the presence of eels was available has been included in analysis.<br/><br/><em><strong>Ecology</strong></em>: <br/>As a catadromous species, American Eels use marine habitats for migration to their spawning area, spawning, and egg and larval phases. There is evidence that American Eels are facultatively catadromous, and yellow eels use estuarine—and possibly marine—habitats during the growth phase. Little is known about the precise spawning habitat of the American Eel. Spawning location is inferred based on size of the leptocephali - the larval stage of anguillid eels - with the smallest leptocephali captured over a relatively large 550 km arc in the southern Sargasso Sea within the frontal area of the Subtropical Convergence Zone (ASMFC 2012, DFO 2014). The northern limit of spawning appears to be defined by temperature fronts separating surface water masses with high temperature and higher-saline water to the south and seasonally cooled, lower-saline water to the north (McCleave <em>et al</em>. 1987, Kleckner and McCleave 1988, Munk <em>et al</em>. 2010). These highly dynamic fronts vary in shape and locations within months and between years.<br/><br/>Breeding in the wild has never been observed, however, based on size of the leptocephali that have been captured, spawning activity occurs in late winter and early spring, with the smallest leptocephali being present in February to April. The Sargasso Sea is a high-salinity (~36.6 ppt) region with warm surface temperatures ranging from 18 to 24°C (Kleckner and McCleave 1985, Kleckner and McCleave 1988). Some evidence suggests that American Eels may spawn in the upper 150–200 metres of the water column (Kleckner <em>et al</em>. 1983, Kleckner and McCleave 1985). Leptocephali, drift and swim with prevailing currents (Antilles Current, Florida Current, and Gulf Stream), which take them to areas near continental coasts or continental-slope waters. The leptocephali undergo metamorphosis and develop into glass eels. Eventually glass eels metamorphose into elvers, a smaller version of yellow eels. It is believed that metamorphosis from leptocephali to glass eels occurs in the first year primarily at the edge of the continental shelf; active transport is thought to be necessary for leptocephali and glass eels to exit the Gulf Stream. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, migration of glass eels is 10–15 km/day primarily at night (Dutil <em>et al</em>. 2009). Leptocephali and glass eels appear to be tolerant of a wide range of temperatures and salinities.<br/><br/>While many American Eels appear to migrate into freshwater, some settle in estuaries or near-shore coastal waters and may complete their yellow phase without ever entering and remaining in freshwater (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2008, Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009). Jessop <em>et al</em>. (2009) reviewed studies which used otolith microchemistry to investigate lifetime use of salinity zones by American Eels; eels can be divided into residents of freshwater, residents of brackish or salt water, and shifters between these habitats. Secor <em>et al</em>. (2002) found these three modes of habitat use by yellow-phase eels in the Hudson River. Despite knowledge of these modes, there is still little known about the American eels’ use of the nearshore marine environment, but there are some reports of small numbers of eels being captured in Canadian brackish waters in early summer, suggesting that they are not emigrating individuals. These captures have occurred at a wide range of depths, including at locations &gt;100 m deep (DFO 2014).<br/><br/>Movement into freshwater may be the result of a density-dependent process (Haro and Krueger 1991, Feunteun <em>et al</em>. 2003), with the largest immigrating pulses migrating farthest (Ibbotson <em>et al</em>. 2002, Casselman 2003). Glass eels enter estuaries and a proportion of these move upstream to spend the majority of their life growing as yellow eels in rivers, streams, ponds, freshwater marshes and the shallow, more productive areas of lakes (DFO 2014). Environmental predictors of glass eel runs are variable, but increased temperature and reduced flow may trigger upstream movement (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009). This immigration begins when water temperatures reach 10°C and continue until temperatures exceed 20°C, though lower temperatures can decrease migratory activity (Martin 1995). Glass eels appear to be attracted to flowing water with a current velocity &lt;25-40 cm/sec (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Significant environmental, temporal and spatial factors affect the distribution of the American Eel, including the distribution of habitat areas (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009). Greene <em>et al</em>. emphasized that much of the American Eel habitat has not been well quantified and has been considerably affected by human actions. Yellow eels have a primarily benthic orientation, use substrate (rock, sand, silt, and mud) and other structures such as woody debris and submerged vegetation (well-documented Vallisneria, eelgrass) for protection and cover. Casselman (2003) reports that historically in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, eels constituted half the inshore (&lt;10 m) fish biomass.<br/><br/>Yellow-phase American Eels spend 3 to 30 or more years inland or in coastal areas before becoming mature, entering the silver phase (Daverat <em>et al</em>. 2006, MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). Silvering eels emigrate from freshwater estuaries and near-shore coastal areas back to the open ocean and migrate to their spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. The timing of silver eel downstream migration occurs on a latitudinal cline, with eels leaving the Canadian provinces in summer through fall and from fall to early winter in the southern U.S. depending upon location. Emigration appears to occur over a narrow timeframe, usually a few months and appears to be initiated by environmental factors such as water temperature, river or stream discharge, water level and/or precipitation events, and light intensity, including moon phase (DFO 2014). Silver eels emigrate from estuaries at water temperatures ranging from 10 to 18°C, with a laboratory preference of 17°C (Haro 1991). During this migration, silver eels appear to remain relatively near the ocean surface; they have been captured in November and December in depths ranging from 9 to 82 m and at water temperatures from 8 to 12°C (DFO 2014). Physiological changes associated with silvering have been reviewed by Facey and Van Den Avyle (1987) and include a change in colour to a metallic bronze-black sheen, pectoral fin change from yellow-green to black, increased body fat content, thickening of the skin, increased length of the capillaries in the rete gland of the swim bladder and degeneration of the digestive tract. Additionally, the eyes become larger and the visual pigments in the eye are altered (Vladykov 1973, Beatty 1975). These changes are thought to better suit the American Eel for migration at depth.<br/><br/>The American Eel is tolerant of a wide range of temperatures. In Chesapeake Bay, it has been captured at temperatures ranging from 3 to 31°C, with the greatest occurrence at 16–28°C (DFO 2014). Water temperature is important in the seasonal activity of eels; in winter, when temperatures are &lt;5°C, eels bury themselves in soft substrate and are believed to enter a state of torpor (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Atlantic Canada, some eels that are resident in brackish and salt water remain there in winter, but wintering migrations from salt to fresh water are also known (Jessop <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tomie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although American Eels lack plasma antifreeze, they commonly overwinter in areas where water temperatures fall below the freezing point of fish blood, apparently by taking advantage of warmer temperatures found in bottom mud (Tomie 2011). The occurrence of eels may also be affected by dissolved oxygen levels. Catches are most abundant in waters where dissolved oxygen is &gt;4 mg/L. Any decrease in oxygen concentration will negatively affect growth and production (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009). Barriers that restrict or impede upstream movement lead to increased concentrations of eels immediately downstream. It has been suggested that higher densities of eels in these regions can increase cannibalism, predation, and competition for food and have a negative effect on growth and ultimately size and fecundity (DFO 2014). However, small eels, &lt;10 cm in length, can traverse vertical or nearly vertical wet barriers (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Sex determination in anguillids is, at least to some extent, environmentally determined and appears to be a function of density and growth rate, with males occurring at higher local population densities (Krueger and Oliveira 1999, Davey and Jellyman 2005). Consequently and like other species of freshwater eels, regional sex bias is common in the American Eel, potentially exacerbating the impact of localised threats. The once large and abundant eel stock of the upper St. Lawrence River–Lake Ontario system was exclusively females that were large, old, and potentially highly fecund (Casselman 2003). As such, it has been argued that the northern portion of the geographic range of the American Eel may contribute a great proportion of the reproductive potential to this panmictic species because of apparent increases in average female size and female bias with latitude (Barbin and McCleave 1997). With this apparent increase in length and weight comes an increase in fecundity for eels residing at higher latitudes with a single large female caught in a river in Maine reported to contain 21.95 million eggs (Barbin and McCleave 1997). Counter to these arguments, however, is the contention that individuals at lower latitudes grow more quickly, reaching maturity at a younger age, and are more abundant and have a shorter generation time than at more northern latitudes (ASMFC 2012). Even though the individuals are smaller, this may result in a greater overall reproductive capacity.<br/><br/>To assess decline in a species with a complex life history such as anguillid eels, it is important to be able to estimate generation time for the species. Generation lengths for American Eels can vary considerably. American Eels living in brackish habitats, on average, grow 2.2 times faster than freshwater residents, possibly because of increased food resources and better osmotic conditions (Jessop <em>et al</em>. 2002). Consequently eels in freshwater habitats have extended times to maturity and are therefore more vulnerable (freshwater, 22 yr; estuaries 9 yr – Lamson <em>et al</em>. 2009). This is complicated by the fact that the species inhabits a broad range of latitudes, producing widely varied growth rates and ages at silvering (Jessop 2010).<br/><br/>Comparisons of eels commercially harvested at inland areas (St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario) with those harvested along Atlantic coast provinces revealed that average lengths range from 80.3 to 46.3 cm and average ages from 17.5 to 10.6 between freshwater and estuarine or brackish habitats, respectively (Casselman 2003). The temperature-size rule (increase in body size at lower temperatures) applies to American Eel females, but not males (Jessop 2010). Upper and lower bound estimates for silver eel age are provided from a broad study by Jessop (2010), who suggests minimum mean ages of 5.8 years for females (Charleston Harbour, SC) and 3.1 years for males (Altamaha River, GA). Maximum age estimates were 22.6 for females (Rivière du Sud-Ouest, Quebec) and 15.4 for males (East River, Chester, N.S.). Commercially harvested yellow eels from the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario usually ranged in age from 17 to 26 years (Casselman unpub. data). Summary data on later-stage yellow eel ages from commercial fisheries (Casselman 2003) indicate that in northern locations, the range is 4-43 yr (St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario and Atlantic coastal provinces) and in the Atlantic coastal states of the U.S., 2-20 yr. These data suggest that upper and lower estimates of three generations for this global assessment of <em>A. rostrata</em> should be in the region of 65–70 yr and 8–10 yr. The ASMFC Benchmark Stock Assessment (2012) indicated that a generation time for eels in the south is 3–5 yr and, in the north, 10–20 yr.<br/><br/>A more precise estimate of generation time could be made by combining individual estimates for various regions. Ten general regions were selected to estimate generation time across the range of the species. These regions and generation times are: 1) Caribbean islands – 4 yr; 2) Gulf of Mexico – 6 yr; 3) southern Atlantic states – 8 yr; 4) central Atlantic states – 10 yr; 5) northern Atlantic states – 12 yr; 6) Scotia-Fundy – 14 yr; 7) southern Gulf of St. Lawrence – 16 yr; 8) northern Gulf of St. Lawrence – 18 yr; 9) St. Lawrence River system and basin – 20 yr; 10) Mississippi River system – 12 yr. These estimates come from an extensive review of ages in the published literature. Comparing mean age of female silver eels and estimated generation time in seven regions ranging from the St. Lawrence River Basin to the southern Atlantic states provided in the Recovery Potential Assessment (DFO 2014), there was a highly significant correlation with a slope not significantly different than 1 with the estimated generation time provided here. From these data, it was concluded that a mean overall generation time for the American Eel could be estimated to be 12 yr.<br/><br/>General estimates of generation time used by others confirm the aforementioned estimates. In the DFO Recovery Potential Assessment (2014), it was considered that one generation time for American Eeels in Canada is approximately 16 yr. The ASMFC Benchmark Stock Assessment (2012) considered that 8–10 yr would be a good estimate for U.S. jurisdictions encompassed by the ASMFC.<br/><span lang=""EN-CA""><p></p>","Many have detailed the pressures that are believed to have caused, through synergistic interactions, the decline in recruitment, standing stock, and ultimately in the production of spawners of the American Eel. In an extensive review of status of the American Eel in Canada, COSEWIC (2012) identified the threats as: 1) barriers in freshwater resulting in the accumulative loss of formerly productive habitats; 2) turbine mortality of hydroelectric dams; 3) vulnerability of life stages to fisheries; 4) bioaccumulation of contaminants; 5) exotic swimbladder nematode parasite (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) potentially introduced from stocking; 6) climate change and shifting oceanic conditions. A recent report indicated that barriers to migration and fisheries were likely the greatest threats across the species’ range, while other threats would have more regional influences (Chaput <em>et al</em>. 2014). Many of the current major stressors affecting <em>A. rostrata </em>in North America are those facing other species of anguillid eels. Large barriers severely impede upstream migration of juvenile eels if no passage is provided, extirpating large areas of habitat suitable for growth and maturation of freshwater eels. Although eels are able to ascend many smaller barriers, recent studies have documented a tenfold reduction in eel density above each potentially passable barrier (Machut <em>et al</em>. 2007). Machut <em>et al</em>. also found significantly lower American Eel condition with increasing riparian urbanization in the Hudson River in the U.S.<br/><br/>Habitat loss resulting from impoundment may contribute to reduced eel abundance in eastern Canada (Jessop 2000). In the St Lawrence watershed alone, 13% (14,000 km²) of yellow eel rearing habitat is no longer accessible (DFO 2014). However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s a number of eel ladders were constructed on barriers which attempted to reduce this loss. Throughout the United States, it is reported that as much as 84% of historic stream length is now inaccessible to eels (DFO 2014). The Susquehanna River, the largest river system on the East Coast of the U.S., once supported a large numbers of eels; however the construction of Conowingo Dam, a large hydroelectric dam located near the mouth of the river as well as additional upstream dams severely limited the access to this habitat (SRAFRC 2010). Major habitat perturbations in the St. Lawrence River took place in the 1950s (e.g., construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway and hydroelectric dams), about 30 years before recruitment started declining; this long delay argues against these perturbations being primary causes of the decline (Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). However, an unpublished, long-term CPUE series (1930–1965) provides evidence that the decline occurred simultaneously with the habitat alterations (see Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). Irrespective of the causes of declines, it has been proposed that changes in flow regulation, along with changes in temperature, have affected migration behaviour (e.g., Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Passage through turbines at hydropower dams during downstream migration represents a major source of eel mortality (Ritter <em>et al</em>. 1997). Turbine-induced mortality ranges from 5 to 97%, depending on turbine type, flow rate, and length of the fish (Hadderingh 1990, McCleave pers. comm., Bussye <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cumulative direct turbine mortality from the two large hydroelectric dams on the St. Lawrence River system (Moses-Saunders and Beauharnois) accounts for a mortality of 40% of the emigrating eels (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). This had a substantial impact on spawner escapement from this once large, highly fecund northern population. Without development of suitable eel passage at hydroelectric dams, such mortality continually affects escapement at all hydroelectric facilities across the entire range.<br/><br/>The commercial harvest of all continental life stages of eels has been, and remains, a cause of significant mortality (see the <em>Use and Trade</em> section above for details). How accurately, effort-based commercial harvest data represent true population trends however, remains a strong discussion point due to the potential carrying capacity of unfished habitat. However, for the purposes of the current assessment, these areas, while being recognised as having potential importance, were not considered unless fisheries-independent monitoring data was available. Worldwide demand for eels is greater than can be supplied by harvest of wild populations, and eel farming – widespread in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China and to a lesser extent in Europe – has become a major source of marketable eels (Jessop 2000). In Asia, wild-caught glass eels and elvers are farmed to marketable size. Since captive reproduction of American eels is not yet feasible (although see Oliveira and Hable 2010), the intensive farming industry in East Asia is dependent upon an annual supply of wild-caught glass eels and elvers (Moriarty and Dekker 1997). When Asian domestic stocks are inadequate, a strong market develops for American Eels. The Asian market for American glass eels and elvers was strong from 1972 to 1977, declined dramatically in 1978, began to strengthen in the 1990s, and is now at record-high levels (Crook and Nakamura 2013). Increased worldwide demand for glass eels and elvers has led to increased poaching of the American Eel in the United States (ASMFC 2013) though the extent of this is difficult to quantify.<br/><br/>In addition to threats from harvest, they also face other challenges. American Eels from the St. Lawrence River have historically been identified as being heavily contaminated with chemicals such as PCBs, Mirex, and various pesticides (Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994, Couillard <em>et al</em>. 1997, Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). Lethal toxicity from chemical contamination has been known to occur in St. Lawrence eels for more than 30 years (Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1998). The highest concentrations of chemicals in migrating silver eels in the St. Lawrence River are in the gonads; chemical levels in eggs could exceed the thresholds of toxicity for larvae (Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994). Due to PCB body burdens in eels, commercial harvest of eels for human consumption has been banned throughout the Hudson River south of Glen’s Falls, NY; however, PCBs are currently being removed from the Hudson River. More recent studies indicate that levels of toxins are lower (Byer, Alaee <em>et al</em>. 2013), and while in some cases the negative effects are considered to be minimal (e.g. dioxins; Byer, Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2013), there is still regional concern in relation to other xenobiotics.<br/><br/>Oceanic effects on long-term patterns of American Eel recruitment are poorly understood, but they may play a role in the changing abundance of eels along the Atlantic coast of North America (Castonguay, Hodson, Moriarty <em>et al</em>. 1994). At the larval stage, changes in marine primary production and thus food availability associated with climate change have been suggested as a cause of population decline in the American as well as the European and Japanese Eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008). Changes in frontal locations or oceanic currents may also play a role in determining recruitment to the coast (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). It has recently been discovered that predation of adult eels may be a further impact in the oceanic environment (Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2012, Wahlberg <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Given the relative lack of understanding of the threats we have attempted to quantify this using the IUCN ‘Threat Classification Scheme’ coding, however, this is by no means definitive.","Data were primarily collated from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Eel Benchmark Stock Assessment (ASMFC 2012) – the body that manages American Eel stocks along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. - and from the DFO (Canada’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans) Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) report (DFO 2014). There were very few data that related to the Southern extent of the species’ range – Central America / Caribbean – and this was taken into account during discussions. Data that were eel-specific (i.e., not part of a multi-species fishery) and/or collected as part of fisheries independent scientific monitoring or fisheries dependent data with an associated metric of effort (e.g., catch per unit effort) were given greater weight than data sets that did not meet these criteria. Catch effort can be variable in fishing data and under-reporting, and in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings is a serious problem; thus while landings data are discussed, in the absence of other data, it cannot be accepted as a precise measure of stock status. Data were analysed to assess trends in recruitment, population and spawner escapement, however, they were primarily used to guide further discussions that included threats and associated management measures. These and the associated review inputs resulted in the consensus of the ‘Endangered’ listing by assessors, contributors and reviewers.<br/><br/>According to a regional assessment and status report by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), eel abundance has seen significant declines in the last 50 years, and COSEWIC assessed the Canadian population that receives recruitment at the northernmost part of the species' range as ‘Threatened’ (COSEWIC 2012). During the ASMFC Baseline Stock Assessment for American Eel, nearly 100 fishery-dependent and independent U.S. data sources representing several life stages and geographical and temporal scales were evaluated. Ultimately, fifty-two fishery-dependent and independent data sources were selected for use in this assessment because they were considered adequate for describing life history characteristics and abundance trends of eels on either a coast-wide or regional basis. The assessment concluded that in the US the American Eel stock is depleted with the stock being at or near historically low levels (ASMFC 2012). To provide a note of historical context, Haro <em>et al</em>. (2000) analysed commercial and non-commercial data to determine population trends of <em>A. rostrata</em> along the east coast American/Canadian range from Ontario and Nova Scotia down to Virginia. Of the 16 localities analysed between the years 1984 and 1995, seven areas showed significant declines in population numbers using Mann-Kendall trend analysis, while the remaining nine were non- significant.<br/><br/>Further to this, time series data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the FAO provide details of fisheries declines in the American Eel from the southern part of its range. In Florida, a state that has sustained an eel fishery on record since 1950, numbers were highest between 1975 and 1980, with average annual catches peaking at 213 t. The last reported figures for this fishery were from 2007 with an average of 2.11 t in the five preceding years (NMFS NOAA 2012, FAO 2012). Further south, Cuba reported 0.5–1.0 t annually during the 1980s and early 1990s, but no eel catches have been reported to FAO since 1995. Conversely, in the Dominican Republic, fishing for eels is relatively recent with first records appearing in 1995 (five year average = 4 t). From 2006 to 2011 this figure has increased to 22 t. Figures from the western Atlantic Coast in Mexico began in 1984 and are characterised by long inter-annual periods of no eels caught. The most consistent periods were 1995 to 2000 with an average catch of 18 t per year before falling back to zero (NMFS NOAA 2012, FAO 2012). In 2011, an anomaly in this term saw a remarkable 140 t caught suggesting a sudden surge in effort. These fluctuating values from the southern part of the American Eel range perhaps reflect changes and surges in demand from abroad, which can quickly drive up the price of eels (see the <em>Use and Trade</em> section below). According to a 50-year average, the southern states of the U.S. contribute just 10 t per year to a commercial fishery with a combined total catch between Canada and the US averaging 1,564 t per year (Casselman 2003). Thus, fisheries-dependent data suggest that eels in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. and eastern Canada contribute disproportionally to the overall panmictic population (Barbin and McCleave 1997).<br/><br/><em><strong>Glass eels/young yellow eels</strong></em>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: East River Chester (NS, Canada), Little Egg Inlet (NJ, United States), Beaufort Inlet (NC, United States). Moses Saunders, upper St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario recruitment (ON and NY, Canada/United States), Richelieu River/Chambly Dam (QC, Canada), Highlands River and Northeast Brook (NL, Canada), Trepassey (NL, Canada), Rivière du Sud-Ouest (QC, Canada), Long Island (NY, United States), Hudson Estuary (NY, United States), Delaware River (NJ, United States), Delaware River (DE, United States), Chesapeake Bay (MD, United States), Lower Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries (VA, United States), North Carolina trawl survey (NC, United States).<br/><br/>Recruitment of young eels to areas of historically high abundance, such as the St. Lawrence River watershed, has been in decline for some time (Casselman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Casselman 2003). More recently some of these declines have slowed and appear to have stabilised and some watersheds have recently exhibited increasing trends in glass eels and elvers, but these have yet to manifest themselves as increases in continental populations (DFO 2014). This means that the population at this locality is potentially more vulnerable to future threats because of very low abundance. A few long-term data sets from eel ladders are available, and these have shown a major decline in recruitment. A severe decline has occurred in the number of eels ascending the eel ladder at the Moses-Saunders Dam (Ontario-New York) during the peak spring migration in the St. Lawrence River-Lake Ontario segment of the range (Castonguay, Hodson <em>et al</em>. 1994, Casselman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Casselman 2003, COSEWIC, 2006). The number of juvenile eels climbing the eel ladder declined from more than one million per year in the early 1980s to fewer than 4,000 per year in the late 1990s and to a level approaching zero by 2001. Larger numbers of eels have begun climbing the ladders again starting in 2004 indicating a reversing trend (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the US, there has been monitoring in the Hudson Estuary since the mid-1970s – this is fisheries independent but not species specific. Catches of glass eels/elvers indicate that there has been a significant decline in recruitment over this period. Further south, the situation in the Chesapeake and Delaware bays are less clear cut, over three generations, with some indices showing declines, others stable and some exhibiting increased recruitment. However, the general trend is that of a recruitment decline in this part of the US.<br/><br/>The American Eel exists in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean islands, and some Atlantic coastal areas of North and South America, however data for these regions is scant. Commercial fisheries have existed in Mexico and the Caribbean islands, specifically the Dominican Republic. FAO and FishStatJ indicate that harvest in Mexico and the Caribbean islands increased dramatically in the mid-1990s correlating with the decline in the Canadian harvest. In 2011 harvest in both jurisdictions reached a record-high, approaching almost 20% of total harvest of the American Eel (Casselman unpub. data). Evidence is that this harvest was exported to Asia for culture. This increase could be attributed to increasing abundance, but price and demand for American glass eels and elvers has increased substantially in recent years, likely due to the export of the European Eel outside of the EU being banned in 2010. As such it is more than likely that this demand for young American Eels for export is driving this increased harvest.<br/><br/>Overall, despite regional variations, and in some cases, signs of stabilisation and/or recovery in the recent past, the general picture across the data sets used, was that over the period of three generations analysed there had been a significant decline in recruitment across the species' range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Older yellow eels</em></strong>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: Bay of Quinte (ON, Canada) St Lawrence River (ON, Canada), Miramichi River, (NB Canada), Gulf of St Lawrence (Canada), Upper Mississippi River (United States).<br/><br/>All five of the data sets indicated that there had been declining trend in continental yellow eel populations over the period of three generations. Fisheries-dependent data indicate that eel harvest declines first occurred along the Atlantic Seaboard of the U.S. in the mid to late-1980s, followed by a decline in the mid-1990s in Canadian harvest. One hypothesis for this is that eels harvested in Canada are older than those harvested in the United States - mean age of silver eels is 14.1 compared to 7.6 years respectively. Hence these decreases are virtually synchronous when age is taken into consideration, reflecting an overall declining abundance of the species (Casselman 2003).<br/><br/><em><strong>Silver eels</strong></em>: <br/>The data sets that were the main focus of analysis and framed further discussions were as follows: Lower St. Lawrence River x2 (QC, Canada), Rivière du Sud-Ouest (QC, Canada).<br/><br/>The three data sets showed varying changes in silver eel abundance over the period of three generations, though all were in decline. The 2012 COSEWIC assessment initiated an official review of the recovery potential of the species in Canada (DFO 2014). The number of mature individuals within the Great Lakes has been estimated from previous spawning escapement data by Verreault and Dumont (2003), who predicted silver eel departures from the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario from a model based on eel passage, commercial landings, percentage of migrating eels in the commercial catch and turbine survival rate. Recent estimates (fisheries independent data including electrofishing CPUE and tailwater surveys at dams) indicate that total spawning escapement has decreased by 65% over the period of 14 years despite a reduction in mortality from commercial fisheries (50% of fishing effort between 2002 and 2009) (G. Verreault, MRNF pers. comm. 2011; COSEWIC 2012). A number of datasets exist for the St. Lawrence River system and as declines were more extreme and occurred earlier upstream, there is value in their use in demonstrating the depth and breadth of the decline and its progression.<em></em>",Decreasing,"The American Eel is a facultatively catadromous anguillid; they are migratory, spending most of their lives in freshwater, estuaries or coastal waters before migrating to the open ocean to spawn – although it is possible that there are elements of the population that exclusively occupy offshore marine habitats. The continental distribution of the American Eel ranges from the coasts and streams of West Greenland in the north (Nielsen and Bertelsen 1992), Labrador (Hamilton Inlet-Lake Melville Estuary), and Newfoundland southward along the Atlantic coast of Canada and the eastern USA to southern Florida along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico to the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula, the Caribbean coast of Central America, the Caribbean and Atlantic coasts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles and other West Indies islands, and occasionally the northern portion of the Atlantic coast of South America (Venezuela and Columbia) (Ogden <em>et al</em>. 1975, Wenner 1978, Erdman 1984, Van Den Avyle 1984, Böhlke and Chaplin 1993, Claro 1994, Kenny 1995, Bussing 1998, Lim <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species is also present in Puerto Rico, Bermuda and the US Virgin Islands. Despite this large range there is strong evidence that this species forms one panmictic population with all mature individuals migrating to the Sargasso Sea area (Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Gagnaire <em>et al</em>. 2012, Côté <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Historically, the American Eel was widely distributed in the continental watersheds associated with this extensive range, including the Mississippi River basin and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin below Niagara Falls. After construction of the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls, eels, which were abundant in Lake Ontario, were frequently reported in the waters of Lake Erie (Trautman 1957). Bensley (1915) reported that eels were occasionally seen at the mouth of the Severn River in southeastern Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, possibly gaining access through the Trent-Severn Waterway. American Eels found on the Canadian side of Lake Superior likely were ballast-water introductions (Mandrak and Crossman 1992). In fact, construction of many large and small dams throughout the eastern half of the North American Continent has caused the range of the American Eel to be greatly reduced (USFWS 2007). Anecdotal evidence indicates that it has disappeared in much of the Mississippi River drainage due to the construction of dams or locks, and no longer reaches many upstream areas in other river systems along the U.S. east coast.<br/><br/>American Eels have been introduced (stocked, released and/or escaped) in several inland areas and several areas in the western United States. Goode (1881) reported that live eels had been privately imported and released into a tributary in the south end of Lake Michigan and dispersed widely in the lake. In 1873, the United States Fisheries Commission released eels in the Calumet and Dead rivers in Illinois and in the Fox River, Wisconsin. They were even introduced into California. In 1878, the Michigan Fish Commission introduced eels from the upper Hudson River, New York, into southern Michigan waters, and in 1882, with wild eel numbers decreasing, the Ohio Fish Commission began the same practice throughout Ohio, stocking from the same source (Trautman 1957). No doubt some of the records of rare eels in Ohio waters of Lake Erie above Niagara Falls around that time came from these stockings. As an experiment, American Eels were introduced into Lac Pelletier (1951), a saline lake in southern Saskatchewan. Some escaped into the South Saskatchewan River (Scott and Crossman 1973). The last record of the species in Saskatchewan was in 1981 (Atton and Merkowsky 1983).","The various life stages, ranging from glass eel to adult, of all <em>Anguilla </em>species are harvested and traded on a global scale for consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes overexploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Crook and Nakamura 2013).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla </em>spp. are traded internationally as live eels for farming and consumption, as fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared eels for consumption and as skins and leather products for fashion accessories. Global trade data collated by FAO for live, fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared <em>Anguilla </em>species (non-species specific) is available for the period 1976–2009. According to FAO data, global annual <em>Anguilla </em>exports averaged around 20,000 tonnes in the late 1970s (valued annually at 55–95 million US Dollars), after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 tonnes in 2000 (valued at over 1,000 million US Dollars). Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 tonnes in 2008 and 2009 (valued at over 800 million US Dollars). By weight, China and Taiwan are responsible for nearly 75% of these exports and Japan for over 75% of all imports (FAO 2013).<br/><br/>Although American Eel has traditionally been consumed in small amounts domestically, in particular in the U.S. and Canada, harvesting is predominantly carried out with the purpose of export. Unlike in Europe or Asia, there is no tradition of farming eels in the Americas. It is well documented that American Eels were very important and widely used for sustenance, reverence, and practical purposes by Aboriginal peoples in prehistoric and historic times (Casselman 2003, MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009, Engler-Palma <em>et al</em>. 2013, Miller and Casselman 2014). Throughout the range, yellow and silver eels have also been fished commercially since European colonisation and more recently all life stages (excluding leptocephali) have been fished. The species was once extremely abundant in watersheds and tributaries in two of the largest reservoirs for the species — Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River system and Mississippi River system — but has gradually declined since the turn of the 20th century, most rapidly from the 1970s to the present (Casselman 2003, MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013, Phelps <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Historically, glass eels and elvers have been commercially fished extensively along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. for striped bass bait to supply farms in Asia (ASMFC 2012).&#160; Since 2001 glass eels are only fished in two states: Maine and South Carolina, with Maine greatly dominant in catch and activity (ASMFC 2012). Small yellow eels are still a popular bait fish for large striped bass fishery.<br/><br/>Global FAO catch data for American Eel is available for the period 1950–2011. In the 1950s and early 1960s, reported annual American Eel catch averaged 900 tonnes. This doubled to ~2,000 tonnes per year in the 1970s, after which there has been a gradual decline back to 1950 catch levels in the 2000s. Throughout this period, catch was split relatively evenly between the U.S. and Canada, with small intermittent annual catches of one to 50 tonnes reported by Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba. In 2011, catches of young yellow eels from Mexico (140 t) and the Dominican Republic (72 t) were the highest ever recorded from these countries (see the <em>Population</em> section above). These catches include all life stages (FAO, 2013).<br/><br/>Historically, commercial harvest of yellow and silver eels in Canada and the U.S. has been approximately equal (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1950 to 2010, U.S. Atlantic coast landings ranged from approximately 300 t in 1962 to 1,665 t in 1979 (ASMFC 2012). After an initial decline in the 1950s, landings increased to a peak in the 1970s and 1980s in response to higher demand from European food markets. In most regions, landings declined sharply in the 1990s and 2000s following a few years of peak landings. The value of U.S. commercial American Eel landings as estimated by NOAA Fisheries has varied from less than $100,000 (prior to the 1980s) to a peak of $6.4 million in 1997. Total landings value increased through the 1980s and 1990s, dropped in the late 1990s, and increased again in the 2000s. The average harvest along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. from 1980 to 2011 was 672 t. In recent years, over half of the harvest of yellow eels has occurred in the State of Maryland (ASMFC 2013). From 2004 to 2010, average annual harvest was 356 t but increased in 2011 to 529 t while harvest in Canada was 337 t and from Mexico and the Dominican Republic a greatly elevated harvest of 212 t. Total overall harvest of the American eel in 2011 was 1,078 t, with approximately 20% coming from the extreme southern part of the range.<br/><br/>American Eels, both live and frozen, have been exported to principal eel consuming markets in Europe and Asia for decades and consumed very little in North America (Miller and Casselman 2014). Between 1997 and 2007 the U.S. and Canada were globally the first and third most important exporters of frozen eel, together exporting 35% of the global total during this period, and on average 2,500 t per year. Over the last 15 years the U.S. and Canada have also been the first and third most important suppliers of live eels to Europe (all life stages), responsible for nearly 50% of all imports of live eels into the EU, averaging at 450 t a year (Crook 2010, Crook 2011).<br/><br/>Eel farming, which is responsible for over 90% of all <em>Anguilla </em>production worldwide (averaging at 280,000 tonnes per year since 2007, (FAO 2013)), is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels or glass eels, as raising eel larvae to the glass eel stage in captivity has only had limited success as yet (Tanaka <em>et al</em>. 2003). The U.S. and Canada have exported <em>A. rostrata</em> glass eels to the principal East Asian eel farming countries/territories in small, irregular quantities for a number of decades. Between 1998 and 2010, live eel fry imports from <em>A. rostrata</em> range states into mainland China and Hong Kong ranged from 0.1 to 10 t per year. However, in 2011 combined imports increased suddenly - from just under 10 t in 2010 to nearly 54 t in 2011 and nearly 28 t in 2012; these high figures have been questioned, however, to date, no other data is available. This sudden change in export quantities coincided with the EU’s decision, at the end of 2010 to ban exports of European Eel, which had previously met a demand borne from a decline in <em>A. japonica</em> glass eel catches.<br/><br/>In 2012, for the first time in over ten years, Japan also imported live eel fry directly from the U.S. (Crook and Nakamura 2013, Crook in litt. 2013) - web-based advertisements in 2013 indicate that the price for <em>A. rostrata</em> glass eels has increased by orders of magnitudes in recent years. Maine and South Carolina are the only two U.S. States that allow commercial fishing of glass eels, however considerable levels of poaching and illegal trade, driven by the ever increasing prices offered for this commodity, have been reported from several States (Anon. 2012). Of the more southerly range of <em>A. rostrata</em>, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti have recently started exporting glass eels to Hong Kong and Korea (according to Asian Customs import data). A U.S.-based Asian-owned company advertises setting up camps along the U.S. coast and in the Caribbean to harvest and export glass eels to Asia (Glass Eel Farm 2012). However, at present only two companies (of 34 companies that applied for permits) are authorized to harvest glass eels in the Dominican Republic and illegal harvesting and trade via Haiti has become an issue of considerable concern to Dominican authorities (Anon. 2013).<br/><br/>In April 2012, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it was considering submitting a CITES listing proposal for <em>A. rostrata </em>(USFWS 2012) due to concerns over the impact increased international trade in this species was having on the population, however no proposal was submitted.<br/><br/><strong>Note</strong>: double-counting, under-reporting and misreporting must be taken into consideration when interpreting all available catch and trade data. See Crook (2010) for explanations of data issues.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"In the late 1990s and early 2000s there were several conservation initiatives in existence relating to fisheries and barriers to migration. However, the primary initiative for conservation concern and action for the American eel was initiated with the 2003 Quebec Declaration of Concern (Dekker <em>et al</em>. 2003) to restore the world’s anguillid eels, produced at the AFS 2003 International Eel Symposium (Casselman and Cairns 2009). But by comparison with the European Eel, integrated management has not been initiated. In December 2010, European Union member states suspended all exports and imports of European Eel commodities, placing further pressure on the American Eel to be used as seedstock for farms.<br/><br/>In Canada, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans manages American Eels in the Maritime provinces, with the powers of management transferred to the province for both Ontario and Quebec. As a result of significant declines in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, the Ontario government established a harvest quota. However, because of the precipitous decline in abundance, commercial quotas were never met, although they were reduced annually. In 2004, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources officially closed all commercial fisheries of eels as a result of the dramatic decline of eels in Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River (Casselman 2003). In 2007 eels in Ontario were officially classified as “Endangered” under the Ontario Endangered Species Act and a Recovery Strategy was prepared to provide advice to government (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Recovery Strategy in Ontario is currently being assessed by the Ontario government and a formal ‘Response Statement’ is being prepared. In Ontario, there is emphasis on restoring, protecting, and diversifying suitable habitat with proposed 10% increases in availability of this habitat every year for five years (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013). A reduction in cumulative mortality (50% at the watershed level by 2050) is also designed to enhance escapement across the species range in Canada in another target set out in the DFO American Eel management plan (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2009). COSEWIC, in 2006, reviewed the status of the American Eel in Canada and recommended “Special Concern” but with the caveat that the species should be reassessed in five years. In May 2012, COSEWIC upgraded the Canadian status to “Threatened”.<br/><br/>In 2008, Aboriginals assembling in Ottawa, Canada, concerned about the decline of eels, prepared an Aboriginal People’s American Eel Resolution, suggesting that eels in Canada be considered “Threatened” and a willingness to give up long-standing rights with eels to see them restored. The resolution expresses concern about the harvest of glass eels and encourages co-operative action and the application of precautionary principles. This early resolution was signed by three large Aboriginal First Nations: the Algonquins of Ontario; the St. Lawrence Iroquois, represented by the Mohawks of Akwesasne; and the Mi'kmaq of the Maritimes. The Algonquins of Ontario have provided documents on the importance of the species and the need to see it returned to its historic range and their ancestral lands to guarantee their association in perpetuity (Algonquins of Ontario 2012).<br/><br/>In the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reviewed the status of the American Eel in 2007 in response to a petition it received in 2004 to list it under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). A 90-day review determined that protection under the ESA may be warranted. After examining all available information about the eel population from Greenland south along the North American coast to Brazil in South America and as far inland as the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage, the Service found declines of eel populations in some areas. After a more extensive review the Service proposed that declines of eel populations in some areas had not put the overall population in danger of extinction. In 2010 the Service received another petition seeking to extend federal protection to the American Eel. The Service found that this petition, from the Council for Endangered Species Act Reliability, presented substantial new information that warranted the initiation of another more extensive status review of the species (FR 2011). This review will be competed in 2015 and will determine whether listing the species under the ESA as Threatened is warranted.<br/><br/>American Eels along the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are managed by the ASMFC . Increasing demand in the 1990s produced what were considered to be unsustainable harvest levels of eels. In 1999, the ASMFC American Eel Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) was put in place to ensure ecological stability and promote sustainable fisheries. This included yearly monitoring of glass eel recruitment followed in 2006 by a mandatory catch and effort monitoring program. Since the late 1990s, American Eel fisheries are managed by the ASMFC in territorial seas and inland waters along the U.S. Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. Increasing demand for eel by Asian markets and domestic bait fisheries, coupled with concern about declining eel abundance and limited assessment data, spurred development of the first Interstate Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for American Eel in the mid-1990s. In 2006 the ASMFC initiated the first stock assessment for American Eels. After extensive peer review the stock assessment was published in 2012. The 2012 benchmark stock assessment found that the American Eel population is depleted in U.S. waters. The stock is at or near historically low levels due to a combination of historical overfishing, habitat loss, food web alterations, predation, turbine mortality, environmental changes, toxins and contaminants, and disease (ASMFC 2012). Through multiple addendums to the American Eel Fishery Management Plan some&#160; small reductions in mortality across some life stages has been achieved, however, the need for, and extent of, additional quotas and/or reductions on the&#160; glass and yellow eels life stages have not been resolved (ASMFC 2013).<br/><br/>Dam removal and installation of eel ladders along the U.S. portion of the range is now a common restoration strategy, however, strategies to protect downstream migration though hydroelectric facilities are rare. Eel passage is currently being addressed on Conowingo Dam and some eel passage has been provided. Fish passage on other large hydro dams is addressed during the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s licensing or relicensing process. Most states are working to improve upstream eel passage on unregulated dams. A recent study shows that dam removal can increase American Eel abundances in the upstream areas (Hitt et al. 2012).<br/><br/>Increasing spawner escapement is critically important in recovery strategies, particularly involving fishing and turbine mortality, which need to be reduced and mitigated (MacGregor <em>et al</em>. 2013), however, governance remains a major problem for the American Eel and integrated management for this panmictic species is lacking. Another possible mitigation measure involves supplementary stocking. Such stocking programs were undertaken from 2005 to 2010 in the St. Lawrence River system, on the Richelieu River, and in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The contribution of these stocked eels to the production of silver eels and subsequently to recruitment in the next generation is unknown; however, there were unexpected effects. For example, a study by Pratt and Threader (2011), of the stocking programme in the upper St.Lawrence River system showed strong evidence that stocked eels survived and grew quickly - female stocked eels started to emigrate within four years after stocking at a small size (compared to wild females), similar to the size reported for migrating wild females in their site of original capture in Nova Scotia. This said, a considerable number of the stocked eels became male in an environment where only females had previously been observed (Pratt and Mathers 2011, Pratt and Threader 2011) and the effects of this shift in sex bias and reduced size are unknown. The authors themselves highlight the limitations of this study in the context of the species' range and more long-term data are required to fully determine the effectiveness of stocking programmes. Restocking programmes, while having been shown to increase escapement in some instances, must be carefully planned and executed in river systems that will benefit from an increase in freshwater population. It is obvious that conservation concerns about the status of the American Eel are now considerable and that international cooperation and coordinated management are needed to protect a species that now has substantially reduced habitat and increasing anthropogenic stressors, with greatly reduced abundance and distribution.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

124403633,39345,Haploblepharus edwardsii,Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2019-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Happy Eddie (<em>Haploblepharus edwardsii</em>) is a small (to 64 cm total length) catshark endemic to South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans, occurring from Langebaan Lagoon, Western Cape, to Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape. This species inhabits rocky reefs, kelp forests, sandy substrates, and the upper continental slope to a depth of 288 m. Little is known of its biology. The Happy Eddie is bycatch in a range of fisheries including beach  seine, gillnet, trawl, recreational and commercial line,  rock lobster, and demersal shark longline. Trend analyses of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas and of angler surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area, estimated population reductions of 88–97% over three generation lengths (60 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. The reduction in research trawls is  partly driven by a steep decline in catches during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was substantially higher. Climate change likely contributed to a range shift away from the research trawl grounds that may account for some of the estimated population reduction but that also likely represents a loss of habitat for the Happy Eddie. Balancing these factors, it is suspected that the Happy Eddie&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.&#160;<br/><em><br/></em>","The Happy Eddie is demersal on rocky reefs, in kelp forests, over sandy substrates, and on the upper continental slope to a depth of 288 m, though mostly at depths of 30–90 m (Human 2007, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). The preferred depth range and habitat of this species varies across its distribution; in the west, it occurs from the intertidal to 30 m in kelp forests and rocky reefs (K. Gledhill, unpubl. data, 2018), whereas in the east, it is found predominantly deeper on sandy habitat (Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975, Human 2007). The Happy Eddie reaches a maximum size of 64 cm total length (TL); males and females mature at 37 cm TL (Human 2007, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is oviparous with egg cases laid in pairs, reproductive periodicity is unknown, and size-at-birth of 9.3 cm TL (Bertolini 1993). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is smaller than the Happy Eddie (48 cm vs 64 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 20 years for the Happy Eddie.","The Happy Eddie is bycatch of a range of fisheries, including beach  seine, gillnet, trawl, recreational and commercial line,  rock lobster, and demersal shark longlines (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). This species has a greater likelihood of capture  in line fisheries compared to some other catsharks because it tends to take large hooks. Fisheries operate throughout its range, but trawl fishery effort in  South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S.  Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Recreational and rock lobster fishers consider the species a nuisance and persecute them as such, likely causing high mortality (Human 2009). When discarded from other fisheries, post-release mortality is likely low, based on generally very low at-vessel and post-release mortality for catsharks  (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Happy Eddie has tended to move southward within South Africa over  three decades from 1981–2016, with a possible concurrent loss of area  occupied (Currie <em>et al</em>. 2019). The range shift is likely at least partially related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al.</em> 2010, Blamey <em>et al. </em>2015). The hatching  rate of egg cases is temperature specific and potentially sensitive to  climate change (M. McCord, unpubl. data, 2018).","<strong></strong>There are no estimates of population size for the Happy Eddie. Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) annual density estimates from South Africa (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), unpubl. data, 2018); and (2) number of  fish per  angler per day from surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA), South Africa (Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), unpubl.  data, 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, the annual density estimates (kg per nm²<sup> </sup>area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016)&#160;in fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 3.4%, consistent with a median reduction of 87.7% over three past generation lengths (60 years), with the highest probability (64.9%) of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. The estimated reduction is driven partly by a steep decline in catch rates during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was substantially higher; over the last two decades the population reduction has been less dramatic. Some of the reduction is possibly a result of a geographic shift in abundance away from the trawl grounds due to climate change (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2019). The southward range shift also likely represents a loss of habitat for the Happy Eddie.<br/><br/>Second, the number of  fish per  angler per day for 1996–2017 (22 years) were available from the De Hoop MPA shore-based research angling surveys conducted by the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA, unpubl. data, 2018). The abundance of the species fluctuated considerably over the 22 years. The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 6.6%,  consistent with a median reduction of 96.5% over three past generation  lengths (60 years), with the highest probability (93.2%) of &gt;80%  reduction over three generation lengths. The De Hoop MPA was established in 1985 and is a no-take reserve, and this may not be representative of the population trends in fished areas of South Africa. <br/><br/>Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over most of its range, combined with a substantial reduction in fishing effort in South Africa and a suspected range shift due to climate change that could account for some of the estimated reduction but also likely represents a decline in area of occupancy, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).",Decreasing,"The Happy Eddie is endemic to South Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans where it occurs from Langebaan Lagoon, Western Cape, to Algoa Bay, Eastern Cape (Human 2007, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). <em><br/></em>",The utilization of the Happy Eddie is unknown.,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this species at present.

In the Mediterranean Sea, there is a high level of exploitation on the continental shelf and upper slope to about 800 m depth (Massuti and Moranta 2003, Ferretti&#160;<em style=""font-family: -webkit-standard;"">et al</em>. 2005, Colloca <em>et al.</em> 2017). This water body has been subject to extensive and intensive fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution with trawl fisheries operating over a wide bathymetric range (50–800 m) and targeting a variety of species (Lleonart and Maynou 2003, Tsikliras&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Semi-industrial fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, off Sicily, Spain and Cyprus are known to take&#160;<em>Mustelus</em>&#160;spp., and also artisanal fisheries elsewhere (Colloca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;<p>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).</p><p><span style="""">In the southeast Atlantic, the Common Smoothhood is also targeted or captured as bycatch. Since 2002, artisanal and recreational fishing pressure in a few parts of southern Angola has increased while other areas remain&#160;unfished (Beckensteiner <em>et al.</em> 2016). The species is also taken by recreational anglers off Namibia (NATMIRC 2003). However, parts of Namibia are remote and may offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). In South Africa, declines in linefish species has led to increased exploitation of demersal sharks, such as&#160;the Common Smoothhound&#160;as both target and bycatch. Fisheries catch data for&#160;this species&#160;in this area is problematic due to misidentification and high levels of under-reporting.&#160;However, this species is one of the top five most valuable commercial species in the demersal shark longline fishery, commercial&#160;</span>line fishery, and inshore trawl fishery (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers part of the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","<span style="""">Species-specific population trend data are available from relative abundance in Mauritania and South Africa (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019; Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches unpubl. data 2020). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (53 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020, Winker&#160;</span><em style="""">et al.</em><span style="""">&#160;2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis of annual standardized abundance index (individual/year) estimates from trawl surveys (1982–2015) in Mauritania revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 92.4% decrease </span>over three generation lengths (53 years), with<span style=""""> the highest probability of&#160; &gt;80% reduction over the past three generation lengths (53 years).&#160;The trend analysis of stock assessment biomass from demersal trawl surveys conducted along the south coast of South Africa&#160;(1990–2016) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.7%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 59% over three generation lengths (53 years), with the highest probability of &gt;50% reduction over the past three generation lengths (53 years).</span><span style=""""><br/><br/></span><span style="""">There are a number of other relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011,&#160;Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013,&#160;Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</span><br/><br/><span style="""">First, in the Mediterranean Sea, surveys indicate that the&#160;C</span>ommon Sm<span style="""">oothhound is more common than the Starry Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus</em><em>&#160;asterias</em>). It&#160;was recorded in 111 of 6,336 hauls (2%) conducted during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS) programme in the western, central, and eastern Mediterranean Sea, from 1994–1999 at depths of 10</span><span style=""""><span style="""">–</span>800 m, and was mostly captured between 0–50 m depth (Baino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).&#160;In similar MEDITS surveys in the western Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula and the&#160;Balearic Islands) from 1994–2017, 207 individuals were recorded in the&#160;Balearic&#160;Islands and another four individuals in the Northern Alboran Sea&#160;(Ramírez-Amaro<em><span style="""">&#160;et al.</span></em><span style="""">&#160;2020). A significant decrease in&#160;abundance of smoothhounds was reported from 1970 onwards in comparable surveys in the Gulf of Lions, southern&#160;France (Aldebert 1997).&#160;MEDITS catch data was also compared from the Adriatic Sea in 1998 with that the Hvar survey in 1948 and indicated that the&#160;occurrence of this species was relatively stable (Jukic-Peladic&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).&#160;</span>In the Hvar trawl surveys, occurrence (frequency log-transformed) was about 1.0 compared to about 0.1 in those of the MEDITS surveys conducted in the same area in 19<span style="""">98.&#160;I</span>n Gruppo Nazionale Risorse Demersali (GRUND) surveys conducted in Italian waters between 1985–1998, the percentage presence was 21.9%. Most of the population was concentrated in the Adriatic Sea and southern waters of Sicily, and the species was absent from the Ligurian Sea and from Sardinian waters (Relini&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000). Reports from trawl fisheries in the Adriatic Sea between 2006–2008 noted the rarity of this species, with a bycatch rate of 0.0256 individuals per haul within this time period (Fortuna <em>et al. </em>2011). The annual bycatch estimate was 863 individuals (95% confidence intervals: 818 to 891 individuals). In MEDITS surveys in the Aegean Sea between 1998–2008, catches of the Common Smoothhound were very low but highly variable (zero to 14 individuals) (Tserpes <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;An experimental trawl fishery in the Aegean Sea (Izmir Bay, Turkey) revealed that this species was one of the least prevalent non-commercial species, representing up to 1.08% of the total catch weight during the winter months, 1.04% in the autumn, 0.42% in the summer months, and 0.43% in the spring (Gurbet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A fishery-independent survey between 2007–2008 in the Gulf of Gabès off Tunisia (North African coast) caught a mean of 2.2 individuals per km&#160;of gillnet per day (Echwikhi&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). The&#160;Common Smoothhound&#160;was more abundant in this study area compared to the other Mediterranean regions (western, central, and eastern) (Echwikhi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Landings data reported to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that landings of <em>Mustelus</em> spp. (grouped as “smoothhounds nei” in landing statistics and probably including the Common Smoothhound, Starry Smoothhound, and Blackspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus punctulatus</em>), of which the Common Smoothhound is the most common in the region) steadily increased between 1950–1978 to 14,000 t, after which they fluctuated between ~6,500 t and 14,000 t from 1978–1994 (FAO 2008). After 1994, landings dropped significantly, decreasing to 2,980 t in 1997 and did not exceed 2,200 t from 2001–2006 (FAO 2008). Although these landings are not species-specific, combined with the results of fishery-independent trawl surveys, they also suggest that this species has declined in abundance in the Mediterranean Sea. In recent decades, a continuous decrease in smoothhounds across the Mediterranean combined with a contraction in their spatial distribution has been reported (Colloca <em>et al.</em> 2017). Specifically, it was estimated that the Common Smoothhound and Blackspotted Smoothhound have declined by 88% in the western Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea since the 1920s (Colloca <em>et al.</em> 2017). On the other hand, trawl surveys of demersal resources in the south of Sicily, where a reduction in fishing effort has occurred since the mid-1990s, indicate that this decline is likely to be less steep in this region with trends in abundance of demersal elasmobranchs in general increasing (Gancitano <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><span style=""""><br/>Second, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch CPUE has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased.&#160;Within countries, catches have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years.&#160;More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).&#160;In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be used to infer reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This steep increase in landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107&#160;t/kW&#160;in 1981–1983 to 0.060&#160;t/kW&#160;in 2013–2015.</span><p></p><p><span style="""">Third, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Common Smoothhound still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, this species is targeted as 'tollo' generally consisting of the Common Smoothhound and the Barbeled Houndshark (<em>Leptocharias smithii</em>) within the&#160;Parc National du Banc D'Arguin with fishers using&#160;specialized gear. While landings have declined, it is still considered a relatively common species (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Between 2004–2011, this species&#160;was recorded during extensive landing site surveys across&#160;the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region in all countries except for Sierra Leone and was considered abundant (Diop&#160;and Dossa 2011, M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). In&#160;The Gambia,&#160;only two individuals of this species were recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010–2018 although other species of sharks were also infrequently recorded&#160;(Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;In&#160;Cape Verde,&#160;</span>reports from a demersal fish resource survey carried out between October and November 2000 (R/V Arquipelago) using demersal longlines at depths down to 1,200 m indicate that this species was frequently caught at depths down to 350 m but more commonly between 0–100 m with abundance values between<span style="""">&#160;0.1%&#160;and 10%&#160;</span>measured as the average percentage of occurrence of each species in all fishing sets per depth strata (Menezes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In Cape Verde, the species<span style="""">&#160;is frequently caught in artisanal fisheries across the archipelago but landings quantities are not available because data are aggregated with other species such as the Atlantic Weasel Shark (<em>Paragaleus&#160;pectoralis</em>), Barbeled Houndshark, and the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>). Across&#160;the archipelago, it is targeted for cação (dried shark meat) which has replaced imported cod from Portugal and has resulted in increased targeted shark fisheries (Seymour&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

It occurs from Portugal to the east coast of South Africa, including Madeira Island, the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Archipelago, and&#160;São Tomé&#160;and&#160;Príncipe&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007,&#160;Ebert and Stehmann 2013, Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Records of this species in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (north of Portuguese waters, that is, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France, and Spain) require confirmation and could be the result of misidentifications with the Starry Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus asterias</em>) (Farrell <em>et al. </em>2009,&#160;McCully Phillips and Ellis 2015).","The Common Smoothhound is commercially valuable across its range where it is utilized fresh, smoked, or dried-salted for human consumption (Bauchot 1987,&#160;Walker<em>&#160;et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><em>&#160;</em>2005, da Silva 2018). In Italian fish markets,&#160;smoothhounds are marketed headless, skinned, and eviscerated and labelled 'palombo'—an umbrella term for a&#160;number of shark species and one of which has been identified through DNA barcoding as the Common Smoothhound (Barbuto <em>et al.</em> 2010).

The European Community Council Regulations 850/98 for the ‘conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms’ details the minimum mesh sizes than can be used to target fish. Smoothhounds would be classed under ‘all other marine organisms’ and so can only be targeted in fixed nets of more than 220 mm (ICES 2012).<br/><br/>The Common Smoothhound is listed in Appendix III of the Barcelona Convention, affording it regulation of any exploitation taking place in the Mediterranean region (Recommendation GFCM/36/2012/1). All vessels encountering this species must record information on fishing activities, catch data, incidental taking, release and/or discarding events in a logbook or similar document, then all logged information must be reported to national authorities.&#160;The Balearic Island Marine Reserves offer minimal protection to smoothhounds, as they<em>&#160;</em>are protected within the waters of the reserve.<br/><br/>In Mauritania, a minimum size limit (60 cm total length) for landings of the Common Smoothhound has been established since 2007 (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). Elsewhere, although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking&#160;the Common Smoothhound are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future.&#160;<br/><p>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Also, a Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>There are a number of protected areas in South Africa across the range of this species that may offer some protection. Additionally, gill net fisheries are prohibited from retaining sharks and rays while beach seine fisheries are only allowed to retain sharks in False Bay (da Silva 2018).&#160;There is currently a bag limit of 1 per person per day among non-commercial anglers, with no bag limits for commercial fisheries (Cliff and da Silva 2020).&#160;A size limit of 70<span style="""">–</span>130 cm is currently being implemented for this species in the demersal longline and the commercial linefishery.&#160;This will protect the juveniles and the larger, more fecund adult females&#160;(Cliff and da Silva 2020). &#160;</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It has been recorded on continental and insular shelves and slopes&#160;at depths of 50–1,400 m, and mostly between 400–800 m. The species is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years).&#160;Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, and the species&#160;is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range.&#160;Globally, the Little Gulper Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generations (180 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<strong><br/></strong>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The <a>Little Gulper Shark&#160;</a><span lang=""EN-GB"">is demersal on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of 50–1,400 m, and mostly between 400–800 m (Weigmann 2016, C.

It reaches a maximum size of 128 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~80 cm TL and females mature at ~96 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, fecundity is very low, with a single pup per litter, and size-at-birth estimated at 35–45 cm TL (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Generation length of this species is estimated at 60 years (B. Moe, pers. comm., 21/11/2019), but should be used with caution as further validation is required.&#160;</span></p>","<p>The Little Gulper Shark is taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in mid-water and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries. <br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). <br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and between 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019).&#160;Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, this species was previously reported in small quantities in Portuguese longline fisheries (ICES-WGEF 2018). It is reported in bottom longlines and trammel nets throughout the Mediterranean (Guallart 1998,&#160;<a class=""linked-name"" style=""font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"">Massutí and Moranta 2003,&#160;</a>Lteif<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017).

Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The species likely has some refuge from fishing in the US Gulf of Mexico, where Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010). The species, however, is still susceptible to longline fisheries (Driggers <em>et al. </em>2017). Elsewhere in the Gulf, there are a number of deep-water fisheries where&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp have been reported (Benavides&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There are a number of deep-water fisheries from Venezuela, fishing at depths of 200–800 m; demersal chondrichthyans are not targeted but are encountered as bycatch (O. Lasso-Alcalá unpubl. data 2019). There is increasing interest in developing deep-water fisheries in the Caribbean (e.g.&#160;Paramo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) and the development of any fishery should be monitored as this species may be susceptible to being caught as bycatch.<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</p>","<p>Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of gulper sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nomimal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Gulf of Mexico (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019) (2)&#160;standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the&#160;Southwest Pacific (Walker and Gason 2007). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths (180 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, in the Gulf of Mexico, nominal CPUE between 2011–2018 (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019) showed&#160;an annual rate of increase of 10.7%, consistent with an estimated increase of&#160;120.4% over three generation lengths (180 years), with the highest probability (99%) of&#160;no major reductions in population over three generation lengths. <br/><br/>Second, the trend analysis using standardized CPUE between 1996–2006 off Southwest Australia showed&#160;an annual rate of decline of 11%, consistent with an estimated decrease of&#160;100% over three generation lengths (180 years), with the highest probability (88%) of &gt;80% reductions in population over three generation lengths. In addition, significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch of gulper sharks&#160;(mainly&#160;<em>C. harrissoni</em>,&#160;<em>C. uyato</em>, and&#160;<em>C. moluccensis</em>) from 1976–77 to 1996–97 on the upper slope trawl fishery off New South Wales (NSW), Australia, have been documented by fishery-independent surveys (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). This accounts for only a small proportion (&lt;10%) of the species known range. <br/><br/>Nearly all landings of gulper sharks other than the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) from the Northeast Atlantic have been reported from the Portuguese longline fishery (ICES-WGEF 2018). Annual landings were ~100 t until 2008, and rapidly declined to 2 t in 2009, likely in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018). In the Mediterranean, there are uncertainties with species identification in this region, but the species is considered generally rare (Bradai<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012), but may be locally abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea (Guallart 1998).<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including gulper sharks, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations.&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007). The total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). Despite documented declines in marine resources, fishing effort is on the rise. In Ghana and Senegal, for example, artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010; industrial effort decreased since the 1990s, with total fishing CPUE declining by a third since 1950 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The gulper shark stock off India is suspected to have similarly collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing off western India. Gulper shark&#160;landings declined from 114 t in 2008 to 39 t in 2011 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl.&#160;data 2019), equating to a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generations (180 years).&#160;Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of gulper sharks&#160;declined from 18% to 1–14% between 1984–2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). In Sri Lanka, the targeted gulper shark fishery at Valaichchenai, which dates back to the 1980s, has seen a large reduction in effort, from 30 to 2 vessels, in recent years (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019). The rationale for this reduction in fleet is claimed to be self-regulation of the fishery, although lack of long-term economic and biological viability of the fishery is also suspected.<br/><br/>The Little Gulper Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range and estimated to be increasing in the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Little Gulper Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Mediterranean&#160;Sea, Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;</p>","<p></p><p>Gulper shark liver oil, rich in squalene, is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). Oil may be processed locally or shipped overseas (e.g. Dubai) for processing before sold on the international market. High grade oil is exported to Japan and the European Union (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019, K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). Flesh is sold to local markets (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), while waste products from liver oil production is utilized as aquaculture and poultry feed (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). Gulper shark fins are of low value (Jaiteh&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016), but have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018).</p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Leafscale Gulper Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.&#160;Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.<br/><br/>Management action implemented for the conservation and long-term sustainability of deep-water sharks in the Northeast Atlantic may indirectly offer the species some refuge. These actions include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by EU vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005.<br/><br/>In Australia, this species has the most detailed recovery plan for any deep-water shark in the world. Gulper sharks are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp). Both the Little Gulper Shark and Harrisson’s Dogfish (<em>C. harrissoni</em>) are listed as Conservation-Dependent under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). Species are subject to recovery plans that specify management actions to halt fishing mortality, including combined trigger limits of these two species, a zero retention limit, and guidelines for handling practices (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Gulper shark protection areas (closed to all methods of fishing) were carefully implemented based on species' demographic data (Daley <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;Individual based simulation modelling of tracking data and life history predicted stock off southern Australia can recover from a precautionary estimate of 8% of initial numbers to 20%; however, this was estimated to take 64 years due to the low reproductive capacity of this species (Daley <em>et al.</em> 2019). In some areas, the species is still caught incidentally, and without fisheries closures, the stock is estimated to collapse in&#160;&lt;30 years (Daley <em>et al. </em>2019). A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), may offer refuge in this region.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It reaches a maximum size of 108 cm total length, males mature at 81 cm TL, and females mature at 97 cm TL (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2 pups and size-at-birth of 31 cm TL (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproductive periodicity is unknown but could be 2–3 years based on other <em>Centrophorus </em>species (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely-related and similar-sized species, the Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus granulosus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 16.5 years and a maximum age of 39 years, resulting in a generation length of 27.8 years (Guallart 1998).","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is targeted and taken as bycatch by deep-water gear, including demersal trawl, longline, and hook-and-line, and retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and fish meal.   <br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s, coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high and was 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">016).</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><br/>The Blackfin Gulper Shark is a bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off the northeast and southwest coasts of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The fishery on the east coast, particularly  operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper waters over the past 30 years (from 1998–2019) due to  depletion of shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing  depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D.  Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Prior to 30 years ago (about one generation length) this species would not have been fished in Taiwan as it was beyond the depth of the fishing gear. During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water  trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 28 August 2019); this would provide a reprieve from fishing pressure for the Blackfin Gulper Shark. Deep-water longlines in Taiwan operate at depths of  100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28 August 2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species as its upper depth limit is beyond the reach of the longline gear. <br/><br/>In China, this species has only been reported to date from a research survey. Most commercial fisheries in China operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is taken on deep-water demersal longlines that operate at depths of 150–600 m (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish are targeted for their liver oil using bottom set multiple hook-and-line gear and likely include captures of the Blackfin Gulper Shark (Flores 2004, Gaudiano and Alava 2003).","The Blackfin Gulper Shark is considered a rare species in some areas (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). The species was first described from China based on one specimen (Chu <em>et al.</em> 1981). In Taiwan, it is seen occasionally at landing sites, and in the Philippines, it is known from at least five specimens  (Compagno <em>et al. </em>2005, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). In Indonesia, at least 58 individuals have been reported (White and Dharmadi 2010).<br/><br/>There is no species-specific data from Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort.  <p>The landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 62% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (83 years) for the Blackfin Gulper Shark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/>  </p>There is no population decline information for the Philippines or Indonesia. <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. populations are reported to have collapsed when fished intensively for as little as two decades, as seen in the Maldives and Australia (Graham <em>et al.</em> 2001, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2017).

There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the entire species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all elasmobranchs and whiprays across the region can be used to infer declines of 50–99% over the past three generation lengths (45 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is  informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids  in the region.

It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).&#160;By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).</p><p>There is intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>  </p><p>In the Philippines, the fishing fleet rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). </p>  <p>This species is caught in the markets in Singapore and make up ~2% of  the rays landed there&#160;(N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). This species is commonly landed, particularly during the monsoon season (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>  </p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p>  <p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t(per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg / hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20–25 days (NARA 2003).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, the majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (two generation lengths). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently began (2 years) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses bottom set gillnets to catch up to 6 tonnes of rays per trip (3–5 days). There are currently 20–40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).</span></p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995).<br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>There is no population trend estimate for this species.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">D</a>espite the lack of species-specific data, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the China Exclusive <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. This represents a reduction of 54% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray (45 years). Fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>In Taiwan, landings data&#160;are available on the combined catch of all ray species taken by bottom trawl in Da-xi, Yilan County. The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993–2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993–2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019). </p>  <p><strong></strong></p><p>  </p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This infers a decline as fishing effort increased during the period and represents a reduction of 99% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray (45 years). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates fshowed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly et al. 2020). This represents a reduction of 99% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray (45 years).</p>  <p></p>    <p>Reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. Butterfly rays have similar ecological traits as whiprays and are likely to be caught in the same gears, thus this is an appropriate taxonomic group to help determine population trends. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years (a time-span of one generation length) despite increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, representing a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray (45 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 79–96% in this butterfly ray.</p>    <p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and southern Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 tper year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;et al.&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Zonetail Butterfly Ray in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (45 years).</p>  <p>  </p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (Krajangdara 2019). </p>  <p>  </p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al. </em>2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. </p>  <p>In Sri Lanka, approximately 75% of individuals landed of this species were mature (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Overall, reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al. </em>2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “<em>it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion</em>” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).The Zonetail Butterfly Ray population is suspected to have declined off India due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg per hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg perhr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).&#160;This is an ~95%&#160;decline over a period of three generation spans (45 years) for the Zonetail Butterfly Ray.&#160;Although this information is not species-specific,&#160;this provides an indication of overall ray declines as a result of heavy (and increasing) fishing pressure on the continental shelf in India. Ongoing fishing is suspected to result in continuing population declines in the future.&#160;</p><p>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray. It is less productive and occurs in more shallow waters than its sympatric congener the Longtail Butterfly Ray (<em>G. poecilura</em>). Overall, it is suspected that the Zonetail Butterfly Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (45 years) and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Zonetail Butterfly Ray occurs in the Eastern Indian, and Western and Northwest Pacific Oceans ranging from eastern India and Sri Lanka&#160;to Taiwan and the Philippines (Last <em>et al. </em>2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","<p>The meat of the Zonetail Butterfly Ray is consumed fresh or dried and salted. It is valuable in Indonesia (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020) but sold at lower costs than other rays in Malaysia (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). It comprises a majority of the ray catch in the Karimata Strait (R. Yuneni unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, this species is used for its meat and as bait for longlines (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). In India, the meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. There is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). In India, ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price.</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In China, in response to the fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante<em> et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019).<a name=""_Hlk21689683""> In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689697""></a>There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>In Viet Nam There is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.</em>&#160;2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). These bans and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010 (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.</em>&#160;2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al.</em>2018).</p><p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong<em> et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;Throughout Indonesia there are 196 marine protected areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004,two shark reserves were established  in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020). India has a seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. The Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). <br/></p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
124440562,169243577,Aetobatus flagellum,Endangered,A2d,2021,2020-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Longhead Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus&#160;flagellum</em>) is a medium-sized (to 90 cm disc width) ray that occurs throughout the Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from the Arabian/Persian Gulf to Myanmar and in the waters surrounding Borneo down to the Java Sea. It is benthopelagic in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 40 m. This species likely has limited biological productivity with an inferred generation length of 7 years. The meat is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins from large rays are exported from Bangladesh to Myanmar to be made into accessories. Across the entire species’ entire range, there is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising. There are no species-specific population time-series, although  reconstructed landings data of all whiprays, which are caught in the same gears as this species, from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 52–91% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Its coastal habitat has been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in large declines. It is suspected that the Longhead Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>","The Longhead Eagle Ray is benthopelagic on the inner continental shelf at depths of 0–40 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 90 cm disc width (DW), males are mature by 50 cm DW, and females are mature by 75 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with<strong> </strong>probably a small litter size<strong> </strong>and size-at-birth is ~23 cm DW (White and Moore 2013, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Little else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from eagle rays with age data, the Bat Eagle Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) and the Naru Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus narutobiei</em>) that have estimated generation lengths of 14.5 and 12 years, respectively (Martin and Cailliet 1988, Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Bat Eagle Ray and Spotted Eagle Ray are larger than the Japanese Eagle Ray (~180 cm and ~160 cm DW vs 90 cm DW) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 7 years for the Longhead Eagle Ray.  <p><br/></p><p><br/>  </p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Longhead Eagle Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seines (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. This species is threatened by being caught in inshore&#160;gillnets across its range while aggregating. In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).</p><p>Trawling is particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 28/07/2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive longline and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh<em>&#160;et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</span></p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m, but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg/hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, <strong>Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985)</strong>. Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20–25 days (NARA 2003).<span class=""tlid-translation""></span></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (more than three generation lengths). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;<br/></span></p><p>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported  catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull  2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas, IUU catch of sharks was  estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher  levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2010).</p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em><em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">&#160;</em>2010).&#160;Marine habitats in the Arabian/Persian Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, and habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010) which is likely to impact this species.","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species.&#160;Despite the lack of species-specific trend data,  reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. While not a whipray, the Longhead Eagle Ray is a similar size and susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of eagle rays. There are two lines of evidence throughout this species' distribution in Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 tonnes. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 tonnes, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 tonnes per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 tonnes in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 tonnes per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 tonnes per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 tonnes per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 tonnes, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (21 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 52–77%.</p><p>There are three lines of evidence throughout its distribution in Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, two catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia and central Indonesia, and&#160; research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 tonnes and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 tonnes in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch then decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (almost three generation lengths) (Blaber <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Longhead Eagle Rays in Indonesia is 54–91% over the past three generation lengths (21 years).</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.&#160;Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al. </em>2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires (n=200) completed by local fishers have indicated a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque, unpubl. data, 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2-5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 1995 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “<em>it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion</em>” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005). This species was previously caught in the waters surrounding Sri Lanka in the early 2010s and is now considered extremely rare (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>In the Arabian Seas region, the species is reported as fairly common in the northern Gulf, but occurrences are patchy&#160;(Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). In a survey of elasmobranchs in Kuwait, this species represented 4% (in 2009) and 8.3 % (in 2011) of ray landings by number (Moore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The species was not recorded from landing surveys in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (Moore and Peirce 2013, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 06/02/2017).&#160;Vossoughi &amp; Vosoughi (1999) recorded four individuals (~1% of 366 ray specimens) from off the Hormuz coast of Iran.&#160;The species&#160;is very rare in Pakistan and India (M. Khan and K. K. Bineesh pers. comm. 06/02/2017). Only one specimen was recorded from a survey of landing sites in Gujarat in 2013–2014 (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 09/02/2017). The population is suspected to have declined off Iran, Pakistan and India due to increased fishing pressure. In India and Pakistan, there is an overall decline in rays from intense fishing.&#160;For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a similar (63%) decline in landings of the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>), which is equivalent to a ~78% decline over a period of three generation lengths (45 years) of the Longhead Eagle Ray.&#160; It is suspected that similar pressure is ongoing in Gujarat (India) and Pakistan where trawler numbers are high (see Threats section). Pressure is lower in some other parts of its range (parts of the Gulf, Oman), but this species is apparently rare with similar catchability in a wide range of fishing gear to more numerous species such as the closely-related Banded Eagle Ray (<em>A. nichofii</em>).&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across most of the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Longhead Eagle Ray. Overall, it is inferred that the Longhead Eagle Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (21years) and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>",Decreasing,"The Longhead Eagle Ray has a patchy distribution in the Eastern and Western Indian Oceans and Western Central Pacific from the Arabian/Persian Gulf to Myanmar and in the waters surrounding Borneo down to the Java Sea (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","<p>The meat of the Longhead Eagle Ray is consumed locally in Indonesia and Malaysia (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is possibly landed at the markets in Singapore (there while&#160;<em>Aetobatus</em> species are landed but not identified to species level) and sold to local grocery stores (N. Clark-Shen unpubl. data 2020). They are occasionally landed throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range and the meat is consumed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. In Bangladesh, the skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand of ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and some anecdotal information suggests in restaurants as well (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In the Gulf of Oman this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption.&#160;In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan pers. comm. 12/02/2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh&#160;unpubl. data 2017). The skin of large rays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 15/02/2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.<br/></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place.&#160;In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) with a total area of 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs with a total area of 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).&#160;</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 18/02/2020). The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with  regulations specifically banning catches of rays. The UAE, Qatar, and  Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993, and 2011,  respectively). However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries  (e.g. gillnetting). </p><p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
124440727,60120,Aetomylaeus maculatus,Endangered,A2d,2020,2020-04-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em></em>The Mottled Eagle Ray (<em>Aetomylaeus maculatus</em>) is a medium-sized (to 100 cm disc width) ray that occurs from China to India in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. It is pelagic in inshore waters over soft, sandy habitats to depths of 60 m. The species is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal trawl and net fisheries and is retained for human consumption or fish meal. It is suspected to have limiting life history parameters similar to other myliobatid rays (including low fecundity), that limit its capacity to sustain fishing pressure. There are no species-specific time series, although  catch-per-unit effort of all rays has remained stable in the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) over 17  years. Elsewhere, all rays combined from the Thailand EEZ, reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar EEZs, and landings of eagle rays in India indicate declines of 40–99% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). Further, this species no longer occurs in the Gulf of Thailand where eagle rays were historically common. Historic and current fishing pressure are high across the species’ entire range, and it is considered rare in Taiwan and Viet Nam and uncommon in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The species has no refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Mottled Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction  of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Mottled Eagle Ray is pelagic, mostly over soft, sandy habitats, from inshore to depths of 60 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 54–72 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with size-at-birth of 29 cm DW but nothing else is known of its biology (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Low fecundity is suspected as with other myliobatids, for example the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus narinari</em>) and the Banded Eagle Ray (<em>Aetomylaeus nichofii</em>), which bear litters of up to four pups (Last and Stevens 2009, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only eagle ray with age data, the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 5 years and a maximum age of 24 years, resulting in a generation length of 14.5 years (Martin and Cailliet 1988). The Bat Ray is larger than the Mottled Eagle Ray (~150 cm vs 100 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 10 years for the Mottled Eagle Ray.","<p>The Mottled Eagle Ray is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is retained for human consumption, fish meal, and the skin. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Mottled Eagle Ray.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon e<em>t al.</em> 2012). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered  overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ,  and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued  to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo  and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s  Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215  vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly  decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao<em> et al.</em>  2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).  The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for  non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for  fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is taken in inshore fisheries that operate at depths of 30–60 m and use trawl, demersal longline and demersal gillnet (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014a, FAO 2020a). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014a, FAO 2020a). Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).  The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially  from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the  increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries  (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore  and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorized vessels increased  during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for  one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). In Malaysia, this species is rarely landed with capture likely reduced  since the ban on large mesh size gillnets in 1990 (A. Bin Ali unpubl.  data 2020). Across Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the  mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited  by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all  sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150  vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has  been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold  (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). There has been, and still is, a currently  rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this  comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is captured occasionally by gillnet and retained (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili<em> et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with batoid contribution to rising catches. Batoids comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings in 2003, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. International Labour Organization (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The demand for seafood is very high in Myanmar, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 48–52 kg per capita in 2013–2016 (FAO 2020b, Helgil 2020b). In Bangladesh, anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over  the past 10 years (A. Haque, unpub. data 2020). The artisanal fishing  vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate  inshore at depths of 0–40 m (A. Haque, unpub. data 2020). In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation. This species is  taken in gillnets and sometimes in longlines and retained. There are  about 13,000 trawlers and more than 10,000 gillnetters operating on the  east coast (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction  and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (Heileman 2009,  MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). </p><p></p><p></p>","The Mottled Eagle Ray is considered rare in Taiwan and Viet Nam, uncommon in China and Indonesia, and is infrequently landed in Borneo (Malaysia) (Last<em> et al. </em>2010, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, H. Ho and J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020, V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). The species no longer occurs in the Gulf of Thailand where eagle rays were historically common (White 2006).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Landings data are also available on all combined ray species from the  Thailand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019).  The landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018.  Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003  followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara  2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in  catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. However, this species no longer occurs in the Gulf of Thailand where eagle rays were historically common (White 2006). <br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar  EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings in  China (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The  decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around  30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings  over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in  1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose  steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed  by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).  These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to  represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has  increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the  period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings of sharks and rays can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Malaysia EEZ, reconstructed landings showed declines of  30–54% from 1979 to 2014. In most regions catches rose to a peak in the  late 1990s and subsequently declined (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).  Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s in all regions and  thus these declines infer reductions in the populations. In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied  between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no substantial trend. From  the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to around 40,000 t per year  which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020).  This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and  ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased.  However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark  and ray populations. <br/><br/>In Indonesia,  research survey data from 1976 to 1997 shows an ~ 50% decline in ray catch-per-unit  effort 1976–1997 throughout the Java Sea across the Mottled Eagle Ray's  range (Blaber<em> et al. </em>2009). In India, there is an overall decline in batoids from intense fishing  (Raje and Zacharia 2009). For example, the annual average catch of rays  landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502  t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the  catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004  (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a similar (63%) decline  in landings of the Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>). The Spotted Eagle ray catches on the west coast of India from 2009 to 2019 have since fluctuated but not declined (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In the same area, catches of the Ornate Eagle ray (<em>Aetomylaeus vespertilio</em>) have significantly declined from 1.1–1.6 t annually for 2009–2012 to zero catches annually from 2012 to 2019 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Mottled Eagle Ray (30 years), they represent declines of 40%, 98%, 99%, 58%, 63% and 88% in China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, respectively. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of the Mottled Eagle Ray. The species has no refuge from fishing pressure and is considered rare in Taiwan and Viet Nam and uncommon in China, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Overall, across its range, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). <br/><span><span></span>",Decreasing,"The Mottled Eagle Ray is widespread from China to India in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Haque <em>et al.</em> 2019).","The meat is used for human consumption. In Taiwan, the dried meat is of high value at ~USD$35/kg whereas the fresh meat is not as valuable (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In China, the small dorsal fin is consumed and the rest of the animal used for fish meal  (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). In Borneo (Malaysia), the meat is used but is of limited value (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). The meat is highly valued in Viet Nam (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, the meat of eagle rays is preferred and more valuable than that of other rays (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Bangladesh, large rays are desirable for the meat and skin; the meat is consumed locally and exported and the skin is exported to Myanmar (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In India, the meat is valuable and skin of eagle rays is often processed and used for leather (K.K Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).  The species is used for aquarium displays.",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012). <br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which  cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas,  with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and  4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, large mesh gillnets (&gt;24.5 cm) were banned in 1990 (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini-trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was put in place and set to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future (Dharmadi, unpublished data). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020).       In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher,&#160;pers. comm. 02/04/2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
124442197,60129,Rhinoptera javanica,Endangered,A2cd,2021,2020-05-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Javanese Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera javanica</em>) is a large (to 165 cm disc width) ray found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans from Oman to the Philippines and north to Japan. It is benthopelagic in inshore waters from the surface to depths of 50 m. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with a wide range of gears and is retained for the meat which is consumed locally and traded internationally and in some countries used for fish meal production. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all elasmobranchs, rays and whiprays from across its range infer declines of 56–99% over the past three generation lengths (44 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure and its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture.&#160;The Javanese Cownose Ray has undergone a suspected population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Javanese Cownose Ray is benthopelagic in tropical waters from the surface to depths of 50 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 165 cm disc width (DW), males and females mature at 128 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–2 pups and a size-at-birth of 30 cm DW (W.T. White unpubl. data 2020). The species is&#160; known to form large aggregations (James 1962) which may make them susceptible to capture. As there is no information on this species' ge-at-maturity and maximum age, a generation length of 14.5 years was inferred based on age data for the Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>), which attains a similar size (180 cm DW) (Martin and Cailliet 1988).","The Javanese Cownose Ray in taken as target and bycatch in coastal industrial and artisanal fisheries fisheries throughout its range by a range of gears including demersal trawl, purse seines, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2009). It is retained for human consumption or for fish meal. The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>The Javanese Cownose Ray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh et al. 2014, FAO 2020a). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s (Teh et al. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~78,000 vessels) but also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly et al. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Javanese Cownose Ray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries and all incidental catch appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s and by the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines (Palomares et al. 2014). The commercial fleet tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Malaysia, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the CPUE which declined from &gt;300 kg/hr in 1963 to 20–30 kg/hr in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, Rhinoptera spp. are caught in large abundances in purse seines, up to 10,000 kg/year (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher; foreign vessels were banned in 2014. Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, coastal fisheries account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts operate and of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines (Wijayaratne 2001, NARA 2003). In India, Rhinoptera spp. have been caught regularly in the mixed species fishery by a large suite of gears. Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported Rhinoptera spp. formed 8% of rays landed at Chennai, Bay of Bengal during the 2002–2006 period, in which trawls were the major gear used and the annual catch ranged between 33–120 t. Juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the species' range (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over two generation lengths) (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently began (two years ago) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses demersal set gillnets to catch up to 6 t of rays/ trip (3–5 days). There are currently 20–40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Pakistan, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf areas, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab et al. 2006). Four individuals were recorded during a trawl survey conducted in the Iranian Sea of Oman in 2014 (Rastgoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the United Arab Emirates, this species comprised &lt;0.05% of examined batoid landings and only adult females were observed (R.W. Jababo unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegali, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species’ preference for coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro et al. 2010).&#160; In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995). Marine habitats in the Arabian Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010).","The ranges of this species and the Oman Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera jayakari</em>) overlap, and identification is problematic with species-specific information typically not available. Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the Chinese and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase. In Viet Nam, the reconstructed catch data showed an 97% decline from 1986–2014. Catches peaked at 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in the populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Javanese Cownose Ray (44 years) they represent declines of 56% and 99% in China and Viet Nam, respectively.<br/><br/>In Taiwan and Thailand, landings data are available on the combined catch of all skate and ray species, respectively, and in the Philippines reconstructed catch data is available for all ray species. In Taiwan, landings data indicate an 80% decrease over 49 years from 1953–2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, and these declines can be inferred to represent reductions in the skate populations. In Thailand, landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003–2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2,000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003–2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data showed a 76% decline in 16 years from 1991–2006. Catches peaked at 10,990 t in 1991 and then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This infers a population reduction as fishing effort increased during this period. When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Javanese Cownose Ray (44 years) they represent declines of 77% and 99% in Taiwan and the Philippines, respectively.<br/><br/>Landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. While not a species of whipray, the Javanese Cownose Ray is caught in similar gears, thus the trends in whiprays is suspected to be similar to that of this species. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65% (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Pauly et al. 2020). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Javanese Cownose Ray (44 years), this represents declines of 77–99%.<br/><br/>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and southern Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Pauly et al. 2020). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Pauly et al. 2020). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber et al. 2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Javanese Cownose Rays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (44 years).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950, there are significant concerns for the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In India, fishing effort is on the rise (Dineshbabu 2013). Historically, this species appear to be abundant, for e.g., James (1962), reported a landing of large number rays (&gt;1,000) within two weeks. In the south east coasts of India and adjoining waters of Sri Lanka this species was seen in large aggregations before the mechanisation of vessels. The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled consequently in 1990 and the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 94% decline over three generation lengths (44 years). Although this information is not species-specific, and the proportion of cownose rays in the catch in unknown, it provides a good indication of ray declines in India. A general reduction in elasmobranch CPUE has been reported from India (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which could be applicable to this species. In Pakistan, while specific data are lacking, dramatic declines have occurred in cownose ray landings since 1999 (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in elasmobranch, rays, and whiprays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Javanese Cownose Ray. These declines ranged from 56–99% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) of the Javanese Cownose Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Javanese Cownose Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (44 years).",Decreasing,The Javanese Cownose Ray is found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans ranging from Oman to the Philippines and north to Japan (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).,"The flesh of the Javanese Cownose Ray is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption and is consumed locally or exported dried (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In the Gulf of Oman this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia or used as raw material for fish meal production (M. Khan unpubl. data 2020). In India, elasmobranchs are consumed historically and in the southern state of Kerala, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of whiprays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.",Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon et al.2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao et al. 2019). There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020b). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer et al. 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray et al. 2018).<br/><br/>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region, however, are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, the government established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard et al. 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020). The United Arab Emirates and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, there are no trawl fisheries in Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in shallow coastal and continental shelf waters at depths of 20–100 m. The species has limited biological productivity with small litter sizes of 2–9 pups and an estimated generation length of 10 years. The species is captured in industrial, artisanal, and  subsistence fisheries with  multiple gears, including trawl,  gillnet, and longline, and is retained  for the meat and fins. The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including guitarfishes)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human  consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark  fin trade. However, the fins of this species are likely of lower value due to their small size and while they are known to be consumed domestically in Taiwan and China, they are not currently reported in international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Ringed Guitarfish. Landings data of all skates combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 40–90% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.  Severe reductions of guitarfishes have  occurred elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific due to fishing pressure. The Ringed Guitarfish is subject to intense fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range and there is serious concern for its ability to sustain historic and current levels of fishing pressure.<strong> </strong>Although the observed landings of Ringed Guitarfish are considered stable over the  past 17 years in&#160;Taiwan, this represents a relatively minor  part of its range, and there is no concurrent effort data from the observed area to infer population trends. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in  China and Taiwan respectively, may afford the species some refuge from  fishing pressure. Dramatic levels of habitat loss across its China and South Korea range are also likely a threat to the species. It is inferred that the Ringed Guitarfish has  undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths  (30 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Ringed Guitarfish is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 20–100 m (Weigmann 2016, Shao 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm total length (TL); males mature at 38 cm TL and females mature at 39 cm TL (Zhu and Meng 2001, Wenbin and  Shuyuan  1993). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 2–9, a gestation period of 12 months and a size-at-birth of 16 cm TL (Wenbin and  Shuyuan  1993). Age parameters are unknown but based on estimated generation lengths of other rhinopristoid rays, generation length is estimated at 10 years (Kyne and Ebert 2019, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.</p>","<p>The Ringed Guitarfish is subject to heavy fishing pressure on its coastal and shelf habitats across its entire range. It is captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with  multiple fishing gears, including trawl, gillnet, longline, hook and line, trap,  and seine net, and is retained for the meat and fins. Across the broader Indo-Pacific region, guitarfish species are often targeted and are heavily exploited and increasing fishing effort has put significant  pressure on all guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The high  value of fins is driving retention and trade of guitarfishes globally  (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Ringed Guitarfish. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to the fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019).<br/><br/>Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat to adults and to juveniles that likely use inshore habitats as nursery areas. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).</p>","<p>The Ringed Guitarfish is not an abundant species in Taiwan but there has been little change observed in the abundance at landing sites over the past 17 years (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019); although there is no concurrent effort data from the area observed to infer population trends. In China, it is regularly observed at landing sites but mostly smaller individuals are noted and there is no information on changes in abundance over time (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined skate species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings decreased by 80% over 49 years from 1953 to 2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of skates can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65-year period (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) of the Ringed Guitarfish, they represent declines of 63%, 88%, 40%, and 90% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region.<br/><br/>Additionally, elsewhere where rhinopristoid rays (sawfishes [Pristidae], wedgefishes [Rhinidae], giant guitarfishes [Glaucostegidae], and guitarfishes [Rhinobatidae]) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g., Tous&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1998, Dulvy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Historical accounts and contemporary datasets show: (1) a 93% decline in 'Rhinobathidae' (which probably equals  guitarfishes generally) catch rate in the Gulf of Thailand from peak  catches in 1968 to 1972 (Ritragsa 1976, Pauly 1979, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019); (2) the collapse of  Indonesian targeted wedgefish fisheries (Chen 1996, Suzuki 2002, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019); (3)  the depletion of rays (which can be used to infer declines in  guitarfishes) in the Java Sea (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) (recent trawl surveys in the Java Sea and North Natuna Sea recorded only three&#160;<em>Rhynchobatus</em>; Tirtadanu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Yusup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018);  (4) declines in landings from Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which are  the equivalent of 81–99% population reduction over the last three  generation lengths (30 years) (DGCF 2015, 2017, FAO 2018, Kyne and Ebert 2019, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019); and, (5) significant  declines in landings of 'guitarfishes' in  Tamil Nadu (86% decline for a 5-year period) and catch rates of rays  (which is representative of declines  in demersal batoids) in Maharashtra, India (63% decline for a 15-year period) (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Raje and Zacharia 2009, Kyne and Ebert 2019, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Inferred population declines of the Ringed Guitarfish over three generation lengths (30 years) based on all elasmobranchs range from 40–90%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Ringed Guitarfish, with no areas of refuge from fishing pressure. Severe reductions of guitarfishes have occurred elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific due to fishing pressure and while the datasets presented in the preceding paragraph are outside the range of the Ringed Guitarfish, they can be considered representative&#160;of population reduction throughout the Indo-West Pacific. The landings of Ringed Guitarfish have been stable over the past 17 years in&#160;Taiwan, although that represents a relatively minor part of its range and there is no concurrent effort data to infer trends. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Ringed Guitarfish is endemic to the Northwest Pacific where it is found from Japan to Viet Nam, including South Korea, China, and Taiwan (Last <em>et al. </em>2016).","<p>This species is used for the meat, fins, cartilage, and skin. In Taiwan, the meat is of relatively low value at US$2/kg and considered lower quality than the meat of wedgefish. Individuals too small for human consumption are used for fish meal in Taiwan, and likely China (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). The ‘white’ fins of shark-like rays (including <em>Rhinobatos</em> species)&#160;are considered the best quality fins for human consumption  and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade  (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore&#160;2017). Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish&#160;fins (Chen  1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for&#160;<em>Qun chi</em>&#160;(fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (Hau<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, the fins of the smaller Ringed Guitarfish are of lower value due to their small size and are consumed domestically in China, rather than traded internationally (Zhu and Meng 2001, J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the fins of the larger individual Ringed Guitarfish are removed for consumption, but similar to China, it may be for domestic consumption, as fins of this species or other small <em>Rhinobatos </em>have not been recorded in trade surveys in Hong Kong or Singapore (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 31/01/2020). The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).  The eggs of shark-like rays&#160;are sometimes dried and consumed locally  while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or  fertilizer (Haque&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 29 November 2018).</p>",Marine,"<p>  </p><p>There are no species-specific conservation or management measures in place for this species. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). <br/><br/>There are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019a) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km², are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, there are ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It has a&#160;circumglobal but patchy distribution in temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans, with populations mostly occurring in areas of high upwelling-related productivity. The species is primarily oceanic, but it is also found in coastal waters.&#160;Little is known about its biology and ecology, although it is inferred from other&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;species to produce only one pup every one to three years and therefore, it is likely slow to recover from overfishing.<br/><br/>Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devilray (<em>Mobula</em>&#160;spp.) fisheries worldwide.&#160;The Sicklefin Devilray is a large component of targeted fisheries in India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. This species is also a bycatch component of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported. The lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that globally populations are declining.&#160;In the last decade, significant reductions have been suspected or inferred in three regions: Southeast Asia, the Eastern Pacific, and Indian Ocean where devilrays are heavily exploited. In Indonesia, notable declines in landings of 77–99% over 15 years have been documented. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations would be in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. While wide-ranging movements and migration possibly connect regions and steep local declines may reflect a global population reduction, caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction, especially as the Sicklefin Devilray has a widespread global distribution which likely includes areas of lower fishing pressure. Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Sicklefin Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056) due to ongoing demand for high-value products. The Sicklefin Devilray is therefore assessed as&#160;Endangered A2bd+3d.</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Sicklefin Devilray is primarily oceanic, but is also found in coastal waters, and  appears to be a seasonal visitor along productive coastlines with  regular upwelling in oceanic island groups, and near offshore pinnacles  and seamounts. The Sicklefin Devilray&#160;has been observed traveling both in schools and  in solitude (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara and Hillyer 1989, Sobral and Afonso  2014). The species is highly mobile and capable of significant  migrations. Tagged individuals have traveled over 3,800 km over seven  months and dived to depths of 1,896 m (Thorrold <em>et al.</em> 2014).  In the Pacific, the species only appears in catches in the Gulf of  California during the warmer months, suggesting seasonal migratory  habits (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988). In the Atlantic, the Sicklefin  Devilray&#160;aggregates around the seamounts at the Princess Alice Bank in  the Azores during summer months (Sobral and Afonso 2014). Similar  aggregations are also reported from the St. Peter and St. Paul's  Archipelago in Brazil (Mendonça 2011) and around Cocos Island off Costa  Rica (E. Herreño pers. comm. 10/11/2012).<br/> </p><p>The Sicklefin Devilray is one of the largest mobulid species, attaining a maximum size of 370 cm disc width (DW) (White<em> et al. </em>2017, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Size at maturity is 270–280 cm DW for females and 198–250 cm DW for males (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, White e<em>t al. </em>2006a, Rambahiniarison <em>et al. </em>2018). Mobulid rays are aplacental viviparous with the Sicklefin Devilray producing a single large pup born at 120–130 cm DW (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018, D. Fernando unpubl. data).  Intrinsically, mobulid rays have among the lowest productivity of any&#160;chondrichthyan&#160;(Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). Based on other mobulids, it is likely this species also has a resting period of 1–3 years between pregnancies (Marshall and Bennett 2010, Stevens 2016, Ramahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown; they are inferred from the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pardo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, note that the Giant Devilray reaches a larger size than the Sicklefin Devilray (520 vs 370 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>Mobulid rays, including the Sicklefin Devilray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine fisheries and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). Like many devilrays, Sicklefin Devilray are easy to target because of their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate or predictably use specific habitats, and their general lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p><p><em>Mobula</em>&#160;rays, including the Sicklefin Devilray, are caught in at least 13 targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries. Some of the largest documented fisheries have been in Indonesia, the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, México, Taiwan, Mozambique, Gaza, and Peru (Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Ender and Fernando 2014, Croll&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), In some directed artisanal fisheries, hundreds of Sicklefin Devilray have been observed or estimated to be landed per annum (Alava&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Acebes and Tull 2016). While many artisanal fisheries have grown into trade fisheries, some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Mobulid rays are caught incidentally as bycatch throughout their ranges in at least 21 small-scale fisheries in 15 countries and 9 large-scale fisheries in 11 countries (Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically kept because of their high trade value. Even when discarded alive, for example from tuna purse seine fisheries, they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017).&#160;</p><p>Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and dozens of national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;</p>  <p>Global landings of mobulid species, including the Sicklefin Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley <em>et al.</em> 2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Acebes and Tull 2016). Between 2000 and 2007, total landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack  and Sant 2009). While this equates to an average of 1,593 t being  landed per annum, reported landings are likely to represent only a  fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p><p>In the markets of Guangzhou, China, where 99% of mobulid products are routed, mobulid products are sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The source locations for the largest amounts of product are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand for products has driven up the price and traded volume of these products in recent decades. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid product moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Approximately 13% of the estimated number of devilrays traded annually through the shops in Guangzhou are the Sicklefin Devilray and this species’ gill plates are reported to sell for up to&#160;US$359 per kg (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;</p><p>Off the West African coast in the Atlantic Ocean, the Sicklefin Devilray is the most commonly caught devilray in the tuna purse seine fishery, with an extrapolated 130 t (equating to over 850 individuals) caught between 2003 and 2007 (Amande&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;</p><p>Devilrays are also taken as bycatch in pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries in the Indian Ocean targeting swordfish (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), and the tuna purse seine fishery (Lezama-Ochoa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) but effort trends for these fisheries are unknown. In India, intensive gillnet fisheries take mobulid species, particularly the larger-bodied species like the Sicklefin Devilray, along the western coast (Rajapackiam&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Nair&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that the Sicklefin Devilray composes 12% of the total number of devilrays landed, with an estimated 6,700 Sicklefin Devilray landed annually (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;</p><p></p><p>Throughout Indonesia, the Sicklefin Devilray is the most commonly caught devilray species in many of the regional fisheries (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Some regional fisheries have shown increased effort in terms of number of boats and fishers in recent years, resulting in an increase in local fishing pressure equivalent to an order of magnitude (Dewar 2002). Catches of the Sicklefin Devilray were recorded in the country’s three largest devilray landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor; and, Cilacap, West Java). Devilrays are caught as bycatch (and retained) in drift gillnet Skipjack Tuna (<em><span class=""st"">Katsuwonus pelamis</em>) fisheries in Indonesia, with the Sicklefin Devilray recorded as the second most abundant mobulid species, accounting for 23.5% of the mobulid catch (White <em>et al</em>. 2006b).</p>In the Bohol Sea, Philippines, mobulid rays have been targeted for over a hundred years, however fleet modernization and the introduction of nets have allowed fishers to hunt these rays further afield and target a wider range of species, including the Sicklefin Devilray. Interviews with fishers indicate villages historically took as many as 1,000 devilrays per year (Alava <em>et al. </em>2002, Acebes and Tull 2016). By 2002, when catches were being identified to species, the Sicklefin Devilray reportedly comprised only 2% of the devilray fishery (Department of Agriculture Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2009) but this may not be representative of historical landing percentages.  <p><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB"">In the Western and Central Pacific from 2010–2015, observed bycatch of mobulids (excluding Giant Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>)) in purse seine fisheries was 4,324 individuals, and in longline fisheries was <span lang=""en-GB"">410 individuals.

Much of the devilray take in this area occurs in the Costa Rica Dome region off Central America (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Furthermore<a>, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</a>Population trend data for devilrays are most often not species-specific. Hence, many rates of decline are inferred, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits. Some localized data for the Sicklefin Devilray are available.</p><p>In India, population reductions are suspected based on general declines in devilray catches while effort has increased in several regions, including Kerala, where this species represented 11% of devilrays landed in 2012 (Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), along the Chennai and Tuticorin coasts (Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), and Mumbai (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Trawlers operating out of Mumbai reported maximum landings of 6.3 tonnes (t) for '<em>M. diabolus</em>'&#160;(an invalid, perhaps generalized name for devilrays) in 1993–95, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which fishing effort almost doubled, from which local population declines can be inferred. In Sri Lanka, population reductions are strongly suspected because fishers reported declines in devilray catches over the last decade and a half and a steady increase in fishing pressure (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;</p><p>In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em style="""">Mobula</em>&#160;spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at at least two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis&#160;<em style="""">et al.&#160;</em>2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Sicklefin Devilray declined by 99% in Tanjung Luar, and by 77% in Cilacap (Lewis&#160;<em style="""">et al.&#160;</em>2015).<strong>&#160;</strong>Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Anecdotal information from fishers also suggest that historical declines of the Sicklefin Devilray have occurred in these regions (Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Sicklefin Devilray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;</p><p></p>  <p>Mobulid rays have been targeted for over a hundred years in the Bohol Sea in the Philippines. The number of villages and fishers participating in the fishery expanded at least through 2002, however this expansion in effort was concurrent with steep declines in catch rates, inferring localized depletions (Alava <em>et al.</em> 2002). Despite on-going generalized declines in the landings of mobulid rays, fishing continues, albeit on a much smaller scale (Acebes and Tull 2016). </p>  <p>A 20-year survey (1993–2013) reported a 78% decline in observational sighting records of devilrays around Cocos Island, Costa Rica by recreational SCUBA divers (White <em>et al</em>. 2015). While species-level identifications were not available in this study, dive operators report the Sicklefin Devilray as the species most generally sighted (E. Herreño pers. comm. 10/06/2012). The degree to which this index reflects wider population sizes is unknown. Cocos Island is a marine protected area and lies within the area of activity of the Eastern Tropical Pacific purse seine tuna fisheries which takes large numbers of devilrays as incidental catch (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016). In the Eastern Pacific Ocean, bycatch estimates from purse seine  fisheries increased from 20 t a year before 2005 to a maximum of  150 t a year by 2006, and then reduced to 10 t by 2009 (Hall  and Roman 2013). Grouped species bycatch data such as these are likely  indicative of overall devilray population declines following  over-exploitation in the region.</p>  <p>Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, in particular the major known aggregation areas for the Sicklefin Devilray, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations would be in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. While wide-ranging movements and migration possibly connect regions (Thorrold <em>et al.</em> 2014) and steep local declines may reflect a global population reduction, caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction, especially as the Sicklefin Devilray has a wide global distribution which likely includes areas of lower fishing pressure. Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Sicklefin Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056) due to ongoing demand or high-value products.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sicklefin Devilray has a patchy circumglobal distribution and is found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans (Mendonça 2011, Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Sicklefin Devilray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates. The meat from mobulids, including the Sicklefin Devilray, is often used locally or traded regionally for human consumption, animal feed, and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011, Couturier<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012, Ender and Fernando 2014, Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, F. Doumbouya, pers. comm. 11/10/2015). In some fisheries, this species is often ‘winged’ (i.e. removal of pectoral fins from body) with this product frozen and exported to Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan, pers. comm. 12/05/2017). The cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).

The species has one of the largest distributions of all the mobulids but populations occur most often in highly productive upwelling areas. The Bentfin Devilray has an extremely low reproductive output with one pup born every 1–3 years, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality.<br/><br/>Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devilray (<em>Mobula</em>&#160;spp.) fisheries worldwide.&#160;The Bentfin Devilray is a large component of targeted fisheries in the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Peru, the Republic of Guinea, and México. This species is also a bycatch component of many small and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated and reported as&#160;<em>Mobula&#160;</em>spp. The lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that populations are declining worldwide. Notable declines in landings of 75% over 15 years have been documented at one fishing landing site in Indonesia, while at another site, the species was caught in low numbers in 2001–05 but was not recorded in 2013–14. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations would be in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data.

The Bentfin Devilray is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd+3d.","<p>The <a name=""OLE_LINK6""></a><a name=""OLE_LINK5"">Bentfin</a> Devilray occurs in neritic and oceanic waters from the surface to depths of 100 m (Weigmann 2016). The Bentfin Devilray is a seasonal visitor along productive coastlines with regular upwelling, off oceanic island groups, and near offshore pinnacles and seamounts (Gadig <em>et al.</em> 2003, White <em>et al. </em>2006b, Mendonça 2011, Poortvliet <em>et al</em>. 2015, Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Bentfin Devilray is sighted in both upwelling pelagic environments (Mas <em>et al</em>. 2015) and in shallow, productive, neritic waters (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, Gadig <em>et al.</em> 2003, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). The Bentfin Devilray is not considered to be a schooling species, but individuals do aggregate seasonally in productive areas (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, Casas <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/></p><p>The Bentfin Devilray attains a confirmed maximum size of 197 cm disc width (DW) and possibly reaches 220 cm DW (Jabado and Ebert 2015, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). Size at maturity is 150–163 cm DW for females and 150–158 cm DW for males (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, White <em>et al.</em> 2006a, Rambahiniarison <em>et al. </em>2018). The Bentfin Devilray is aplacental viviparous generally producing a single large pup and occasionally two pups (25% of females examined off the Republic of Guinea had two pups; Doumbouya 2011) born at 70–90 cm DW (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988, <a name=""_Hlk533078003"">Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018</a>). Based on examinations of specimens in fisheries, it appears, like other<em> Mobula</em> species, that the Bentfin Devilray has a resting period of 1–3 years between pregnancies (Rambahiniarison<em> et al.</em> 2018). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown; they are inferred from the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>) which has an age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pardo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, note that the Giant Devilray reaches a considerably larger size than the Bentfin Devilray (520 vs 197 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated. The estimated intrinsic rate of increase of is very low (0.001–0.063) per year (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018)&#160;comparable to other mobulid species and among the lowest of any chondrichthyan assessed to date (Pardo<em> et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Mobulid rays, including the Bentfin&#160;Devilray, are both targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine fisheries and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). Devilrays are often easy to target because of their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate or predictably use specific habitats, and their general lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;The Bentfin&#160;Devilray’s epipelagic tropical distribution in regions of high productivity, which overlaps with that of tuna and other highly valued target teleost (bony fish) species, means it is exposed to multiple targeted and bycatch fisheries (White <em>et al.</em> 2006b, Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). Furthermore, this species’ preference for coastal waters places it within the range of inshore fisheries, which are known to be intensive in many parts of its range, including Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka&#160;(de Young 2006,&#160;Flewelling&#160;and&#160;Hosch&#160;2006).&#160;</p><p>Mobulids, including the Bentfin&#160;Devilray, are caught in at least 13 targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries. Some of the largest documented fisheries have been in India, Indonesia, México, Mozambique, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Peru (Courturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In some regions, directed artisanal fisheries can land hundreds of Bentfin&#160;Devilrays per annum (Alava&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018). Overall, while many artisanal fisheries have grown into trade fisheries, some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Mobulids, including the Bentfin Devilray, are caught incidentally as bycatch throughout their ranges in at least 21 small-scale fisheries in 15 countries and 9 large-scale fisheries in 11 countries (Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically kept because of their high trade value and even when discarded alive they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2016).&#160;</p><p>Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and dozens of national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<br/></p><p>Global landings of mobulid species, including the Bentfin&#160;Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Acebes and Tull 2016). Between 2000 and 2007, total reported landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009). While this equates to an average of 1,593 t being landed per annum, reported landings are likely to represent only a fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).</p><p>Almost all (99%) of mobulid gill plates are destined for the markets of Guangzhou, China, with these products sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). The source locations for the largest product volumes are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand for products has driven up the price of these products in recent decades as well as the volume of product being traded. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid gill plates moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The&#160;Bentfin&#160;Devilray was identified as one of the most prevalent devilray species in the Guangzhou gill plate markets, however because of the similarity to other species’ gill plates such as the Giant Devilray, it was not possible to determine the proportion of&#160;Bentfin&#160;Devilray gill plates in stock estimates; grouped<strong>&#160;</strong>Giant Devilray and other devilray gill plates including the&#160;Bentfin&#160;Devilray made up 30% of market stocks in 2011 (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;</p><p>In the Atlantic Ocean, devilrays are taken as bycatch in the Southwest Atlantic Uruguayan and Japanese Longline Fisheries, which operate within the Uruguayan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and adjacent international waters (Mas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Mas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) estimated that only 201 devilrays were incidentally caught during 1998–2013, equaling a catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.028 individuals per 1,000 hooks, which represents only 0.05% of total catch combined of both fleets. Catches of devilrays, that included Bentfin Devilray, fluctuated with a peak in 2006 of just under ~20 individuals, that decreased then peaked in 2009 at ~50 individuals and remained at this level, until catches fell to &lt;5 in 2013 (Mas<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015).</p><p>There are artisanal fisheries in multiple West African countries that target devilrays for human consumption both locally and for export to other markets (Doumbouya 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Ender and Fernando 2014). While commonly targeted or caught as bycatch, little is known of the extent of these fisheries at present.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk533087102"">In West Africa,&#160;</a><em>Mobula</em>&#160;species, particularly, the Bentfin Devilray have been reported in landings in the Republic of Guinea since 2001, where they are dried and distributed from Kassa (Doumbouya 2011). Fishing areas have extended beyond Guinean territorial waters since 2005, following strong pressure on the resource in the northern part of the coast. Breeding areas have been identified off Alcatraz Island and Kamsar Buoy and this species is targeted from January to March, which corresponds to the pupping season and breeding season, suggesting this fishery may be negatively impacting the species (Doumbouya 2011). Industrial trawlers operating off the northwest African coast also capture devilrays, which likely include the Bentfin Devilray (Zeeberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).</p><p></p>  <p>In the Indian Ocean, specifically India, intensive gillnet fisheries take mobulid species, including the Bentfin Devilray, along the western coast (Rajapackiam&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015). In Sri Lanka, an estimated 449 Bentfin Devilray were landed annually, based on market surveys in 2011 (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Devilrays are also taken as bycatch in pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries in the Indian Ocean targeting swordfish (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), and the tuna purse seine fishery (Lezama-Ochoa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) but effort trends for these fisheries are unknown. In Pakistan, Bentfin Devilray represented 7% of the mobulids landed by number in tuna gillnet fisheries (Nawaz and Khan 2015). In Oman and the Saudi Red Sea, only a few specimens of this species were recorded during extensive landing site surveys (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007,&#160;Spaet and Berumen 2015).</p><p>In Indonesia, catches of the Bentfin Devilray have been recorded in the country’s three largest devilray landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor; and Cilacap, West Java) (White <em>et al.</em> 2006b). In the Bohol Sea, Philippines, mobulid rays have been targeted for over a hundred years, however fleet modernization and the introduction of nets have allowed fishers to hunt these rays further afield and target a wider range of species (Alava<em> et al. </em>2002, Acebes and Tull 2016). Interviews with fishers indicate villages historically took as many as 1,000 devilrays per year (Alava <em>et al. </em>2002, Acebes and Tull 2016). </p>    <p><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB"">In the Western and Central Pacific from 2010–2015, observed bycatch of mobulids (excluding Giant Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>)) in purse seine fisheries was 4,324 individuals, and in longline fisheries was <span lang=""en-GB"">410  individuals.

range of 1,100–6,500 (Croll et al. 2016). Much of the devilray take in this area occurs in the Costa Rica Dome region off Central America (Croll <em>et al. </em>  2016). The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) purse seine   vessels operating during 2015 in the Pacific reported landings of 71 t   of mobulid species, that likely included the Bentfin Devilray (Miller   and Klimovich 2017).&#160;A longstanding targeted mobulid fishery existed off Baja California Sur, Mexio with the Bentfin Devilray the most commonly landed species (58% of total numbers of catch) (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988). By the early 1980, concern existed over the sustainability of Bentfin Devilray landings with 72% of individuals reported as immature (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1988). By the late 1990s, the primary target of this fishery had shifted to the Pygmy Devilray (<em>M. munkiana</em>) and Bentfin Devilrays were a minor component of landings (Bizzarro <em>et al.</em> 2009a). During the same time period, Bentfin Devilrays were rarely encountered among elasmobranch landings from the more temperate northern Gulf of California (Bizzarro <em>et al. </em>2009b, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2009). Recent landings data from this region are unavailable due to the ban on capture of mobulid species, however, fisheries for these species continue to operate.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><a>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other pollution and contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</a><a>Furthermore, shallow water lagoon systems have been identified as important nursery habitats of other mobulids. The effects of habitat destruction and degradation and pollution in these systems may affect the survival of juvenile Bentfin Devilrays (Stewart <em>et al.</em> </a><a>2018).</a></p>","<p>  </p><p>There are no historical baseline population data and global population numbers are unknown for any devilray species. Globally, however, genus-wide declines are suspected based on a combination of declining sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) data from monitored populations, catch landings data, and evidence of depletions (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Hall and Roman 2013, Ward-Paige<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013,&#160;Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016, Rohner <em>et al.</em> 2017). Furthermore<a>, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;</a>Population trend data for devilrays are most often not species-specific. Hence, many of rates of decline are inferred or suspected, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits. Some localized data for the Bentfin Devilray are available.<br/><br/>In the Atlantic Ocean waters off the Republic of Guinea, landings of&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;species, that include the Bentfin Devilray, are declining and a decrease in maximum observed sizes was observed from 2001–2010 (Doumbouya 2011).<br/><br/>In India, population reductions are inferred based on general declines in devilray catches. Despite increasing effort in several regions, including Kerala (Nair&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), along the Chennai and Tuticorin coasts (Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), and Mumbai (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009), catches indicate depletion of stocks. Trawlers in Mumbai reported maximum landings of 6.3 t for '<em>M. diabolus'</em><em>&#160;</em>(an invalid, perhaps generalized name for devilrays) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which time fishing effort almost doubled, from which local population declines can be inferred. Off Sri Lanka, population reductions are strongly suspected because  fishers reported declines in devilray catches over the last decade  and a half with a steady increase in fishing pressure, with the Bentfin Devilray the third most commonly landed&#160;<em>Mobula&#160;</em>species in the country (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula</em> spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Bentfin Devilray declined by 75% in Tanjung Luar, and by 100% in Cilacap (that is, the species was not recorded in 2014) (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Bentfin Devilray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, mobulids have been targeted for over a hundred years in the Bohol Sea. The number of villages and fishers participating in the fishery expanded at least through to 2002, however this expansion in effort was concurrent with steep declines in catch rates, leading to inferred localized depletions (Alava <em>et al.</em> 2002). The most commonly landed species in these fisheries has been the Bentfin Devilray, with a recent fisheries survey in Jagna showing they represented 54% of the annual catch from the Bohol Sea (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018). Despite on-going generalized declines in the landings of mobulid rays, fishing continues in this region, albeit on a much smaller scale (Acebes and Tull 2016).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, bycatch estimates from purse seine fisheries increased from 20 t per year before 2005 up to a maximum of 150 t per year by 2006, and then reduced to 10 t by 2009 (Hall and Roman 2013). While population trends cannot be directly taken from grouped species bycatch data such as these, this pattern may be indicative of overall devilray population declines following over-exploitation in the region. Moreover, it is likely a high percentage of the landings may be attributed to the Bentfin Devilray. In Tumbes, Peru, while reported devilray landings fluctuate considerably from year to year there was a significant decline from an apparent peak of 1,188 t in 1999 (Llanos <em>et al</em>. 2010), to 135 t in 2013 (IMARPE 2014). Llanos <em>et al</em>. (2010) described all devilrays landed as the Bentfin Devilray, but these statistics probably also include other species. A more recent fishery survey found mobulid landings in Tumbes between 2013 and 2014 consisted mainly of the Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>), with only 1% of the catch being Bentfin Devilrays (SOSF 2014).<br/><br/>Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, in particular major known aggregation areas for the Bentfin Devilray, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations would be in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction, especially as the Bentfin Devilray has a wide global distribution which likely includes areas of lower fishing pressure. Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Bentfin Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056) due to ongoing demand or high-value products.</p><span lang=""EN-AU""><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Bentfin Devilray has a circumglobal distribution and is found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans (Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lawson<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>The Bentfin Devilray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates. The meat from mobulid rays, including the Bentfin Devilray, is often used locally or traded regionally for human consumption, animal feed, and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ender and Fernando 2014, Croll&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016, F. Doumbouya pers. comm. 11/10/2011). In some fisheries, this species is often ‘winged’ (i.e. removal of pectoral fins from body) with this product frozen and exported to Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia (M.&#160;Khan pers. comm. 12/05/2017). The cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

124452001,60205,Mustelus minicanis,Endangered,A2bd,2020,2020-02-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus minicanis</em>) is a small (to 72 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic and is known primarily from Colombia and Venezuela, with one specimen recorded from off French Guiana. It inhabits the continental shelf at depths of 71–183 m. It is targeted or captured as bycatch in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal trawl and longline fisheries throughout its geographic range. It is typically utilized as food and consumed or sold locally. Smoothhounds in general are targeted and highly valued in Venezuela, and this species is caught in large numbers. Smoothhound landings (combined&#160;<em>Mustelus&#160;</em>spp.) declined significantly over a recent 8-year period in Venezuela. These declines are the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction if scaled to three generation lengths of the Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound&#160;(28 years). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The declines seen in Venezuela are not expected to be representative of the situation in Colombia where smoothhounds are not as intensely fished. Given this balance, along with the species' likely moderate-high biological productivity, it is suspected that the Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound has under undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (28 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p><p><br/></p>","The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound is a poorly-known houndshark that inhabits the outer continental shelf at depths of 71–183 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 72 cm total length (TL) and both sexes mature at 45 cm TL (Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2017). Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 5–6&#160;pups per litter that are 22 cm TL at birth (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2017). Generation length is estimated to be ~9.3 years, similar to that of the Narrownose Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus schmitti</em>), which has an age-at-maturity of 7.6 years and a maximum age of 11 years (Molina <em>et al. </em>2017). The Narrownose Smoothhound reaches a larger size (to 109 cm TL; Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013) than the Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound and this generation length is likely an overestimate. The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound is likely to have a moderate-high biological productivity due to its small size and probable fast growth.","The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound is captured in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal trawl and longline fisheries. Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast of Colombia in the mid-1960s and expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). In the mid-2000s this fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world, although this species was not recorded (Duarte <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced in the 1940s there and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Industrial fleets of vessels that fish with longlines and handlines  operate there and also venture further afield to the Guianas and as far  as northern Brazil (Mendoza 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Smoothhounds in general are targeted and highly valued in Venezuela, and this species is caught in large numbers in places such as Margarita Island (Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2017). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth<em> et al. </em>2001). In French Guiana, shrimp trawl fisheries began in the 1960s with foreign vessels from the US and Japan which were then replaced in the 1980s by French vessels. Effort peaked in the mid-1990s and has declined since, but it is suspected that this may be largely due to changing environmental conditions that no longer favor shrimp recruitment in these waters (Chaboud and Thébaud 2009, Sanz <em>et al. </em>2017). There are also commercial artisanal and subsistence fisheries along the entire coast of French Guiana (Harper <em>et al.</em> 2015). Overall, this houndshark is subjected to intense fishing pressure across its range that is inadequately managed, and it has no refuge at depth. Other smoothhounds that are fished are often able to withstand well-managed fishing pressure, however in other areas that lack management their stocks have collapsed (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Colloca<em> et al. </em>2017).","In Colombia, this species has been rarely reported (Moreno <em>et al. </em>2008, Grijalba <em>et al. </em>2009). In Venezuela, smoothhound landings (combined <em>Mustelus </em>spp.) declined significantly over a recent 8-year period. These declines are the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction if scaled to three generation lengths of the Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound (28 years).&#160;<br/><br/>Although inshore fishing pressure is also high in Colombia, the population declines seen in Venezuela are not expected to be representative of the situation in Colombia. Given this balance and accounting for the species' life history, it is suspected that the Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound has under undergone a population reduction of 50–79%  over the past three generations  (28 years).",Decreasing,"The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound occurs in the Western Central Atlantic from northeast Colombia off La Guajira Department and from Venezuela north of the Gulf of Venezuela and north of Sucre State (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013), and one additional specimen from off French Guiana in the Southwest Atlantic (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2018).","This houndshark is utilized as food and consumed or sold locally. Demand for shark meat in Brazil is increasing, and the country is one of the world’s top importers of shark meat. Imports have increased more than 8-fold since 2000 (Dent and Clarke 2015), and smoothhounds such as this species that are landed in neighboring countries may increasingly be exported from their country of origin to meet Brazilian demand, particularly where prices fetched are higher for exports than for local sales.",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in place for this shark. A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is inadequate. Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in national territory and up to 5% in the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia, and Santa Catalina; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. Management measures including harvest limits and species-specific monitoring are needed in order to ensure that this shark does not become more threatened in the near future. Further research is needed on life history, distribution, and population size and trends.","",,false,false,Global

It likely has very low biological productivity, based on other&#160;<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;species, and is&#160;unable to sustain intense target or bycatch fishing   pressure. The species<em> </em>currently has refuge from fishing pressure at depth in some parts of its range, and trawl fishing pressure and targeted fishing pressure has  dramatically declined over the past few decades in Japan and the  Maldives, respectively. Overall, it is&#160;suspected   that the Mosaic Gulper Shark has undergone a population reduction of   50–79% over the past three generation lengths (83 years) due to levels   of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Mosaic Gulper Shark is demersal on the upper continental slope at depths of 260–820 m (Nakabo 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm total length (TL), male and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nakabo 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproductive periodicity is unknown but could be 2–3 years based on other <em>Centrophorus</em> species (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely-related and similar-sized species, the Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus granulosus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 16.5 years and a maximum age of 39 years, resulting in a generation length of 27.8 years (Guallart 1998).","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. Like other gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em> spp.), it is presumably taken as a target catch and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears including deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet, and retained for the meat, fins, and liver oil.</p>In Japan, the sympatric Dwarf Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus atromarginatus</em>) was targeted for its liver oil in Suruga Bay, Honshu with deep-water longlines (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). It was also taken as bycatch of demersal gillnets and retained for the meat and fins (McCormack and White 2009). The Mosaic Gulper Shark occurs in the same area and was likely also targeted and taken as bycatch and retained. It could be currently captured in Suruga Bay by demersal gillnets that target fish and crustaceans at depths of 100–500 m. A deepwater dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019) and may capture this species. Elsewhere in its Japan range, it may be captured by demersal trawl fisheries that operate at depths of 200–800 m (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a><a name=""_Hlk21438533""></a>Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019). <br/><p></p><p>In the Maldives, targeted <em>Centrophorus</em> fishing for the liver oil was intense during the 1980s to the early 1990s when the collapse of the stocks led to the cessation of the fishery (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). There has been no targeted shark fishing in the Maldives since 2010. In Hawaii, the Mosaic Gulper Shark is known from O'ahu at 260–370 m (Mundy 2005). It is possibly captured in the demersal fish fishery operating in the  Hawaiian Archipelago that targets deep-water snappers and groupers (<em>Etelis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Pristipomoides</em>&#160;spp.) at depths &lt;400 m (DLNR 2019). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the&#160;Southern Emperor Seamounts and Northern Hawaiian Ridge were heavily exploited by Japanese and Russian industrial vessels targeting Alfonsino&#160;(<em>Beryx splendens</em>) and&#160;Armourhead (<em>Pseudopentaceros wheeleri</em>) (Shotton 2016). Trawl and longline fishing generally occurred at depths 300–400 m, and Japanese gillnet fisheries operated at depths of 300–1,300 m (Shotton 2016). These fisheries ceased within the Hawaiian  Archipelago after the declaration of the United States Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) in 1977 (Clark&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019), however, the effects of historic fishing effort, if any, on the species is unknown.</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for the Mosaic Gulper Shark. Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of gulper sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp). Gulper sharks are highly susceptible to  population reduction from fishing activities because of their slow life  histories, that is, slow growth rates, late maturity, and low fecundity (Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009). Targeted gulper shark fisheries have experienced significant  reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch or have altogether collapsed over a  relatively short time (&lt;20 years) (Graham <em>et al. </em>2001, Ali 2015). In Japan, research surveys using dropline and demersal longline  reported 355 individual <em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp.  across 125 hauls and 55,000  hooks, which included 93 Mosaic Gulper Shark at 300–800 m but mostly at 600 m (Yano  and  Kugai 1993, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In 2003, a demersal trawl survey reported a catch-per-unit-effort of  1–6 <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. individuals per tow caught between 500–1,000 m but did not report any Mosaic Gulper Shark (Yamada <em>et al.</em>   2007). These surveys have used different methods and are thus not directly  comparable, but could indicate the species is found at low density in   the region.</p><p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a>, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Japan, fishing effort has declined by about one third since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). The reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort, which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. This represents a 99% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (83 years) of the Mosaic Gulper Shark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of the species in Japan. <br/></p><p></p><p>In the Maldives, the gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.) stock collapsed in the early 2000s and this likely included the Mosaic Gulper Shark<em>. </em>This collapse was&#160;due to targeted fishing after only about 20 years of exploitation and demonstrates the susceptibility&#160;of <em>Centrophorus </em>species to overfishing. Time-series data are not available for catches or landings, although there are data for shark liver oil exports. These show a peak in 1982 soon after the fishery commenced followed by a general downwards trend until 1989, increases in 1990 and 1991, before a complete crash sometime thereafter as available data shows very low export figures for 1996 onward (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007, Ali 2015, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). The fishery has ceased and since 2010 there is no shark fishing in the Maldives. The stock of&#160;<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.&#160;is, however, inferred to have declined by &gt;80%, which infers a &gt;80% reduction in the population of the Mosaic Gulper Shark over the past three generation lengths (83 years).

The effort that each vessel is likely to exert is calculated (based on size, duration of license and past fishing history) and, since 1994, only a limited number of licences are granted to ensure that the total allowable effort (determined from assessments of stock status) is not exceeded. Stock status assessments are not, however, species-specific and a sustainable total allowable effort for the entire stock may not translate to sustainable levels of effort for individual species (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000). Following declines in CPUE in the early 1990s, in 1996, the southern area (below 52°S) was closed to rajid fishing and the fishery is now restricted to the area north of the islands. This closure is extended to 50°30'S (between 56°30W and 58°W) during the second season of each year to exclude the skate fishing fleet from Patagonian Longfin Squid (<em>Doryteuthis gahi</em>) fishing grounds (Agnew <em>et al.</em> 2000). All licensed vessels there are required to provide daily catch and effort details, including discards of commercial and non-commercial species to the Falkland Island Fisheries Department.

In the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Lions region, for example, was initially exploited by small-scale demersal trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp); by 1974−1987 effort had increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp (Soldo and Guallart 2015). &#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In Mauritania, there are&#160;demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp.). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at 100–400 m (Cervantes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;<br/><br/>There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/><br/>West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable&#160;in the short term (FAO 2020).","Species-specific population trend data are not available for the Angular Roughshark. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant datasets for fish and elasmobranch landings and catch rates that are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The Angular Roughshark is generally reported as uncommon or rare, and a number of reports suggest the species has undergone local extinction in the Mediterranean (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2003). The Angular Roughshark is one of several chondrichthyan species that were historically reported as common on trawl fishing grounds off the Balearic Islands and Adriatic Sea; these species are no longer detected in scientific surveys and have nearly disappeared from commercial landings (Soldo and Guallart 2016, Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2020). Large declines (&gt;90%) or the altogether disappearance of neritic and slope species have been documented across the Mediterranean Sea between the 1940/50s and 1990s (Aldebert 1997, Maynou <em>et al</em>. 2011, Colloca <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>There are few data on the occurrence of this species in the Northeast Atlantic. There many deep-water sharks have exhibited population reductions of &gt;80% over three generation lengths after years of intensive targeted fishing (e.g. see Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2018, ICES-WGEF 2019).<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generation lengths (60 years). Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across West Africa, total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950–2010, while the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of artisanal and industrial vessels declined by 34% over this period (Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018). The average elasmobranch catch has increased by nearly 6-fold from 1,399 t in 1950 to 8,329 t in 2015, while the average fishing effort has increased by a factor of nearly 43 during this time period (2,994 kW to 127,798 kW) (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>The Angular Roughshark is suspected to be declining across its distribution where historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high (Fernández et al. 2005, Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019) and previous declines in deep-water sharks have been documented (for example, see Finucci <em>et al</em>. 2018). Overall, it is suspected that the Angular Roughshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) based on actual levels of exploitation and is assessed as Endangered A2d.",Decreasing,The Angular Roughshark is found in the Northeast and Eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Norway to South Africa) and the Mediterranean Sea (absent from the Black Sea) (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Records from Mozambique require further verification (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013).,"The species is used for human consumption, fishmeal, and liver oil.",Marine,"<p>Further information is required on population size and trends of the Angular Roughshark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic. In 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Angular Roughshark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2019). Since 2017, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2019).&#160;</p>In the Mediterranean,&#160;the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned demersal trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in 2005, but this is unlikely provide any refuge for the species.  <p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It reaches a maximum size of 36 cm total length (TL); females mature at 17.6 cm TL and males at 22.8 cm TL. Reproduction is viviparous and females give birth to 1–6 pups that are 10 cm TL at birth (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2015). Generation length is suspected to be 3.1 years, similar to that of the congeneric Smalleye Round Ray (<em>Urotrygon microphthalmum</em>) for which the generation length was calculated from a demographic analysis that used an average modeled natural mortality (Santander-Neto 2015).","The Venezuelan Round Ray is captured in industrial and artisanal shallow demersal trawl fisheries and in artisanal beach seines (Acevedo <em>et al. </em>2015, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have been severely depleted (Duarte<em> et al. </em>2010). This ray is captured as bycatch in beach seines and trawls there, but there are no data on the amount caught (Téllez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Acevedo<em> et al. </em>2015). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack adequate management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal teleosts was introduced in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015); fishing intensity increased for several decades and peaked at ~9,000t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al. </em>2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to only 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Artisanal fishing continues with little management, and northwestern Venezuela is heavily populated. Overall, this species is subjected to heavy fishing pressure across much of its range, and it has no refuge at depth. The status of this ray is of great concern given its restricted known range and its  occurrence in shallow inshore waters, where coastal artisanal fishing  pressure is intense.","This species is still caught in Colombian fisheries as bycatch, but has largely disappeared from catches in Venezuela (Téllez<em> et al.</em> 2006, Acevedo <em>et al.</em> 2015).

It is demersal on the inner continental shelf down to a depth of 60 m. The species is mainly taken as retained bycatch of industrial and artisanal trammel nets, gillnets, and longlines and the meat is consumed locally and fins of larger individuals are possibly traded. There is a moderate level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well landings declines of all sharks and rays and for white-spotted guitarfishes that indicate landings declines of 99% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. In general, there are not many fish landing sites along the south coast of Java and, hence, there are some areas where there is very low or no fishing pressure that may be refuge or this species. Moreover, some catch data for this species show an increasing trend in the last five years, which may indicate increased targeting but also highlights that this species is not yet in severe decline.

Although there is little or no trawling close inshore around Bali and Lombok, trawlers do operate in other parts of this species’ range. The low numbers of this species observed in Java may be a result of overfishing from fishing methods such as trawling in the past (W.T. White unpubl. data 2006). <br/><br/>Globally, guitarfishes are subject to intense fishing pressure on their coastal and shelf habitats that is unregulated across the majority of their distributions. Guitarfishes are captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for their meat, and only the fins of the largest individuals are retained (Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). There is a moderate level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Indonesian Guitarfish, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in significant areas of the Indo-West Pacific, including India and Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays, including guitarfishes, may be targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net fisheries and increasing fishing effort has put significant pressure on all guitarfish species in the Indo-West Pacific. The Indonesian Guitarfish is landed throughout its range and Indonesia is ranked the top shark fishing nation globally (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore, soft-bottom habitat preferred by this species is threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore 2017). In Southeast Asia there has been an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p></p>","Where Rhinopristiformes (sawfishes, wedgefishes, giant guitarfishes, and guitarfishes) have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred (e.g. Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2016, Moore 2017, Jabado 2018, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, there are no species-specific time-series data available for guitarfish species that can be used to calculate population reduction. This is due to a lack of species-specific reporting as well as taxonomic and identification issues (Jabado 2018).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In the cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall effort has decreased.&#160; In fact, as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean within the Indonesian EEZ, elasmobranch catches increased in the mid-1960s to early-1970s with catches peaking at 955 t before plummeting to less than 200 t until 1995. Catches peaked again in 1998 at 969 t and have since declined to less than 35 t in 2013 and 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). When scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) of the Indonesian Guitarfish, this indicates a decline of 99%.<br/><br/>Landings data for 'whitespotted wedgefishes' are available from Indonesia for 2005–2015 (DGCF 2015, 2017). This grouping may include giant guitarfishes, but in any case, the trends can be considered representative of long-lived rhinobatid guitarfishes. Landings declined by 88% over this period, which is the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over the last three generations (30 years).<br/><br/>In general, there are not many fish landings along the south coast of Java. There are some areas where there is very low or no fishing pressure along the south coast of Java that may be refuge areas for the species. Moreover, some catch data for this species show an increase trend in the last five years (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). The Indonesian Guitarfish has a narrow inshore distribution near to heavily populated areas, but there maybe some refuge from fisheries due to paucity of fish landing sites along the south coast of Java. Considering this fishing pressure alongside the recent increase in catch trends and potential partial refuge from fishing, it is suspected that the Indonesian Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (30 years) and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.",Decreasing,"The Indonesian Guitarfish is found in the Eastern Indian Ocean and is endemic to the south coast of Java, Bali and Lombok in central Indonesia (Last<em> et al.</em> 2006, Last <em>et al. </em>2016).

Landings records of sharks from the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries, where gillnet fishing pressure is intense, indicate a decline in Whitenose Shark landings from 600 t in 1969 to 200 t in 2014 (with fishing ongoing). Targeted  fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were  in operation by the early 1960s. In Guatemala in the 1990s,  this was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, but in 2006–2007 landings surveys, this species was encountered at lower levels, and two years of surveys from 2017–2018 only recorded two individuals. In Costa Rica, trawl surveys conducted between  2008 and 2012 failed to record the species even though it was present there in  the 1980s.

Reproduction is placental viviparous and females give birth to five pups per litter with a size-at-birth of 53 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

There is intense artisanal gillnet fishing in the Gulf of California that is known to have caused declines in large pelagic sharks and other marine species (Sala<em> et al.</em> 2004). There is a shrimp trawl fishery that likely interacts with this species  in the southern Gulf of California, and management  issues such as overcapacity and  declining catches have been cited in  that fishery (Foster and Vincent  2010). Artisanal gillnets are common further south in Mexico and do land this shark (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Costa Rica, it is caught by  pelagic and demersal longliners and has been recorded in the shrimp trawl fishery there (Campos 1986). Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' Central and South American  range. This species is recorded in landings in Ecuador (Estupiñán-Montaño <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Peru, pressure on inshore shark species is high,  particularly houndsharks, but it is likely that the Whitenose Shark is also a component of landings there. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","Landing records of Whitenose Shark&#160;from Gulf of California artisanal fisheries indicate a peak catch of about 500 t in 1969 and another smaller peak of over 300 t in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Catch was lower over the next several decades, remaining at about 100 t annually through the 1990s and early 2000s. At the end of the time-series, Whitenose Shark catches increased to around 200 t in 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Intense artisanal gillnet  pressure in the Gulf of California has led to declines in pelagic  sharks and other marine species (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Targeted fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were  already in operation in the early 1960s (Kato 1965). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, this species made up a small portion of the catch in artisanal fisheries, but was the fourth most captured shark between 1996 and 2003 (Soriano-Velásquez <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Guatemala in the 1990s, this species was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, representing about 12% of the catch. In 2006–2007 landings surveys these animals were encountered at lower levels with only 29 individuals reported. Two years of surveys from 2017–2018 only recorded two individuals (C. Avalos-Castillo unpubl. data 2018). In Costa Rica, 346 trawls between 2008 and 2012 failed to record the species even though it was present in the 1980s (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2016). Catches in Colombia were relatively common in the 1990s, but it has rarely been recorded since. Landings do occur in Ecuador, and a lack of management there leads to suspicion of a population reduction. A few individuals were recorded in Peruvian landings in the late 1990s, but it has not been recorded since (X. Velez-Zuazo unpubl. data 2019). Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its  range, combined with an increasing rarity of records, it is suspected  that this shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the  past three generations (27 years).",Decreasing,"The Whitenose Shark occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Baja California, Mexico to Peru including the Gulf of California and the Galápagos Islands (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).",This shark is retained and the meat is consumed locally. Fins may be exported internationally.,Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation measures in  place for the Whitenose Shark. In the Mexican Pacific, there is a closed season for targeted elasmobranch fishing   from May 1st to July 31st, but enforcement is inadequate (O.   Sosa-Nishizaki unpubl. data 2019). A temporal ban of shrimp trawl fisheries is established in Colombia (January to March) but enforcement is also inadequate (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2017). Additionally, targeted industrial fishing of sharks and rays is prohibited in Colombia, with set bycatch limits (up to 35% of bycatch in the national territory; Resolution 1743 of 2017); however, surveillance and compliance requires strengthening. The Galápagos&#160;Archipelago is covered by the 133,000 km² Galápagos Marine Reserve which prohibits industrial fishing but allows artisanal fishing (Davos&#160;<em>et al. </em>2007). However, the enforcement of regulations is limited and illegal fishing is prevalent, particularly for sharks (Hearn&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>To conserve the population and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which will need to include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest&#160;management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement. Further research is needed on distribution, population size and trends, threats, and use and trade, and species-specific monitoring should be undertaken in commercial and artisanal fisheries.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–150 m and also occurs in rocky habitats and estuaries. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet and is retained for consumption across most of its range.<br/><br/>Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 37–95% over the past three generation lengths (40 years). These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Banded Houndshark. Once common, it is now low in abundance in Japan,  infrequently landed in Taiwan, and although regularly observed in South Korea, less than 10  individuals are landed at a time. Rocky habitat in some parts of its range and the inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Banded Houndshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (40 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Banded Houndshark is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 30–150 m (Weigmann 2016). The species occurs in sandy and rocky habitats and in estuaries or shallow bays, on sand, seaweed, and seagrass flats and is tolerant of reduced salinities (Compagno 1984, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL), males mature at 91 cm TL and females mature at 106 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, Fujinama and Tanaka 2013, Wiegmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 8–29 (average 9–10)<strong> </strong>and size-at-birth of 18 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a).&#160;Female age-at-maturity is estimated as 8.6 years, and maximum age is 18 years (Fujinama and Tanaka 2013); generation length is therefore 13.3 years.","<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Banded Houndshark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. It is retained for human consumption across its range except in some parts of Japan where it is possibly discarded. Small mesh sizes are used in nets throughout this species' range. This species is a more popular bycatch in Japan since the near–disappearance of the more desired Starspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>) from southern Japan over the last two decades.<br/></p>  <p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Banded Houndshark. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletion, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante<em> et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>In South Korea, the Banded Houndshark is a retained bycatch of trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout Korean coastal waters that target sculpin (<em>Cottus koreanus</em>) and flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>) (C-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered  overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the  Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The number of powered  vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the  1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and  then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010,  Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National  Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The artisanal fishing  effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans  (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers.  comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been  high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in  China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/></p><p></p><p></p>      <p>In Japan, this species was previously reported to have refuge from fishing in nearshore rocky unfished areas off Japan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, demersal longline fishing effort has since increased in those rocky habitats and this habitat no longer provides a refuge from fishing pressure. Historically, across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NMFT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b).</p>","<p></p><p>There are no species-specific time-series available. The Banded Houndshark was previously considered common-to-abundant (Compagno 1984). It is now observed at very low abundance in the southern waters of Japan, although aggregations are seen by divers off Sakata, Tobishima Island (H. Ishihara unpubl. data 2019). It is regularly seen at fish markets on the south coast of South Korea and is considered the most abundant shark in Republic of Korea's waters, however this abundance is typically judged relative to other depleted species and &lt;10 individuals at a time are observed (C-H. Jeong unpubl. data 2019). It is infrequently landed in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b) and is a rare species in Russia (Dyldin and Orlov 2018) which is at the northern extent of its range.<br/></p><p>  </p><p>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953 to 2015<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The annual landings rose from ~8300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.</a></p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""> Japan, China, and Republic of Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</a></p>  <p>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>  <p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Banded Houndshark (40 years) they represent declines of 37%, 94%, 50%, and 95% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the spatial and depth range of the Banded Houndshark. Once common and abundant, it is now in low abundance in southern Japan, infrequently landed in Taiwan, and although regularly landed in South Korea and considered abundant compared to other depleted species, &lt;10 individuals are seen at a time. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, across its range, the Banded Houndshark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (40 years).</p>  <p></p><p></p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Banded Houndshark is endemic to the Northwest Pacific where it occurs in Russia (Vladivostok and southern Kuril Islands), Japan, Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and China (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013a, Dyldin and Orlov 2018). Its presence in the Philippines is uncertain and requires verification.","Banded Houndshark meat is used for human consumption throughout most of its  range; it is not consumed in some prefectures in Japan  where the cultural norm is not to eat shark meat (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). In parts of southern Japan, the meat (locally known as ""<em>modama</em>"") is  preferred over previously popular, but now depleted, Starspotted  Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>). More recently in Korea, the  Banded Houndshark has become popular in raw fish restaurants (C-H.  Jeong unpubl. data 2019). It is likely that the fins, although small, enter the fin trade (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species is popular in aquaria and among scuba divers, the latter particularly in Sakata, Tobishima Island (H. Ishihara unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial bottom trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/></span></p>  <p>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).   </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is demersal on the continental shelf&#160; at depths of 15–50 m.<br/><br/>The species is likely taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, set net, and coastal trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo </em>spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high. <br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. In addition to artisanal fisheries in coastal areas, there are frequent incursions into these waters by distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the West African Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The West African Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates, and found in the vicinity of estuaries, in shallow coastal waters at depths of 15–50 m (Capapé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). It reaches a maximum size of 50 cm total length (TL), males mature at 31.5 cm TL and females mature at 35 cm TL (Capapé&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays, gestation period is 4–5 months and size-at-birth is 9.2–9.6 cm TL (Capapé&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001). There is no information on this species'  age-at-maturity and maximum  age, hence, generation length is inferred based on data for the Marbled  Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 12  years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16  years (Mellinger 1971). However, this should be used with caution, as  it is noted that the West African Torpedo reaches a smaller maximum size than  the Marbled Torpedo (50 cm vs 100 cm TL).","The West African Torpedo is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. Information on post-release survival is limited, but it is suspected to be high (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker et al. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the West African Torpedo that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The West African Torpedo was recorded in Senegal between 1994 and 1998 where 78 specimens were captured using gillnets and landed, indicating that fishers there retain this species (Capapé <em>et al</em>. 2001). However, it was not recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of torpedo rays were recorded in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). It was also not recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985 and 1988 (Mar 2008). In The Gambia, one individual was found discarded dead on the beach during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). It has also not been detected in recent surveys in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago), in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019, in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained here despite its low economic value), in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded here), in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries), and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018, although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In Western Ghana, based on landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, torpedo rays represented 9% of ray landings (7% were identified as the Common Torpedo Ray (<em>Torpedo torpedo</em>) while 2% were likely a mix of the West African Torpedo and the Rosette Torpedo (<em>T. bauchotae</em>)) (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, torpedo rays are frequently captured but discarded alive, and they are also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and are also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Despite being morphologically distinct and easy to identify, this species was not listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys in 2004 (Congo, Gabon, and Angola), 2006 (Nigeria, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), 2007 (Angola), 2008 (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), and 2010 (Gabon and Congo) (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2006, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, other torpedo rays with similar catchability (e.g., the Marbled Torpedo Ray and the Common Torpedo Ray) were captured in up to 18.9% of trawl hauls in surveys between Guinea and Morocco (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. The average elasmobranch landings in the region were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the West African Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation.<span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span style=""""><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The West African Torpedo is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Senegal to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).

The West African Torpedo may be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas <em>et al</em>. 2019).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the West African Torpedo are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 52–400 m, and possibly to 835 m. The species is a bycatch of&#160;demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. Species-specific catch rates from Japan indicate a relatively stable population over the past 36 years (~one and a half generation lengths). Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the China and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 52–99% over the past three generation lengths (63 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Most of the distribution of the species is in Taiwan, China, and South Korea where historic and current fishing pressure is high. The inshore trawl and gillnet  bans in Taiwan and China, respectively, may afford the species some  refuge from fishing pressure. In Japan, where the population appears  stable, fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort is decreasing and  continuing to decline. It is inferred that the Japanese Spurdog has  undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths  (63 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.&#160;</p>","<p>The Japanese Spurdog is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 52–400 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016), and possibly to 835 m (Yano and Kugai 1993). It reaches a maximum size of 105 cm total length (TL); males mature at 50–70 cm TL and females mature at 56–80 cm TL (Chen <em>et al. </em>1981, Goto 1998, Yano and Kugai 1993, Siao 2010, Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2–8 pups, a gestation period of 11–12 months, and size-at-birth of 24 cm TL (Chen <em>et al. </em>1981, Goto 1988, Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 19.3 years and maximum age is 22 years, resulting in a generation length of 21 years (Siao 2010).</p>","<p>The Japanese Spurdog is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch by demersal trawl, longline, and possibly gillnet, and is retained (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). These gears operate across most of the species' depth range, with the exception of China where trawls operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk21698750"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the  1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a  reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical  mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White  Paper 2015). </a><a name=""_Hlk22647605"">The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em>  2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight  decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ  declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003,  Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019a). </a><a name=""_Hlk21701990""></a><a name=""_Hlk21701973""></a>Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three  decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant  decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the  fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry  (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The  trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial  and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand  for seafood in Japan and South Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5  kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of  neighboring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019a, Helgil 2019a).<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes,  and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a  reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’  effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman  and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now  consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still  retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The  northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<a name=""_Hlk21696013""> </a><br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019b, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019b, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinya and Liu 2014).</p>","<p>In Japan, catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data is available for this species from Okinawa and Suruga Bay (Yano and Kugai 1993, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 13 November 2019). In Taiwan, it is noted that it is sometimes seen in demersal trawls but is not considered abundant (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). There are landings data on all shark species combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from the China and South Korea EEZs. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Japan, the Japanese Spurdog CPUE (numbers of sharks/100 hooks) in Okinawa waters ranged from 1.03–1.21 from 1983 to 1986 (Yano and Kugai 1993), indicating a stable population during that time. Research surveys in 2006–2012 reported a slightly higher average CPUE (numbers of sharks/100 hooks) for the Japanese Spurdog of 1.48 (Uehara <em>et al.</em> 2013), suggesting little change in the population abundance from 1983 to 2012. In Suruga Bay, the CPUE (number of sharks/trawl) of the Japanese Spurdog from 2007 to 2018 fluctuated but was relatively stable (T. Horie and S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, the landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Japan, species-specific catch rates indicate a stable population over the past 36 years (~one and half generation lengths) and fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort is decreasing and continuing to decline. Elsewhere, when the declines are scaled to three generation lengths (63 years), they represent declines of 52%, 66%, and 99% in Taiwan, China, and South Korea, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Most of the distribution of this species is in Taiwan, China, and South Korea where historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan and China may also afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (63 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Japanese Spurdog is endemic to Northwest Pacific from southeast Japan to China, including South and North Korea and Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>In Taiwan, and likely Japan and China, the larger individuals are used for human consumption and the smaller individuals are used for fish meal (H.

Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of the ~32 protected areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<a name=""_Hlk21700268""><br/><br/>In China, since </a><a name=""_Hlk21700268"">the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008).

The species is a likely bycatch of&#160;demersal trawl,  longline, and gillnet fisheries and likely retained for human consumption  and fish meal.<br/><br/>Species-specific catch rates from Japan for the sympatric Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>) infer a  relatively stable population over the past 36 years (~one and a half  generation lengths). Landings data of all sharks combined from the  Taiwan and Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all  sharks, skates, and rays from the China EEZ indicate  declines of 52–95% over the past three generation lengths (63 years).  These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative  for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.  Most of the distribution of the species is in Taiwan and China where historic and current fishing pressure is high. The inshore  trawl and gillnet  bans in Taiwan and China, respectively, may afford  the species some  refuge from fishing pressure. In Japan, where the  population appears  stable, fishing pressure and demersal trawl effort is  decreasing and  continuing to decline. It is suspected that the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog has  undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past  three generation lengths  (63 years) due to levels of exploitation, and  it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is demersal on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 40–342 m (Weigmann 2016, Viana and de Carvalho 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 57.8 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~40 cm TL and females mature at ~36 cm TL (Viana and de Carvalho 2020). The one individual reported from Peter the Great Bay, Russia was 98 cm TL (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). Reproduction is viviparous and size-at-birth ~20 cm TL (Viana and de Carvalho 2020) but nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, the Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 19.3 years and a maximum age of 22 years, resulting in a generation length of 21 years (Siao 2010).  The Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is smaller than the Japanese Spurdog (59 cm vs 105 cm TL) however, another closely related species, the Shortnose Spurdog (<em>Squalus megalops</em>) at 64 cm TL is of a more similar size to the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog, and it has a generation length of 22 years (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2006, Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rigby <em>et al. </em>2016). Hence, an inferred generation length of 21 years for the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is reasonable.","<p>The Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is subject to fishing  pressure across its range. Based on the sympatric Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>), it is likely taken as bycatch by demersal trawl,  longline, and possibly gillnet, and retained (H. Ho pers. comm. 28/08/2019). These gears operate across most of the species' depth range, with  the exception of China where trawls operate to a maximum depth of 300 m  (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019).   </p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk21698750"">In  Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the  1950s–1980s, however they  began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a  reduction in fish prices  and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical  mile Exclusive Economic  Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White  Paper 2015). </a><a name=""_Hlk22647605"">The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em>   2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a  slight  decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ   declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt  2003,  Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019a). </a><a name=""_Hlk21701990""></a><a name=""_Hlk21701973""></a>Demersal  trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three   decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant   decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the   fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry   (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The   trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial   and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand   for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than  that of  neighboring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019a, Helgil  2019a).</p><p>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small  mesh sizes,  and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks,  and a  reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing  down’  effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally  (Heileman  and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch  now  consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are  still  retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang  and Pauly 2017). The  northern South China Sea has been heavily  over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the  inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s  (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than  70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and  Liang 2019). </p><p>In  China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since  the  1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net  fisheries  during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and  Pauly 2017).  The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China  from ~10,000 in  the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with  an increase in  vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989,  the catch-per-unit  effort of fish stocks across China has steadily  decreased and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small,  less valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in  aquaculture  (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal  product for  aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China  contributing  62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019b, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). In  response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government   introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been   modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized   trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear   regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing   vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However,   non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort  continues  to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to  declining  inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013,  FAO  2019b, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is  high  and increasing, with China among the largest consumers of seafood  products  globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish  consumption was  evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were  considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters  within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The  fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s  until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The  number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased  from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at  15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and  Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries  Statistics pers. comm. 27/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has  steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239  from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to  12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 27/08/2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is  suspected to  continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish  consumption similar  to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014,  Helgil 2019b). Fish  too small for human consumption are in demand for  processing into fish  meal feed for the aquaculture industry that  produces double the  quantity of seafood taken from wild capture  fisheries in Taiwan waters  (NDC 2016).<a name=""_Hlk21696013""> </a>The fishery on the east coast, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper waters over the past 30 years (from 1998 to 2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert pers. comm. 27/08/2019). During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 27/08/2019). The move to deeper waters for most of the year, beyond most of the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog's depth range, may have reduced the fishing pressure on the species in that area over the past 30 years (1.5 generation lengths), though prior to the shift, fishing pressure on the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is suspected to have been high.<br/></p>  <p>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). </p>","<p>In Japan, this species is considered rare, but misidentification issues have created confusion about <em>Squalus </em>species catches (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is reported as commonly landed in east and south Taiwan but taxonomic confusion has also created uncertainty about the species landings data (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Despite the uncertainty in <em>Squalus</em> species identification in catches and landings, the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog spatial and depth range is known, and it is sympatric with the Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>). It is thus exposed to the same threats as the Japanese Spurdog and can be inferred to have undergone a similar population decline over the past three generation lengths (63 years).<br/></p>  <p>In  Japan, the Japanese Spurdog catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) (numbers of sharks/100 hooks) in  Okinawa waters ranged from 0.03–1.21 from 1983 to 1986 across five areas (Yano and Kugai  1993). Research surveys  in 2006–2012 reported a slightly higher average CPUE (numbers of  sharks/100 hooks) for the Japanese Spurdog of 1.47 (Uehara <em>et al.</em>  2013), suggesting little change in the population abundance from 1983 to 2012. In Suruga Bay, the CPUE (number of sharks/trawl) of the  Japanese Spurdog from 2007 to 2018 fluctuated but was relatively stable (T.  Horie and S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). </p>  In Taiwan, landings data is available on all combined shark species from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can   be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased   while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953 to 2015<a name=""_Hlk22720982""></a> (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019,  H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 27/08/2019). The  annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in  1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao<em> et al.</em>  2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 27/08/2019).  Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has  increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline  after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and  artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can  be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the  declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to  any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.  <p>In  China, reconstructed catches  of sharks, rays, and skates are available from the EEZ and showed a 67% decline over 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly  2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s  to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased  substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts  by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in  response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to demersal  trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China,  anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays  captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 27/08/2019), which reflects the broader trend  across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a  result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing  that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>  </p><p>In the Philippines, landings data of all combined shark species during 1976–2006 decreased by 72% over 21 years from 1986 to 2006. The annual landings rose from 4,900 t in 1976 to a peak of 9,800 t in 1986, then declined steadily to 2,770 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). These declines in landings of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014). </p>  <p></p>   In Japan, species-specific catch rates for the Japanese Spurdog inferred for the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog indicate a stable population  over the past 36 years (~one and a half generation lengths) and fishing  pressure and bottom trawl effort is decreasing and continuing to  decline. Elsewhere, when the declines of combined shark species and all sharks, skates, and rays are scaled to three generation  lengths of the Japanese Shortnose Spurdog (63 years), they represent declines of 52%, 66%, and 95% in  Taiwan, China, and Philippines, respectively. These levels of declines  are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the  broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. A large proportion of this species range is in Taiwan and China where  historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’)  is high. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan and China may afford the  species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is suspected that  the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past  three generation lengths (63 years).",Decreasing,"The Japanese Shortnose Spurdog is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific Ocean where it occurs in the East and South China Seas off southern Japan, China, Taiwan, and in the Panay Islands, Philippines (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, Motomura<em> et al. </em>2017, Viana and de Carvalho 2020). One specimen was reported from east of Peter the Great Bay, Russia with the species also reported from the western Yellow Sea, South Korea (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019, C-H Jeong unpubl. data 2019); these records requires verification due to potential <em>Squalus</em> misidentifications.","<p>Based on the sympatric Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>), in Taiwan, and likely Japan and China, the larger individuals are used for human consumption and the smaller individuals are used for fish meal (H. Ho pers. comm. 27/08/2019). <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. <a name=""_Hlk21700268"">In Japan,  management measures have been  implemented since the mid-1990s to  control fishing effort that include  total allowable catches, seasonal  closures, and gear restrictions (White  Paper 2015). </a>In Taiwan,  there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine  nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all  demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the  coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered  Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the  mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five  counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm  of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and  troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This  species may be protected in some of the ~32 protected areas which cover  ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with  no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the  territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><a name=""_Hlk21700268"">In China, since </a><a name=""_Hlk21700268"">the  late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing  closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East and South China  Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure  times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now  commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal  closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears  (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and  reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries  (J. Zhang pers. comm. 27/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal  closure has strengthened (X.

It is a mainly inshore continental shelf species that occurs in coastal areas from the surface to depths of 50 m. The Shortfin Devilray has a low reproductive output with one pup born, possibly every 1–3 years, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity and be incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devilray (<em>Mobula&#160;</em>spp.) fisheries worldwide.&#160;The Shortfin Devilray is a large component of targeted fisheries in Indonesia and Pakistan, and was previously targeted in the Philippines. This species is also a bycatch component of many small and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated and reported as&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;spp. The lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that populations are declining worldwide. Notable declines in landings of 93% over 14 years have been documented at one fishing landing site in Indonesia, while at another site, the species was caught in low numbers in 2001–05 but was not recorded in 2013–14. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the past three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. Based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Shortfin Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020–2058) due to ongoing demand for high-value products, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd+3d.</p>","<p>The Shortfin Devilray is an inshore, mainly shelf species found in continental coastal areas to 50 m deep (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). The species distribution does not extend into the epipelagic zone. It reaches a maximum size of 135 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~115 cm DW and females are mature by 116 cm DW (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stevens<em> et al</em>. 2018). Reproduction is viviparous with an unknown gestation period and generally producing a single large pup of 31–34 cm DW (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other <em>Mobula </em>species have a resting period of 1–3 years between pregnancies (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018) and this may also be true for the Shortfin Devilray. Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown; they are inferred from the only <em>Mobula</em> spp. with age parameters, the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>), that has an estimated age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pardo&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, note that the Giant Devilray reaches a considerably larger size than the Bentfin Devilray (520 vs 135 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.</p>","<p><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB""><span lang=""en-GB"">Mobulid rays, including the Shortfin Devilray, are targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2012, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine fisheries and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). Devilrays are often easy to target because of their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate or predictably use specific habitats, and their general lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012). The species’ preference for coastal waters places it within the range of inshore fisheries, which are known to be intensive in many parts of its range, including Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere (de Young 2006,&#160;Flewelling&#160;and&#160;Hosch&#160;2006).&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>  <p>Some of the largest documented targeted artisanal fisheries for mobulids, including the Shortfin Devilray, have been in India, Indonesia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan (Courturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In some regions, directed artisanal fisheries can land hundreds of Shortfin Devilrays per annum (that may include the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, <em>M. eregoodo</em><em>o</em>) (Alava&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Dewar 2002, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2018). While many artisanal fisheries have grown into trade fisheries, some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006a, Fernando and Stevens 2011). Mobulids, including the Shortfin Devilray, are caught incidentally as bycatch throughout their ranges in small- and large-scale fisheries (Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Despite being unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically kept because of their high trade value and even when discarded alive they are often injured and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016, Francis and Jones 2017).&#160;</p>  <p>Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and dozens of national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;</p>  <p>Global landings of mobulid species, including the Shortfin Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Acebes and Tull 2016). Between 2000 and 2007, total reported landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes and from 2008–2014 had an average landings of 4,462 t per annum, according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009, Oakes and Sant 2019); reported landings are likely to represent only a fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Almost all (99%) of mobulid gill plates are destined for the markets of Guangzhou, China, with these products sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). The source locations for the largest product volumes are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Demand has driven up the price of these products in recent decades as well as the volume of product being traded. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid gill plates moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). <br/></p>  <p>In the Indian Ocean, specifically India, intensive gillnet fisheries take mobulid species, including the Shortfin Devilray, along the eastern and western coasts (Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015, Nair <em>et al. </em>2015). Devilrays in this region are also taken as bycatch in pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries targeting swordfish (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011), and in the tuna purse seine fishery (Lezama-Ochoa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) but effort trends for these fisheries are unknown. In Pakistan, Shortfin Devilray represented 27% of the mobulids landed by number in tuna gillnet fisheries (Nawaz and Khan 2015).<strong> </strong>In the Saudi Red Sea, only one specimen of this species was recorded during extensive landing site surveys (Spaet and Berumen 2015). In Oman and United Arab Emirates, devilrays, likely including Shortfin Devilray, are often caught incidentally using beach seines (FAO 2008, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data).</p>  <p>In Indonesia, catches of the Shortfin Devilray have been recorded in the country’s two largest devilray landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok and Cilacap, West Java) (Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). In the Bohol Sea, Philippines, mobulid rays have been targeted for over a hundred years, however fleet modernization and the introduction of nets have allowed fishers to hunt these rays further afield and target a wider range of species (Alava<em> et al. </em>2002, Acebes and Tull 2016). Interviews with fishers indicate villages historically took as many as 1,000 devilrays per year (Alava <em>et al. </em>2002, Acebes and Tull 2016). </p>  <p>In the Western and Central Pacific from 2010–2015, observed bycatch of mobulids (excluding Giant Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>)) in purse seine fisheries was 4,324 individuals, and in longline fisheries was 410 individuals. Shortfin Devilray is likely among these catches, and  although none were reported, the majority of catches were reported as <em>Mobula</em> spp., hence many were not identified to species (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). <br/></p>    <p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other pollution and contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) (Essumang 2010, Ooi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Stewart&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;Furthermore, shallow water lagoon systems have been identified as important nursery habitats of other mobulids. The effects of habitat destruction and degradation and pollution in these systems may negatively impact the survival of juvenile Shortfin Devilrays (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Some localized population data for the Shortfin Devilray are available. Globally, genus-wide declines are suspected based on a combination of declining sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) data from monitored populations, catch landings data, and evidence of depletions (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hall and Roman 2013, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013,&#160;Lewis<em> et al</em>. 2015, Croll<em> et al.</em> 2016, Rohner <em>et al. </em>2017). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Many of the rates of decline are inferred or suspected, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits. <br/></p>  In Indian waters, population reductions are inferred based on general declines in devilray catches. Despite increasing effort in several regions, including Kerala (Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), along the Chennai and Tuticorin coasts (Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), and Mumbai (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009), catches indicate depletion of stocks. Trawlers in Mumbai reported maximum landings of 6.3 t for '<em>M. diabolus</em>'&#160;(an invalid, perhaps generalized name for devilrays) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years when fishing effort almost doubled, from which local population declines can be inferred. Off Sri Lanka, population reductions are strongly suspected because fishers reported declines in devilray catches over the last ~15 years with a steady increase in fishing pressure (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011).&#160;  <p>In Indonesian waters, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula</em> spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor; and, Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Shortfin Devilray declined by 93% in Tanjung Luar, and by 100% in Cilacap (that is, the species was not recorded in 2014) (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from these landed catch declines and a concurrent increase in the number of operating fishing vessels. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Shortfin Devilray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with these fisheries either collapsing or fishers switching to new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away from ports (Dewar 2002, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;</p>In Philippines waters, mobulids have been targeted for over a hundred years in the Bohol Sea. The number of villages and fishers participating in the fishery expanded at least through to 2002; however, this expansion in effort was concurrent with steep declines in catch rates, leading to inferred localized depletions (Alava<em> et al</em>. 2002). Despite on-going generalized declines in the landings of mobulid rays, fishing continued in this region, albeit on a much smaller scale (Acebes and Tull 2016). In 2017, all targeted <em>Mobula</em> fisheries in the Bohol Seas were banned, yet <em>Mobula </em>species may still be taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries in the Bohol Sea (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).<strong></strong> <br/><p></p><p>Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, and specifically at major known aggregation areas for the Shortfin Devilray, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99%<strong> </strong>over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are also in decline. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Shortfin Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020–2058) due to ongoing demand for high-value products.</p>",Decreasing,"The Shortfin Devilray has an Indo-West Pacific distribution from South Africa to the Solomon Islands (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Chin <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;As presently known, the distribution is patchy, but it is most likely more wide-ranging than current confirmed records suggest.","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>The Shortfin Devilray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates. The meat from mobulid rays, including the Shortfin Devilray, is often used locally or traded regionally for human consumption, animal feed, and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ender and Fernando 2014, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The gill plates in particular fetch high prices in Asia and are used for Chinese health tonics (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017).</p>",Marine,"<p><a name=""_Hlk2848366"">The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for elasmobranchs, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. </a></p>    <p><a name=""_Hlk2848373"">The Shortfin Devilray was listed on Appendix I and II of CMS in 2014, reflecting Parties’ commitments to strictly protect the species and work regionally toward conservation, respectively.

This latest measure still allows retention and donation for domestic human consumption of any <em>Mobula</em> species unintentionally captured and landed by purse seine vessels. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) adopted a ban on retention of <em>Mobula</em> species in 2019 with guidelines for safe release; artisanal fisheries are exempted from this ban but only for accidental catches and until 2022.</a></p>    <p>On national and local scales, 'Manta' rays tend to be subject to more protections than devilrays.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters and occurs from the surface to a depth of 60 m. The Roughnose Cowtail Ray has an inferred generation length of 20 years. Its meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and its skin is used for leather products. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although reconstructed landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–98% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). It is threatened by the extensive loss of mangroves and degradation of inshore habitats across its range. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in population declines. It is suspected that the Roughnose Cowtail Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.</p>","The Roughnose Cowtail Ray is demersal inshore on continental shelf and near estuaries from the surface to a depth of 30 m depth (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 72 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 36–39 cm DW and females mature at 50–60 cm DW (White&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Weigmann 2016, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with histotrophy and size-at-birth is ~20 cm DW (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). One pregnant female observed contained one pup (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;As there is no information on this species' maximum age and maturity, generation length was inferred as 20 years based on data for the similarly sized Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen 2007).","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Roughnose Cowtail Ray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).&#160;Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical mile (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Habitat destruction and pollution (chemical) through aquaculture (specifically conversion of mangrove habitat into shrimp farms), mining, and coastal development is a major threat to this species. This species is known to be associated with mangrove habitat in very shallow water (M. Manjaji pers. obs. 18/05/2007) and is therefore considered highly vulnerable to destruction of this habitat. Extensive areas of mangrove forest have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through conversion of land for shrimp farms (Malaysia, East Java, Sulawesi, and Sumatra), excessive logging, urban development (Malaysia) and, to a lesser extent, conversion of land to agriculture or salt pans (Java and Sulawesi) (FAO 2007). Indonesia lost about 1,300,000 hectares of mangroves from 1980–2005 (&gt;30% of mangrove area in 1980) and Malaysia lost about 110,000 hectares during the same period (&gt;16% of mangrove area in 1980) (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). This represents a loss of &gt;30% of combined overall mangrove area in Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition to loss of mangrove forests, extensive habitat degradation through destructive fishing practices and pollution has also impacted this species' shallow water habitat.</p>","<p>There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;This species, while not a whipray, is caught in similar gears, depths, and habitats as whiprays, thus whipray landing trends can be used to infer population trends of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray. .&#160;</p><p>There are three lines of evidence throughout its distribution in  Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch  reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray (60 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 88–98%.</p><p>There are two lines of evidence throughout its distribution in Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for central Indonesia and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Secondly, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per- unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Roughnose Cowtail Ray in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 tonnes reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years, or 99% when scaled to three generation lengths (60 years) (Krajangdara 2019). There is a large amount of illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing (IUU) in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Roughnose Cowtail Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (60 years).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Roughnose Cowtail Ray occurs in the Western Central Pacific Ocean around Borneo, throughout Malaysia, and in parts of Indonesia and Thailand (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Krajangdara 2019, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).","The flesh of the Roughnose Cowtail Ray is used fresh or salted, dried, and/or smoked for human consumption throughout its range (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).

In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.

It is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 100 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial fishing gears including demersal trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet and is retained for the valued meat for human consumption. <br/><br/>Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 30–90% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of shark declines in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Japanese Topeshark. It is a valued species that was targeted in the past. Once common, it is now reported as rare in parts of Taiwan, China, and South Korea, yet stable over the past 15 years in one part of Japan where trawl fishing pressure has declined over the past three decades. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Japanese Topeshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Japanese Topeshark is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 100 m  (Weigmann 2016). It possibly occurs deeper with 17 specimens reported at depths of 315–730 m (Yano and Kugai 1993 in Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 120 cm total length (TL), males mature at 85 cm TL and females mature at 80 cm TL (Ebert <em>et  al.</em> 2013a, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous with  litter sizes of 8–22 (average 10), an annual reproductive cycle, and  size-at-birth of 20 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a).&#160;Female age-at-maturity  is 4–6 years, and maximum age is &gt;15 years (Yamada 1986, Tanaka <em>et al. </em>1978); generation length is therefore estimated as 10 years.","<p>The Japanese Topeshark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It was previously targeted and is now taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption. Small mesh sizes are used in nets throughout this species' range. This species is a more popular bycatch in Japan since the near–disappearance of  the more desired Starspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>) from southern Japan over the last two decades. Throughout its  range, the Japanese Topeshark is not distinguished from the Starspotted  Smoothhound or the Spotless Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus griseus</em>) in catch or landings, confounding catch and trade data. </p>  <p></p><p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of  the Japanese Topeshark. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation  levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in  fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the  ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979–2014 is one of the highest estimated  globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the  catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but  are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and  Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense  trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The  northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).  </p><p>In China,  inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s,  following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the  preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The  number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the  late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in  vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit  effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture  (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletion,  the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and  1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort,  including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual  closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel  buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing  effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in  response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em>  2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China  is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood  products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish  consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p>In  Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to  the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to  11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National  Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The artisanal  fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered  sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts  (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the  demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption  similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014,  Helgil 2019a).&#160;</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the  1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a  reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical  mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White  Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by  approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.  </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight  decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined  slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et  al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased  markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline,  mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and  vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger  people entering the industry (NMFT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed  to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high;  at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of  neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). </p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic  levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea  and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land  reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all  intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal  habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the  East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic  reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of  mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has  also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of  significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009,  Heileman 2009).</a></p>","<p>There are no species-specific time-series available. In Japan, for the past 20 years the species has been caught sporadically in  surveys around the Nagasaki Prefecture (southwest Japan) (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). In Suruga Bay (southeast Japan), it is still  caught regularly in low numbers in set net surveys at 50 m depth, with  catch increasing slightly between 1993–2007 (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). This species was considered abundant in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b) but is now rarely seen at fish markets, and similarly, is rarely seen at fish markets in South Korea. In China, sharks of this size are now very rarely seen in fish markets (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), and this species is likely very  rare, if present at all, in China.</p><p>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from  coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone  (EEZ) (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of  abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where  landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or  increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species  combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982"">–</a>2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of  32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has  increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline  after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and  artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can  be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the  declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to  any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.</p>  <p>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a>  Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a  98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually  in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010–2014. Some of the  decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline  is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there  has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates  in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t  annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China,  fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues  to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s  to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries  resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019).  Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size  of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), which  reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish  being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a  consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of  the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In South Korea, the  reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks,  rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969–2014. There were minimal  catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a  peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about  one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>   When these  reconstructed catch declines are scaled to three generation  lengths of the Japanese Topeshark (30 years) they  represent declines of  30%, 88%, 40%, and 90% in Taiwan, Japan, China,  and South Korea,  respectively. These levels of declines are not  species-specific but are  informative for understanding the broader  levels of decline in sharks  in the region. Fishing pressure  (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the  entire spatial and  depth range of the Japanese Topeshark. The species is a valued bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial  fisheries which operate with small trawl and net mesh sizes, and have  been intensive for a considerable time. Once common, it is now reported as rare in Taiwan, China, and South  Korea yet stable and slightly increasing in catches over 15 years in one  part of Japan. The low age-at-maturity, annual reproductive cycle, and  moderate sized litters may provide some resilience to fishing pressure.  The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may  afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, across its range, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).",Decreasing,"The Japanese Topeshark is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean where it occurs in southern Japan, Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and China (Ebert<em> et al. </em>2013a, Nakabo 2013). Previous records from Indonesia have since been identified as Indonesian Houndshark (<em>H. indroyonoi</em>) and from New Caledonia as possibly Darksnout Houndshark (<em>H. abdita</em>) (White <em>et al.</em> 2009).","The Japanese Topeshark is valued for its meat (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The meat is flash boiled  in Japan and sold as ubiki with mid-range market value in areas of  southern Japan, and possibly dried for human  consumption in the Nagasaki Prefecture, southwest Japan (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The meat is of similar value in markets in Korea (C-H.  Jeong unpubl. data 2019) and Taiwan (H. Ho pers. comm. 28/08/2019) and sold for human  consumption (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Although sharks of this size are now very rarely seen in fish  markets throughout China (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019), this species  (along with any caught in multi-species fisheries) is retained for its meat. The Japanese Topeshark was used for fish paste or fish cake in the  1990s, but this is no longer a viable use as the catch is now so low (A.  Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). It is likely that the fins, although small, enter the fin trade (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2019).",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s,  regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on  commercial bottom trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the  South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year  round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied  over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are  in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to  also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and  longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow  small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang  pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has  strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The effectiveness of the closures  is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and  Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China  coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in  Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;</p>  <p>In Taiwan, there is a  prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in  68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling  is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm  for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency  2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned  within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal  of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government  assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency  2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally  attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency  2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). This species may be protected in some  of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and  ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas  accounting for accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas,  respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).  In  Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to  control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal  closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 60 m. Whiprays larger than 80 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Round Whipray has an inferred generation length of 20 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). In Thailand, ray landings have decreased by 78% in 8 years, a significant decrease in less than one generation length. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Round Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>The Round Whipray is demersal inshore in coastal embayments and estuaries to depths of 60 m (A.

Reproduction is presumably viviparous, with histotrophy, like others of this genus (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Fecundity is thought to be one pup per litter (Manjaji 2004). Little else is known of its biology.&#160;Generation length was suspected to be 19 years based on similar species Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) which has a slightly smaller maximum size at 80 cm disc width (DW) (Jacobsen 2007).</p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Round Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al. </em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).

There is also intensive gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and trawl and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al. </em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters, before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em> et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi<em> et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p></p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 tonnes per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths, this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5% (60 years).</p><p>Two lines of evidence throughout its range within Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Central Indonesia and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Round Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths.</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019). When scaled to three generation lengths, this decrease is equivalent to 100%.&#160;</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There is limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray species catch rates declined more than for shark species.&#160;Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. Surveys on coral reefs in the southern portion of Myanmar in 2013 and 2014 recorded no shark species, and only a handful of <em>Neotrygo</em>n sp., during 143 dives (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;</span></p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Round Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Round Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (60 years).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Round Whipray occurs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean from Myanmar to Java, Indonesia (Last <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). It is possibly extant in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (A.B. Haque and D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).","Round Whipray is frequently landed throughout Southeast Asia and the meat is used fresh or salted and dried for human consumption throughout its range (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;This species is landed in the markets in Singapore, which come from the waters of Indonesia and Malaysia (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat, but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Meat is sometimes processed into fishmeal / animal feed when excess is landed.&#160;<p></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where t<span class=""tlid-translation""><span lang=""EN"">he Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing operations (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al. </em>2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></p>","",,false,false,Global
124503842,161543,Paragaleus tengi,Endangered,A2d,2020,2020-05-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Straight-tooth Weasel Shark (<em>Paragaleus tengi</em>) is a small (to 93 cm total length) shark endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans from Japan to Malaysia including China, Taiwan, Viet Nam, and Thailand. It is demersal in shallow, inshore waters with a restricted depth range of 0–20 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. There are no species-specific time series. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan, China, and Viet Nam EEZs infer declines of 26–96% over the past three generation lengths (26 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is very high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark. Its restricted inshore distribution means it has no refuge from intense fishing pressure and is possibly now  extinct in Taiwan. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may  afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. The inferred<a name=""_Hlk22807790""> relatively short generation length may provide it some resilience to fishing pressure. Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region are likely </a>a threat to this species. It is suspected that the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","<p>The Straight-tooth Weasel Shark is demersal in inshore waters to a depth of 20 m (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a known maximum size of 93 cm total length (TL), males mature at 78–88 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, White and Harris 2013). Only four whole adult males were available for the species redescription with the occurrence in Penang, Malaysia based on three sets of jaws collected from Penang and verified as the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark (White and Harris 2013). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a).  Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown and there is no such data  from a congener, but it is available from a member of the same family,  the Snaggletooth Shark (<em>Hemipristis elongata</em>) with an age-at-maturity of 2.5 years and maximum age of 14.7 years (Last and Stevens 2009, Smart <em>et al.</em>  2013), resulting in a generation length of 8.6 years. However, the  Snaggletooth Shark reaches a considerably larger size than the  Straight-tooth Weasel Shark (240 cm vs 93 cm TL) and therefore this  generation length is likely overestimated.</p>","The Straight-tooth Weasel Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption or fish meal. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<a name=""_Hlk22884618""><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011).</a> The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 1/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 1 /09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in inshore fisheries that operate at depths of 5–20 m and use bottom longline, divers and traps (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020).   Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al. </em>2017).<a name=""_Hlk22807790""><br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson et al. 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995). </a>","There are no species-specific time-series available. This species is very rare in Taiwan and with no specimens recorded from Taiwan in the last few decades it is possibly now extinct in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b, White and Harris 2013). It is considered rare in Viet Nam (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and for the Thailand EEZ (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, Krajangdara 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>The landings data from the Gulf of Thailand showed a 96% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 9,005 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~400 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan and China EEZs based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). <br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark (26 years) they represent declines of 26%, 84%, 36%, and 96% in Taiwan, Japan, China, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. A population trend cannot be inferred for the Gulf of Thailand and has not been inferred for Malaysia as the occurrence there is currently only based on a few sets of jaws. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark. The species has no refuge from fishing pressure and is possibly now extinct in Taiwan. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. The likely relatively short generation length may provide it some resilience to fishing pressure. Overall, across its range, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years).",Decreasing,"The Straight-tooth Weasel Shark is endemic to the Northwest, Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans from Japan to Malaysia (Penang), including southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Viet Nam, and Thailand (Gulf of Thailand) (Compagno 1988, 1998; Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a; White and Harris 2013). Records of this species in the Andaman Sea, Thailand (Krajangdara 2019) require further verification.","<p>No species-specific information is available on use and trade; it is likely used for its meat and fins (White <em>et al.</em> 2006.

In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao et al. 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which  cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas,  with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and  4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020).   In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch levels should be monitored.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>  <p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 40 m. Whiprays larger than 80 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Tubemouth Whipray has an inferred generation length of 20 years. The meat is considered good quality and is consumed locally. There is a long history of overfishing inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) indicate declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (60 years). Its habitat has also been negatively impacted by urban development and agriculture. This species has no refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Tubemouth Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>","<p>The Tubemouth Whipray is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to 40 m (Manjaji-Matsumoto and Last 2006, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 100 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 49 cm DW, females mature at 70 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 19 cm DW (Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is likely viviparous, little else is known of its biology. There is no information on this species' maximum age and  age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred as ~25 years  based on data for&#160;Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacobsen  and Bennett 2011). The Blackspotted Whipray has a smaller maximum  size (80 cm DW) than the Tubemouth Whipray (100 cm DW), therefore  generation length was scaled to be 25 years rather than 20 years.</p><p></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Tubemouth Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al. </em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. Data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al. </em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Tubemouth Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 tonnes reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Tubemouth Whipray.

There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020).

This species is captured by industrial trawl and gillnet fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries. Rhinobatids are known to be susceptible to population depletion as a result of their limiting life-history characteristics and they are often targeted for the high value of their fins. Heavy artisanal fishing pressure occurs throughout the majority of this species' range, and it has been noted that guitarfishes have decreased in size due to fishing pressure in Madagascar. There may be some recovery occurring in South Africa given that fishing effort in the inshore trawl fishery has been limited since 2007. Overall, due to heavy and increasing fishing pressure, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 50% over the past three generations (15 years). Therefore, the Greyspot Guitarfish is assessed as Endangered A2d. Research is required on life-history, abundance, interaction with fisheries, and population trends.","The Greyspot Guitarfish is a benthic shark-like ray found inshore to a depth of 100 m. This species reaches a maximum size of 120 cm total length (TL) and reaches maturity at 56 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). This species is viviparous and young are born at 25 cm TL (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Age and growth data are not available for this species, but generation length is likely similar to that of the closely-related and similarly-sized Lesser Guitarfish (<em>Acroteriobatus annulatus</em>) at five years (van der Elst 1981, Rossouw 1984).","The Greyspot Guitarfish is caught in trawl and gillnet fisheries across its range. Numerous fisheries including net and inshore trawl fisheries operate off South Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Tanzania. There are some published data on shark catches within the industrialized or semi-industrialized fisheries of Mozambique (AMAR/EOTH 2007). For example, the prawn trawling industry produced a large bycatch of demersal sharks and rays, with approximately 1,500 metric tons of elasmobranch fishes caught as a prawn fishery bycatch in 1994 (AMAR/EOTH 2007). Guitarfishes<em></em> have been the main elasmobranch group caught in this fishery (AMAR/EOTH 2007). Turtle excluder devices (TEDs), which have been shown to reduce bycatch of elasmobranchs, are required to be used in Mozambique, Madagascar, and Kenyan prawn trawl fisheries; however, in practice TEDs are not used in Mozambique (Fennessy <em>et al.</em> 2007). In South Africa, the Greyspot Guitarfish has been recorded in prawn trawl fisheries (Fennessy 1994), however, the inshore shrimp trawl fishery has been limited in the number of vessels and the level of effort since 2007 (Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI), unpubl. data, 2018).<br/><br/>Guitarfishes have been recorded in artisanal fisheries in southern Mozambique (Pierce <em>et al.</em> 2008), Madagascar (Humber <em>et al. </em>2017), and Tanzania including Zanzibar (Barrowclift <em>et al. </em>2017). They are taken in artisanal fisheries and are particularly valued for their fins, which fetch high prices in the shark fin trade (Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015). The mean maximum length of guitarfishes in Madagascar declined by nearly half over a 6-year period from 2007–2012, although it is not clear how much of this catch is made up of the Greyspot Guitarfish (Humber <em>et al.</em> 2017). Guitarfishes are also heavily targeted in Zanzibar (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). <em></em><em></em>","There are no population size estimates for the Greyspot Guitarfish. This coastal species is subjected to heavy and increasing fishing pressure through the majority of its range. Inshore artisanal fishing is intense in Mozambique, Madagascar, and Tanzania including Zanzibar. Surveys of fishers in Zanzibar show that most considered shark and ray numbers to have decreased on their fishing grounds, concomitant with an increase in the sale value (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). In addition, shallow-water shrimp trawling occurs in Mozambique, Madagascar, and to a lesser extent South Africa. Although this species may have some degree of refuge from fishing pressure in South Africa, it is suspected that the Greyspot Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of at least 50% over the past three generations (15 years) due to the levels of exploitation across most of its range.",Decreasing,"The Greyspot Guitarfish occurs in the Western Indian Ocean off the coasts of Madagascar and East Africa from the Eastern Cape, South Africa to Tanzania and Zanzibar (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b, R.

It inhabits shallow coastal inshore and coral reef habitats at the restricted depths of 0–12 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption. Reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 36–99% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) of the Indonesian Bambooshark. Further, a population reduction of 39% was inferred for the Indonesian Bambooshark based on a 50% decrease in fisheries-independent research survey catch rate of elasmobranchs (all species combined) between 1978–80 and 2013 in Myanmar. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline of elasmobranchs in the region.&#160;Fishing pressure is high across the entire spatial and depth range of this species. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region, which may be in response to the overfishing of large sharks resulting in meso-predator release of the Indonesian Bambooshark. Alternatively, the increase in landings may imply some resilience to fishing pressure. There has been extensive loss and degradation of coastal mangroves and inshore coral reefs habitats across its range over the past three generation lengths (24 years) with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 in Southeast Asia. The lack of refuge from fishing pressure for this inshore species with the shallow depth range is of concern.<em> </em>It is suspected that the Indonesian Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in quality of habitat and is therefore assessed as Endangered A2cd.</p>","<p>The Indonesian Bambooshark occurs in shallow inshore habitats including intertidal pools, rocky and coral reefs, and sandy and muddy habitats from the surface to depths of 12 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).

The artisanal fishing fleet in Bangladesh operates at depths of 0–40 m on average but can operate down to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 t in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In Myanmar, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Andaman Sea, there has been a shift to smaller, fast-growing, and productive sharks where <em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp. comprise 65% of the landings in the Ranong province of Thailand (Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). A 165% increase in fishers occurred from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise a high majority (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). The Indonesian Bambooshark is one of the most commonly landed sharks by number and weight in fisheries landings in Malaysia (SEAFDEC 2016). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Indonesian Bamboshark. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-orientated economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;</p><p>It is suspected that this species is targeted for the aquarium trade. There is one online market that offers live individuals for&#160;USD $88 that are labelled&#160;<em>Chiloscyllium hasseltii&#160;</em>(Marine World 2020).</p><p>Habitat destruction and degradation is a key threat to this inshore species. Reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;In Viet Nam, large areas of the coast are used for shrimp aquaculture, which caused the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). In Viet Nam, dynamite and&#160;cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, FAO 2020). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to&#160;1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific trend information for the Indonesian Bambooshark. Monitoring of fish landing sites in Southeast Asia have shown that the relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades due to declines in large sharks and increased targeting and retention of the remaining smaller species (Lam and&#160;Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Lack and Sant 2012, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.&#160;</p><p>In Bangladesh, reconstructed catch data showed a 34% decline in landings over 15 years from 2000 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 195 t in 1950 to 7,540 t in 1973 the declined to the 3,500 t in the mid 1980s, then rose steeply to a peak of 10,909 t in 2000 followed by a fluctuating decline to 7,163 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in catch can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Myanmar, reconstructed shark and ray catch, from 1950 to the late 1990s, varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 tonnes with no substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 catch increased to around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This infers there has been no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014). Trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs over the 33 years between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013 and a shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species (Krakstad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Market surveys reveal a decline in landings of 49% over a four-year period (2006–2010) despite no reduction in fishing effort and increasing domination by small, short-lived species (San San Khine 2010).</p><p>In Malaysia, monitoring of fish landing sites has shown that the relative proportion of bamboosharks (<em>Chiloscyllium </em>spp.) in landings has doubled over recent years (Arshad <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Lack and Sant 2012, SEAFDEC 2016).&#160;Overall catch of sharks and rays declined by 30% on the east coast of Malaysia between 1999 and 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Similarly, on the west coast of Malaysia, shark and ray catch declined by 18% over the same period. These declines can be inferred to represent population reductions, as fishing effort was increasing during the period of declines (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In the Gulf of Thailand, catches of sharks, rays, and skates showed a 74% decline over 12 years from 2003 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Historically, catches fluctuated since 1950–1998 at 5,000–13,000 t then rose steeply to a peak catch of 20,340 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 5,380 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the steep decline in catches from 2003 to 2014 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.</p><p>In Cambodia, this species has not been recorded in recent decades (L. Seyha unpubl. data 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 93% reduction decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catch remained fairly steady from 1950 to 1993 then increased to a peak catch of 1,694 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catch to 121 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines of sharks and ray catch can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of decline (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Viet Nam, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates declined by 97% over 29 years from 1986 to 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in catch (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p>In Indonesia, net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially in the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Indonesian Bambooshark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). This species is uncommon compared to other bamboosharks in the area (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). When these reconstructed catch declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Indonesian Bambooshark (24 years) they represent declines of 51%, 36%, 99%, and 95% in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Viet Nam, respectively. In Myanmar, a population reduction of 39% was inferred based on a 50% reduction in research survey catch rate of bulk elasmobranchs between surveys in 1978–80 and 2013. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The relative proportion of bamboosharks in shark landings has increased significantly over recent decades in the region and this species may have benefited from meso-predator release due to the overfishing of large sharks. Overall, given the restricted inshore distribution that incurs a complete spatial overlap with fisheries and lack of any refuge from fishing activity, it is suspected that the Indonesian Bambooshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (24 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Indonesian Bambooshark occurs in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from St. Martin's Island, Bangladesh to Halmahera, Indonesia including Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, and Viet Nam (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Datta <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).",The species is used for its low-value meat for local consumption (SEAFDEC 2016).&#160;It is suspected that this species is targeted for the aquarium trade (Marine World 2020).,Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures currently in place. In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 02/04/2020). In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross tonnes are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 Marine Protected Areas making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). <span lang=""EN-US"">In Indonesia, trawls were banned from use in 1980, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al.</em> 1987).

It is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 60 m.<br/><br/>The species is likely taken as incidental catch in bottom trawl, longline, set net and trammel net fisheries across its range. Torpedo rays (<em>Torpedo</em>&#160;spp.) have low economic value and while retained in some countries (e.g., Senegal), they are discarded in others (e.g., Gabon). If released alive, post-release survival is likely to be high. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. In addition to artisanal fisheries in coastal areas, there are frequent incursions into these waters by distant water vessels using demersal trawl and longline gears to target demersal fish and shrimp species within the depth limit of this species.<br/><br/><span style="""">Overall, there are&#160;few data from most countries in the region,&#160;likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously&#160;occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its&#160;susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Rosette Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of&#160;</span>50–79%<span style="""">&#160;over the past three&#160;generation lengths (48 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</span>","The Rosette Torpedo is demersal on sandy and muddy substrates in shallow coastal waters from inshore to a depth of 60 m (Last&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL) and little else is known about its life history. Reproduction is likely lecithotrophic viviparous, like other torpedo rays. There is no information on this species'  age-at-maturity and maximum age, hence, generation length is inferred based on data for the Marbled Torpedo (<em>Torpedo marmorata</em>) that has an age-at-maturity of 12 years and a maximum age of 20 years and, thus, a generation length of 16 years (Mellinger 1971). However, this should be used with caution, as it is noted that the Rosette Torpedo reaches a smaller maximum size than the Marbled Torpedo (60 cm vs 100 cm TL).","The Rosette Torpedo is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, set nets, tangle nets, and trammel nets, and is discarded or retained for human consumption. Information on post-release survival is limited, but it is suspected to be high. (Tsagarakis <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan et al. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","<p><span style=""""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span></p>There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Rosette Torpedo that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic regions (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Contemporary patterns of landings indicate that there have been limited records of this species in the past decade from across the Eastern Central Atlantic region. The pattern of retention and discarding of torpedo rays varies between countries across this region and therefore species occurrence or absence in landings need to be carefully considered at the national scale. The Rosette Torpedo was rarely recorded in The Gambia and Senegal during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region between 2004 and 2011 while other species of torpedo rays were recorded in Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Sierra Leone (Diop and Dossa 2011). It was also not recorded in the fisheries monitoring program by the Centre de Recherche Océographique Dakar-Thiaroye (CRODT) between 1985 and 1988 (Mar 2008). In The Gambia, one individual was recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 despite other species of rays with similar catchability being present in large quantities (Moore et al. 2019). The individual was found discarded dead on the beach. It has also not been detected in recent surveys in Guinea-Bissau (Bijagos Archipelago); in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019; in Nigerian research surveys (although likely to be retained there despite its low economic value); in Cameroon in over two years of landing site surveys (although often discarded there); in the Republic of the Congo from surveys between January and December 2019 (although if caught it would likely be directly processed for fish meal especially in industrial fisheries); and from Angola during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018, although fishers were able to identify torpedo rays during interviews (P. Doherty, G.H.L. Leurs, K. Metcalfe, A.L. Soares, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). However, one individual was recorded through a citizen science project working with local fishers in Cameroon (A. Takoukam pers. comm. 14 July 2020). In Western Ghana, based on landing site surveys in 2019 and 2020, torpedo rays represented 9% of ray landings (7% were identified as the Common Torpedo Ray (<em>Torpedo torpedo</em>) while 2% were likely a mix of the West African Torpedo (<em>Torpedo mackayana</em>) and the Rosette Torpedo) (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). All torpedo rays there are landed for local consumption or for utilization as chicken feed. In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, torpedo rays are frequently captured but discarded alive, and they are also recorded in artisanal fisheries landings operating in Mayumba using demersal-set gillnets and are also usually discarded (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Despite being morphologically distinct and easy to identify, this species was not listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" surveys in 2004 (Congo, Gabon, and Angola), 2006 (Nigeria, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon and Congo), 2007 (Angola), 2008 (Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Togo, Cameroon, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, and Congo), and 2010 (Gabon and Congo) (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2006, Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mehl <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, other torpedo rays with similar catchability (e.g., the Marbled Torpedo Ray and the Common Torpedo Ray) were captured in up to 18.9% of trawl hauls in surveys between Guinea and Morocco (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark fishing countries of Nigeria and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. The greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% over 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings have increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970 to 2015. Average elasmobranch landings in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 44% reduction in elasmobranch CPUE from 0.107 t/kW in 1981–1983 to 0.060 t/kW in 2013–2015.<br/><br/>Overall, there are few data from most countries in the region, likely reflecting a high level of discards in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. However, populations may also have already been reduced prior to recent work in the area. Considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in trawl surveys and fisheries in several localities where it previously occurred, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in rays in general across its range, it is suspected that the Rosette Torpedo has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (48 years) due to actual or potential levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""></span>",Decreasing,"The Rosette Torpedo is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Senegal to Angola (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).

Chartrain unpubl. data 2020), or are used for human consumption (fresh or dried and smoked) and animal feed (Diop and Dossa 2011, I. Seidu and A. B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). The Rosette Torpedo&#160;may&#160;be used for fish oil production in the future (Ayas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across its range have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Rosette Torpedo are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It is found inshore on the continental shelf in depths of less than 50 m. The species is caught in a variety of fishing gear including demersal trawl, gillnet, hook and line, stake net, and dol (bag nets) and is retained for human consumption. It was once known to be common, but it has declined drastically in the past two decades in India and is now rarely encountered in all other range states. Catches declined by an order of a magnitude in just over a decade between 2003–2004 to 2016 between Gujarat and Mumbai. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Reconstructed catches of mainly carcharhinids for the western and northern Indian Ocean infer declines of 67% when scaled to three generation lengths (20 years). It is suspected that Broadfin Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (20 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Broadfin Shark occurs inshore on the continental shelf in depths of less than 50 m (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016, Weigmann 2016). It attains a maximum size of 178 cm total length (TL),&#160; males mature at ~137 cm TL and females are suspected to mature ~143 cm TL (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of typically 4–8 pups (usually 6), a gestation length of eight months and size-at-birth of 42–65 cm TL (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016). The generation length is suspected to be around 6.5 years, similar to that of the Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) which is a similar-sized species from the same family (Lessa <em>et al</em>. 2000).","There is little information on catches of the Broadfin Shark as species-specific data are not usually recorded. The species is taken in a variety of gear including bottom trawls, gillnets, hook and line, stake net, and dol (bag net) fisheries (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007, Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016). Around 30% of landings from dol nets and trawlers are juveniles (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 9 February 2017). The high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In the Indian state of Gujarat for example, the number of trawlers increased from about 6,600 in the early 2000s to 11,582 in 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). All Indian states have high numbers of trawlers (e.g. Maharashtra, 5,613 trawlers; Kerala, 3,678 trawlers, Tamil Nadu, 5,767 trawlers; total trawlers in India: 35,228 as reported in 2010) and a high number of gillnetters (total of 20,257 as reported in 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species is also likely threatened by habitat removal and destruction (e.g., inshore mangrove areas) which is prolific throughout much of its range. As this species predominantly occurs inshore, pollution from river outflow is also a possible threat.","The Broadfin Shark is a rare and poorly known species. Reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). The Broadfin Shark is particularly vulnerable to trawl fisheries and there are indications of increasing effort along the western coast of India (See Threats section). It is considered rare throughout most of its Indian range and rarely observed or reported from commercial fish catches along the Indian coast, except from the northwest of India (Maharashtra region) where it was once considered to be common (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016). Most of the available records are from Mumbai, India; it was once known to be common in this area, but it has drastically declined in the past two decades (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005, Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2003–2004, landings of 513 t of this species were reported from Gujarat to Mumbai (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2007). Evidence of declines in catches of this species are now reported with catches reaching 82 t in Mumbai in 2016 (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 9 February 2017). Additionally, landing surveys from 2013 to 2014 in Gujarat and Mumbai only recorded seven specimens (D. Sutaria pers. comm. 24 April 2017).<br/><br/>In Pakistan, it used to be caught as bycatch of trawl fisheries that operated on the inner continental, however, it is now seldom caught and has almost disappeared from commercial catches (M. Khan pers. comm. 12 December 2020)&#160; This species was historically present in Bangladesh, but only 14 specimens have been collected in recent landings surveys; they were captured in large mesh gillnets at 40–75 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). While there is limited information available on this species in the region, it is rarely encountered despite ongoing research efforts. Its large size and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that, like many other large carcharhinids in the region, it is likely to have declined.<br/><br/>Reconstructed catches of related species are available at the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale, i.e., Carcharhinidae, <em>Carcharhinus </em>spp., Hardnose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus macloti</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus sorrah</em>), Tawny Nurse Shark (<em>Nebrius ferrugineus</em>), and Triakidae (Pauly <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The aggregate catch of these closely related species are available for the western and northern Indian Ocean and Red Sea (Large Marine Ecosystems 31–34), ranging from Tanzania to Thailand (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Reconstructed catches rose rapidly since the 1960s peaking at a catch of 90,984 t in 1974. Since then, catches have declined by 58 over 42 years (1974–2016), with a very steep decline in catch of 48% over 12 years (2004–2016). This is equivalent to a population reduction of 67% when scaled to three generation lengths (20 years) of the Broadfin Shark. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>This species has declined drastically in parts of its range over the three generation lengths (20 years) and is now rare where it was once common and carcharhinids have declined by 67% over the past three generation lengths (20 years). It is suspected that Broadfin Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (20 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Broadfin Shark occurs in the northern Indian Ocean where it ranges from Pakistan to Thailand (White <em>et al</em>. 2010, Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2016, Psomadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, the easternmost distribution boundary is uncertain, not least due to the occurrence of the sister species, the Borneo Broadfin Shark (<em>L. tephrodes</em>) found further east (White <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species has not been recorded on the species list of Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). There are two records of the Broadfin Shark from extensive landings surveys at Tanjung Luar (East Lombok), Indonesia in 2016, one reportedly captured in West Nusa Tenggara waters (around Belongas Bay area in West Lombok) another caught in East Nusa Tenggara waters (H. Booth pers. comm. 23 August 2020).","The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets across the region. In Pakistan and India, the meat is cut into fillets, dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries. The fins are dried and traded internationally (Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. India and Pakistan have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. longlining) to which they are susceptible.

It is a primarily inshore species; the maximum depth is unknown but it is probably less than 200 m. The species is a bycatch of multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet,&#160;and seine nets, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. It was considered common in China prior to the 2000s and landings data based on reconstructed catches of all sharks, rays, and skates from the China and South Korea Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 46%&#160;and 92%, respectively over the past three generation lengths (36 years). The Chinese Stingray population decline in China may be higher than the estimated 46% for all batoids, as the Chinese Stingray was previously common in China but is now infrequently observed. Historic and current fishing pressure is very high across the species’ entire range, with dramatic levels of habitat loss across its range also likely a threat to the species. It is inferred that the Chinese Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Chinese Stingray is demersal on the continental shelf, primarily inshore and probably at depths of 0–200 m, although no specific information is available on its maximum depth (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016b).

Reproduction is viviparous (Last et <em>al. </em>2016b), but nothing else is known of its biology. Ages are inferred from the related and similar-sized maskray complex (<em>Neotrygon </em>spp.) that has a verified female age-at-maturity of 6.5 years and a maximum age of 17 years, resulting in a generation length of 12 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010; as '<em>Neotrygon kuhlii</em>').","<p>The Chinese Stingray is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including trawl, and probably set net and gillnet, and is retained for human consumption and fish meal (Zhu and Meng 2001).<br/><br/>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Chinese Stingray. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly-valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China being one the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>The demand for seafood in South Korea is very high at 53.5 kg per capita in 2013, compared to that in China of 33.1 kg per capita in 2010 (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b). Most of the fisheries catch in South Korea is used for human consumption (FAO 2019b).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s and 65% loss of tidal flats (one type of intertidal habitat) since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al. </em>2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009).</a></p>","<p>In China, this species is infrequently observed (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). It was previously noted as commonly captured off China (Zhu and Meng 2001). Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for China and South Korea EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. <br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline, in landings over 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Chinese Stingray (36 years), they represent declines of 46% and 92% in China and South Korea, respectively.

In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009).</p>","The Chinese Fanray is now considered rare in China and is only observed seasonally (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). There is no specific effort information from Viet Nam but as the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).   <p>The reconstructed catch data showed a 67% and 88% decline in landings in China and Viet Nam, respectively (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller-sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, there were minimal catches from 1950 to 1980 that then rose steeply during the mid-1980s to a peak of 1,515 t in 1990 followed by a steady decline to 182 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>This represents 46% and 96% declines in China and Viet Nam, respectively when scaled to three generation lengths (36 years) of the Chinese Fanray. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The Chinese Fanray has a very restricted distribution and historical and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is very high across its entire spatial and depth range. The species has no refuge from fishing pressure and is considered rare in China. The inshore trawl seasonal closures in China may afford the species some temporary refuge. Overall, across its range, the species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (36 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Chinese Fanray is endemic to the Northwest Pacific from central China to northern Viet Nam (Iwatsuki <em>et al. </em>2011, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).",This species is used for human consumption with smaller individuals used for fish meal (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).,Marine,"<p>Since the late 1990s, Chinese regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>It is possible that some of this species' habitat is within marine protected areas. There are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in protected areas (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012).&#160;</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
124516589,161621,Himantura undulata,Endangered,A2d,2020,2020-05-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Honeycomb Whipray (<em>Himantura undulata</em>) is a medium-sized (to 130 cm disc width (DW)) ray that is widespread in the Indo-Pacific region from east India to the Philippines. It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 70 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Honeycomb Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally. This species is specifically targeted for their skins, which are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing inshore ray populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). In Thailand, ray landings have decreased 78% in 8 years, and in the Philippines, landings decreased by 76% in 16 years. These are significant decreases in less than one generation length. Overfishing of inshore habitats is evident throughout its range such that it is now considered rare in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, Viet Nam, and Sri Lanka. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure, which is high and increasing across its range, resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Honeycomb Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>The Honeycomb Whipray is demersal inshore on soft substrates on continental and insular shelves to a depth of 70 m (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 130 cm disc width (DW), males mature between 60–70 cm DW and size-at-birth&#160;is 26–27 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (Last <em>et al. </em>2010). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length was based on the congener, the Blackspotted Whipray (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maculabatis astra</span>). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The maximum size of the Honeycomb Whipray is considerably larger (~130 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted Whipray (80 cm DW), thus it is suspected the generation length of Honeycomb Whipray is 25 years.</p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Honeycomb Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking human population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008). This species, in particular, is targeted in some areas of Indonesia for their large size and value of their skins (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</span></p><p>The Honeycomb Whipray has been landed in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and trawl and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In the Philippines, the Honeycomb Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b).</p><p>The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast demersal trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>The Honeycomb Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2020).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of its fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased by nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al. </em>2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The Honeycomb Whipray is particularly targeted with unbaited longline hooks and is desirable because of its size (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Føyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fibreglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).<span class=""tlid-translation""></p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length). About 6,600 trawlers were operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em></span><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands there is a targeted fishery for rays that began two years ago and consists of 20–40 boats and catch up to 6 tonnes of rays per trip. Honeycomb Whiprays contribute 15–20% of the catch (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>There is a large amount of IUU in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Taiwan, indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). There has been an estimated 10-20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>","<p>There are no population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. <br/></p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017) This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991 to 2006.</p><p>Four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>The catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, the catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 tin 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Honeycomb Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>In Viet Nam, there is a lack of species-specific data, however, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam EEZ, based on landings data (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p><p>In Cambodia this species is now considered rare, which may be indicative of historic depletions (S. Li unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inferences on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species. Research trawl surveys in Myanmar by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al. </em>2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” resulting in many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake and Sigurdsson 2005).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas, IUU catch of sharks were estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al. </em>2010).</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Honeycomb Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Honeycomb Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).<br/></p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Honeycomb Whipray occurs in the Indo-West Pacific Oceans from eastern India to the Philippines (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, J.

Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p><br/></p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance are limited (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020).&#160;In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K.

Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.</p><p>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T.

It is demersal on the continental shelves and slopes at depths of 5–725 m. It is captured in demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. Like many skates, this species has a slow life history, particularly in the part of its Canadian range where it matures at 13 years and has a generation length of 17 years. In the USA, it is a major component of the skate wing fishery, taken as bycatch of demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries. In Canada, it is a discarded bycatch (mandated by legislation) of demersal trawl, longline, and net fisheries.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Historically, this species underwent very steep declines coinciding with high levels of demersal fishing from international fleets targeting shelf and slope groundfish.&#160;The extension of Exclusive Economic Zones out to 200 nautical miles in 1977 restricted fishing access to USA and Canadian vessels.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">Effort was renewed on skates in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the encouragement of directed fisheries as other groundfish fisheries collapsed in USA and Canadian waters and as international demand for skate wings increased. In the southern part of its USA range, the annual population growth rate is increasing at a rate of 2% per year and the stock is sustainably fished, assessments revealed that the stock is not being overfished and that overfishing is not occurring. In stark contrast, there have been very steep reductions in Canadian waters, of 98.2%, 98.3% and 90.6%, in the southern NW Atlantic (Northeastern USA, Georges Banks, Canada/Gulf of Maine, USA (5Z), Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy, Canada (4VWX) and Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (4T), respectively. The directed commercial skate fishery on the Grand Banks and Scotian Shelf was closed in 2004 and all Winter Skate were to be discarded, and discard rates were to be monitored. Predation from recovering populations of Grey Seal (<em>Halichoerus grypus</em>) is estimated to have caused high levels of adult mortality in the Gulf of St Lawrence and which may be inhibiting recovery there.&#160;Overall, the combination of very steep estimated population reduction in the bulk of this species' distribution in Canada is partially offset by the sustainably managed and increasing fraction of the species range in USA waters, and it is estimated that this skate has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (51 years). Therefore, the Winter Skate is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span>","The Winter Skate is demersal on the continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 5–725 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 113 cm total length (TL); females mature at 65–77 cm TL and males at 53–58 cm TL (Simon and Frank 2000). Reproduction is oviparous with females producing 18–36 eggs per year and size-at-hatch of 11–13 cm TL (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). There are considerable differences in life history between the warmer southern part of this species distribution and larger size-at-maturity and later age-at-maturity further north. Female age-at-maturity is 5 years and maximum age is 11 years in Gulf of Maine (Kelly and Hanson 2013); further north, female age-at-maturity is 13 years and maximum age is 19 years on the Scotian Shelf (McPhie and Campana 2009).&#160;Outside the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Winter Skate mature at 75 cm total length and at 13 years. Within the Gulf, they mature at 42 cm and at 5 years. Generation time is estimated to be 17 years outside the Gulf and 10 years in the Gulf&#160;(COSEWIC 2015).","<p>The Winter Skate is captured in demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. <br/><br/>Historically, the USA skate complex (comprising seven species) has been reported in New England fishery landings since the late 1800s. However, commercial fishery landings never exceeded several hundred metric tons until the advent of distant-water fleets during the 1960s (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2003). Skate landings (of all species combined) reached 9,500 mt in 1969, but declined quickly during the 1970s, falling to 800 mt in 1981 (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160; <br/><br/>Most skates were discarded between 1983–2002 in the USA, but the increasing value of skate wings and demand for lobster bait in recent years has resulted in increased retention and landings, with discard rates declining from 90% to 40% over time and landings having increased from 883 to 16,283 t per year in 2014 (Curtis and Sosebee 2015).&#160;Overall fishing effort in the region’s trawl and gillnet fisheries declined during the 2000s due to changing groundfish regulations (Curtis and Sosebee 2015).<br/><br/>The Skate Wing fishery was promoted in the 1990s in different parts of the USA and Canada&#160;in response to declining abundance of traditional groundfish species. Across its range, Winter Skate was incidentally captured in groundfish trawl and gillnet fisheries targeting mainly Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>), flounders (Pleuronectidae), and monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp.), as well as scallops (in the USA) (Packer 2003, Curtis and Sosebee 2015). The larger species captured, including&#160;Winter Skate,&#160;Thorny Skate (<em>Amblyraja radiata</em>), and Barndoor Skate (<em>Dipturus laevis</em>),&#160;had their wings removed ('winged') for local consumption and international trade, with Winter and Thorny Skate preferred (Curtis and Sosebee 2015).&#160;The average estimated catch of Winter Skate in the USA has been 8,911 ± 1,977 t per year between 2005–2012 (Curtis and Sosebee 2015). There is also some bycatch in the New England Scallop fishery which has the second highest discard rates after the groundfish trawl fishery. The post-release mortality from scallop dredging was very low, estimated to be 45.6% (Knotek <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>Historically in the northwest Atlantic,<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;skates were taken as incidental catch of groundfish fisheries with high fishing effort, particularly distant water fleets on Georges&#160;Bank and Scotian Shelf, Grand Banks and Labrador Shelf in the 1960s and 1970s. The extension of the USA and Canadian 200-mile exclusive economic zones in 1977 excluded vessels from other&#160;<a>countries</a><span lang=""EN-US"">.&#160;The steep decline of the Winter Skate abundance in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence is coincident with an increase in landings in the 1970s and 1980s (COSEWIC 2015). Discards in the Gulf initially exceeded 1,000,000 individuals in the 1970s, declining to 500,000–700,000 in the 1980s and 1990s but are now a small fraction, &lt; 10,000 fish/year in recent years (Swain <em>et al. </em>2006, 2016;<em>&#160;</em>COSEWIC 2015). While this species has been heavily overfished historically in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence, it appears now that&#160;species is near local extinction&#160;and&#160;seal predation poses the most significant impediment to recovery&#160;(Swain <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>In Canada, a targeted skate fishery, mainly for Thorny and Winter Skate, was initiated on the Grand Banks and Scotian Shelf,&#160;in 1994, following the closure of groundfish fisheries (as a result of Atlantic Cod&#160;<em>Gadus morhua</em>&#160;overfishing) and a rise in international demand for skate wings (Kulka and Mowbury 1999). This target fishery was closed in 2004 as a result of a rapid population decline. Winter Skate continues to be taken in bycatch, but is not permitted to be retained in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries in this area.&#160;In Canada, based on estimates of landings, discards, and post-discard survival rates, maximum estimated exploitation rates during the 1970 to 2015 period in Division 4VW were 4% for small juveniles, 11% for large juveniles, and 17% for adults. Exploitation rates in 2011 to 2015 were 1.3% for small juveniles, 0.6% for large juveniles, and 0.41% for adults.<br/><br/>Groundfishes, including skates, have been heavily fished historically in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence. The low abundance of prey species has meant that Grey Seal (<em>Halichoerus grypus)&#160;</em>predation poses a significant source of mortality on adult classes of skate, including Smooth Skate (Swain <em>et al.</em> 2009).</span></p><p></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">There are no data available on the absolute global population size of Winter Skate.&#160;Population trend data were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;Population trend data are available from five sources:<br/><br/>(1) CPUE data from the USA NEFSC Fall survey (1967–2018), (2) Georges Banks, Canada/Gulf of Maine, USA (5Z) relative abundance index (mature individuals) for 1987–2018, (3) Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy (4VWX) survey index of abundance (mature individuals) for 1970–2017, and (4) Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (4T) survey index of abundance (mature individuals) for 1971–2018.<br/><br/>First, the trend analysis of the NEFSC Fall survey 1967–2018 (51 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 303% over three generation lengths (51 years), with the highest probability (100%) of population increase over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the trend analysis of the Georges Bank, Canada/Gulf of Maine, USA (5Z) relative abundance index (mature individuals) for 1987–2018 (31 years) revealed annual rates of decrease of 7.43% consistent with an estimated median decline of 98.3% over three generation lengths (51 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Third, the trend analysis of the Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy (4VWX) survey index of abundance (mature individuals) for 1970–2017 (47 years) revealed annual rates of decrease of 7.3% consistent with an estimated median decline of 98.2% over three generation lengths (51 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">Fourth, the trend analysis of the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence (4T) survey index of abundance (mature individuals) for 1971–2018 (47 years) revealed annual rates of decrease of 7.66% consistent with an estimated median decline of 90.6% over three generation lengths (30 years in the Gulf of St. Lawrence), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fifth, this species is projected to become locally extinct from the Gulf of St. Lawrence by the middle of this century (Swain <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;This portion of the population is geographically separated from other parts of its distribution with little or no chance of rescue from other areas.

Further south in the USA (and western Scotian Shelf, in Canada), this species is increasing, albeit with some considerable variability, consistent with an assessment of Least Concern. Taken together, the overall abundance index suggests an increase in abundance from the mid-1960s until the later 1980s followed by a steep decline until 1995 and a lesser but continuing decline to the present day. The overall annual rate of decrease of 1.85% is consistent with an estimated median decline of 63.7% over three generation lengths (51 years), with the highest probability (57%) of 50–79% reduction and a small probability (14%) of population reduction greater than 80% (Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>Overall, given the available trend data, it is suspected that the Winter Skate has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (51 years).&#160;</span></p><span lang=""EN-US""></span>",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">The Winter Skate occurs in the Northwest Atlantic from North Carolina, USA to Labrador, Canada (COSEWIC 2005, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;It has disjunct concentrations in the Gulf of St Lawrence, the southern Grand Banks/Northeast Scotian Shelf, and southwest Scotian Shelf/all areas south.

It is also known from Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean. It is demersal on the continental shelf from intertidal waters to a depth of 360 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet, and is retained for human consumption, fish meal, and liver oil. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan and the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from Japan, China, South Korea, Viet Nam, and Borneo EEZs indicate declines of 32–98% over the past three generation lengths (33 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound. It is a valued species that was targeted in the past. Once common, it is now reported as rare in most of Taiwan and has disappeared from southern Japan. It is also considered currently rare in Viet Nam and Borneo. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Starspotted Smooth-hound has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","<p>The Starspotted Smooth-hound is demersal from intertidal waters to a depth of 360 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 135 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). The species exhibits geographical variation in reproductive parameters with northern populations growing to a larger size and living for a longer period (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>1998, 2000). Males mature at 55–92 cm TL and females mature at 60–97 cm TL (Taniuchi <em>et al</em>. 1983, Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2000). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of  1–22 (average of 5), an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of  20–35 cm TL (Yamaguchi <em>et al. </em>1997, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 3–7 years and maximum age is 17 years; generation length is therefore 11 years (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2000).</p>","<p>The Starspotted Smooth-hound is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It was previously targeted and is now taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. Trawls and longline operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption, fish meal and liver oil. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Bottom trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in offshore industrial demersal trawl and longline fisheries that operate at depths of 50–150 m (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al. </em>2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Kenya, fishing pressure has increased substantially from ~2000 fishers in 1950 to 13,100 in 2013 (FAO 2015, Le Manach<em> et al. </em>2015). Artisanal and industrial fisheries capture sharks at all life-stages (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 24/4/2018). <br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995).</a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a></p>","There are no species-specific time-series available. Once a common commercial species in Taiwan, the population has declined drastically over the last few decades due to fishing and it is now rare except in northern Taiwan (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2001, Lee 2003, H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). It has disappeared from southern Japan over the last two decades but is still present in northern Japan; the dramatic decline in the south could be due to a combination of fishing pressure and climate change with a notable increase in the water temperature in southern Japan waters (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The species is not common in China (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). It is considered rare in Viet Nam and in Borneo, it has rarely been captured over the past 10 years (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020, V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is no information on the population trend of this species in Kenya.<br/><br/>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan and Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) (NFRDI 2017, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data in Taiwan showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2015 (Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort. In the Philippines, landings data of all combined shark species during  1976–2006 decreased by 72% over 21 years from 1986 to 2006. The annual  landings rose from 4,900 t in 1976 to a peak of 9,800 t in 1986, then  declined steadily to 2,770 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). These declines in  landings of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of  the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2014 have been reconstructed for Japan, China, South Korea, Viet Nam, and Borneo EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Reconstructed landings of shark (carcharhinid) in Sabah slowly increased  from the 1950s to the late 1980s before steeply increasing to 14,800 t  in 1995 and then decreasing by 34% to 9,400 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). In Sarawak, reconstructed landings of shark (carcharhinid)  increased throughout the 1950s and sharply increased in the early 1970s  to over 7,000 tonnes; they then decreased to 4–5,000 tonnes throughout  the 1980s before increasing to 7,400 tonnes again in 1997 and then  decreasing by 66% to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).  Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus these  declines infer reductions in the populations of sharks in Borneo.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Starspotted Smooth-hound (33 years) they represent declines of 32%, 88%, 90%, 43%, 92%, 98%, 55%, and 89% in Taiwan, Philippines Japan, China, South Korea, Viet Nam, Sabah, and Sarawak, <strong></strong>respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.&#160; Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound. The species is a valued catch that was targeted in the past and is now a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial fisheries which operate with small trawl and net mesh sizes, and have been intensive for a considerable time. Once common, it is now reported as rare in most of Taiwan, it has disappeared from southern Japan and is now considered rare elsewhere. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, across its range, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (33 years).",Decreasing,"The Starspotted Smooth-hound occurs in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific Oceans from southern Russia to Borneo, including Japan, North and South Korea, China, Taiwan, Viet Nam, and the Philippines (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Motomura <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is also known from Kenya in the Western Indian Ocean (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Records from elsewhere require further confirmation: it has been recorded in the Andaman Sea, Thailand; from Madagascar and from Bangladesh (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2018, T. Krajangdara unpubl. data 2020).","The species is valued for its meat and fins (Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Japan, the meat is flash boiled and sold as ubiki with mid-range market value in areas of southern Japan (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Smaller individuals may be used for fish meal in Taiwan and China, and in the latter country, the meat is valuable and the species is also used for the liver oil (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). In Borneo, the meat it is consumed domestically and the fins are traded (Last <em>et al. </em>2010, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32 Protected Areas which  cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas,  with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and  4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).    In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices,  and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is  limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are at least three Marine  Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to  preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a). In the Philippines, active  fishing gears, including trawlers, were prohibited within municipal  marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). in 1981, there were  5-year closures of the trawl fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and  Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO  2020b). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010  to use Juvenile and Trashfish Turtle Excluder Devices under the  Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl.  data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays  (Brewer <em>et al. </em>2006). There are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected  Areas (MPAs) (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide  shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo  MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, and catches should be monitored.  <br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Little is known of its biology. The species is a bycatch of deep-water demersal crustacean trawl fisheries, and although effort has declined substantially in South Africa over the last two decades, it is ongoing in southern Mozambique. The species was commonly caught historically in fisheries and research surveys in the 1960s and 1970s, but catch levels dropped suddenly and very few records have been confirmed since. Due to historically heavy levels of fishing pressure, ongoing fishing at lower levels of effort, a lack of recent records despite research, and some possible refuge at depth,&#160;the Honeycomb Izak Catshark is suspected to have undergone a  population reduction of 50–79%  over the past three generations (45  years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Honeycomb Izak Catshark is found on the upper to mid-slope at depths of 200–740 m, but possibly to 1,000 m (Ebert 2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of at least 51.5 cm total length (TL), females mature at 42.3 cm TL and male size-at-maturity is unknown (Human 2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is likely oviparous and pairs of eggs are possibly laid year-round, based on the regional congener Izak Catshark (<em>Holohalaerus regani</em>) (Richardson<em> et al.</em> 2000). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to  age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the  similar-sized Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that  has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in an  inferred generation length of 15 years for the Honeycomb Izak Catshsark (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011).","The Honeycomb Izak Catshark is likely a bycatch of deep-water demersal  trawl fisheries. A crustacean trawl fishery operates off Durban, and extends northwards into southern Mozambique operating at depths of 100–600 m (Fennessy and Groenveld 1997). <em>Holohalaelurus</em> species from the KwaZulu-Natal and  southern Mozambique region were still present in commercial fisheries  landings as of 2008, but apparently only rarely and species identification was not being recorded (Human 2009). Effort,  however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort  level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the  early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time,  for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 24 April  2018). Other trawl fishing in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al. </em>2010, Benkenstein 2013) may threaten this species. This species has refuge in deeper waters from fishing pressure.","There are no estimates of population size or trend for the Izak Honeycomb Catshark. The species was historically regularly recorded from fishing trawls, however, besides one record from 2007 it has not been recorded since the mid-1970s (S. Fennessy and B. Everett, Oceanographic Research Institute, pers. comm., 24 April 2018). Detailed examination of datasheets collected for this species by the Oceanographic Research Institute, South Africa (ORI) indicate that this shark was not uncommon in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Research surveys in 2002 and 2003, and later in 2007 off Mozambique, have not recorded this species, yet other deep-water demersal sharks were captured (Human 2009). Catch rates for this species were stable during the late 1960s to the early 1970s (ORI datasheets), followed by an abrupt lack of occurrence in trawls. The ORI datasheets, used to refer to the previous abundance of this species, are species-specific, and include morphometric data as well as sketches and notes on the sharks' appearance. There is little doubt that these earlier records refer to the Honeycomb Izak Catshark, and are indicative of the previous abundance of this species (Human 2009). Due to historically heavy levels of fishing pressure, ongoing fishing at lower levels of effort, a lack of recent records despite research, and some possible refuge at depth, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Honeycomb Izak Catshark is a southern African endemic with a restricted distribution in the Western Indian Ocean from Durban, South Africa, to Maputo, Mozambique (Ebert 2013, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","This species has not been recorded in trade, and is not known to be utilized.",Marine,"There are currently no species-specific conservation measures in place for the Honeycomb Izak Catshark.

This species is subject to intensive target and bycatch trawl, gillnet, and set net fisheries throughout its geographic range. In the Republic of Korea, the Mottled Skate previously underwent a severe population reduction inferred from a 90% decline in catch landings over a decade,&#160;consistent with a population reduction of &gt;80 within three generation lengths (56 years). Subsequently, catch was reduced to near zero due to the imposition of Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Within a decade the species appears to have recovered sufficiently that the TAC was increased to 1,900 mt in 2013. While this managed recovery gives considerable hope, since then catch has exceeded the TAC by 122%, averaging 2,335 mt from 2013 to 2018 that could possibly result in another population collapse in the future. Furthermore, this species is subject to an intensive target fishery, for export to Korea,&#160;in the only other core part of its distribution west of Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan. There are no species-specific catch data for this species and skate landings data collection ended in 2006. Total skate catch has increased slightly in Hokkaido recent years, following a steep long-term decline in landings over the past 70 years. This recent increase is suspected to reflect increased fishing pressure rather than recovery because the international demand for skates from Korea is very high. Little is known of population catch and trajectories throughout the rest of its range but it is suspected that fishing pressure is high and there is little limit on fishing mortality on this species. Mottled Skate is one of the most expensive fishes sold in South Korea, attaining market prices of US $10-30 per kilogram because it is valued for its fermented flesh (Hongeo) which is served sliced raw and in soup in the Republic of Korea. Consequently, the Republic of Korea is the major importer of skates from around the world, driving imports from as a far away as Russia, Canada, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Europe. Due to its high value, there is considerable mislabeling of imported skate as this species. Demand for Mottled Skate is so high that the rates of mislabelling as this species among the greatest of any of seafood analysed in Korea. High commercial value, the lack of geographic and depth refuge from widespread intensive fisheries,&#160;as well as habitat degradation as a result of the fishing activities,&#160;and the lack of effective management are detrimental to this species. Taken together, severe population reduction is suspected from high value and demand, long-term steep declines in fisheries landings in Republic of Korea and Hokkaido, Japan.&#160;It is suspected that the Mottled Skate has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (56 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","<p>The Mottled Skate is demersal on the inner continental shelf at depths of 5–30 m (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It reaches a maximum size of 115 cm total length (TL), males mature at 57 cm TL and females mature at 67 cm TL (Jo <em>et al. </em>2011, Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Reproduction is oviparous with annual fecundity of about 240 eggs (range 98–556) (Yeon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997) and size-at-hatch of 9–10 cm TL (Ishiyama 1967). Generation length is suspected to be 18.5 years, based on a similar-sized relative Longnose Skate (<em>Beringraja rhina</em>). Age-at-maturity of Longnose Skate (<em>Beringraja rhina</em>) is estimated at 10–12 years for females (Zeiner and Wolf 1993, COSEWIC 2007) and maximum female age was reported at 26 years (McFarlane and King 2006).</p>","<p>Skates are targeted using trawls, longlines, and set gillnets off southern Korea. Declining skate catches have led to a decrease in target fishing in recent years, but no species-specific data are available, so it is difficult to identify which species are involved.&#160;International demand for skates in Korea is very high, driven by demand for Hongeo or Hongeohoe, fermented skate meat which is a traditional delicacy. In Japan this species is subject to a directed skate fishery around Hokkaido this fisheries continues&#160;(H. Ishihara unpubl. data 2005, 2019). Total skate catch has increased slightly in Hokkaido recent years, following a steep long-term decline in landings over past 70 years.

In South Korea, the average annual catch of this species sharply declined from 3,500 metric tons (mt) in the 1992 to 250 mt in 2001 (Jo <em>et al.</em> 2010, C.-H. Jeong unpublished data 2019), representing a greater than 90% decrease over a decade consistent with a population reduction of &gt;80% within three generation lengths (56 years). Subsequently, catch was reduced to near zero due to the of imposition of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (Fischer <em>et al.</em> 2012). Within a decade, the species appears to have recovered sufficiently that the fishery TAC was increased to 1,900 mt in 2013. Since, then the species catch has exceeded the TAC by 122%, averaging 2,335 mt from 2013 to 2018 (C.-H. Jeong unpublished data 2019). Furthermore, this species is subject to an intensive target fishery in the only other core part of its distribution west of Hokkaido, Japan. There are no species-specific catch data for this species in Japan and skate landings data collection ended in 2006 (H. Ishihara pers. comm. 2019). This species is exported to Korea, as skate value is relatively low in Japan, 200 yen per kg&#160;(USD$2) and is considerably more valuable in Korea USD $10-20 per kg. Little is known of population catch and trajectories in the Yellow Sea but the suspicion is that fishing pressure is high and there is little limit on fishing mortality on this species. It is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50-79% over the past three generation lengths (56 years).",Decreasing,"The Mottled Skate is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean from China to the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia, including Taiwan, North and South Korea, and Japan (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). The centre of abundance is around the Daecheong and Heuksando Islands, South Korea, and around Hokkaido Island, Japan (Ishiyama 1958, Jeong 1999).","<p>This skate is both a target and utilised bycatch of commercial and artisanal fisheries.

Little is known of its biology.  The species is a bycatch of deep-water demersal trawl fisheries  in  South Africa, although effort has declined substantially over the last two decades. It is  also a rare bycatch of  the Mozambique trawl and longline  fisheries. The African Spotted Catshark was commonly caught historically in fisheries and  research surveys in the 1960s and 1970s,  but catch levels have dropped and very few records have been confirmed  since. Due to historically heavy levels of fishing pressure, ongoing fishing at lower levels of effort, a lack of recent records despite research, and some possible refuge at depth,&#160;the African Spotted Catshark&#160;is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (30 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The African Spotted Catshark is found on the upper continental slope at depths of 220–420 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 34 cm total length (TL), males mature at 29 cm TL and females mature at 24 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is oviparous with pairs of eggs laid, although the reproductive periodicity is unknown (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown. Catsharks are difficult to   age and the most reliable age estimates to date are from the   Blacktip Sawtail Catshark (<em>Galeus sauteri</em>) that   has an age-at-maturity of 9 years and maximum age of 21 years, resulting in a generation length of 15 years (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Blacktip Sawtail Catshark is larger than the African Spotted Catshark (48 cm vs 34 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 10 years for the African Spotted Catshark.","The African Spotted Catshark is likely captured as bycatch by deep-water demersal trawl  fisheries. A crustacean trawl fishery operates off Durban, and extends northwards into southern Mozambique operating at depths of 100–600 m (Fennessy and Groenveld 1997).&#160;<em>Holohalaelurus</em> species from the KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique region were still present in commercial fisheries landings as of 2008, but apparently only rarely and species identification was not being recorded (Human 2009). Effort, however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time, for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 24 April 2018).  This species has been recorded rarely in both the Mozambique  deep-water trawl and longline fisheries (S. Fernando, pers. comm., 24 April 2018). Fishing pressure in  Madagascar is intense and increasing (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Cripps <em>et al. </em>2015). The species may have refuge at depth in some parts of its distribution.","There are no estimates of population size or trends for the African Spotted Catshark. This species was historically common in commercial and research bottom  trawls off KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) and southern Mozambique  coasts (Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975, Bass 1986, Human 2006). Detailed  examination of species-specific data collected by the Oceanographic  Research Institute, South Africa (ORI), indicate this species was common to abundant in  the late 1960s and early 1970s, however only two specimens have been  collected in that area since 1972, one most recently in 2014, despite several research trawl surveys (Human 2009, S.  Fennessy, pers. comm., 23 April 2018). Another single specimen was collected off Mozambique during a <em>RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen</em> survey in 2007, but other deep-water demersal sharks were more common (Human 2009). The ORI datasheets, used to refer to the previous abundance of this species, are species-specific and include morphometric data as well as sketches and notes on the sharks' appearance. There is little doubt that these earlier records refer to the African Spotted Catshark, and are indicative of the previous abundance of this species (Human 2009). Due to historically heavy levels of fishing pressure, ongoing fishing at lower levels of effort, a lack of recent records despite research, and some possible refuge at depth,&#160;this species is  suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the  past three generation lengths (30 years).",Decreasing,"The African Spotted Catshark is a southern African endemic that occurs in South Africa, Mozambique, and Madagascar in the Western Indian Ocean (Ebert 2013, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2018).

It was formerly abundant in part of Japan, but less common there now. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Japan, China, South Korea, Philippines and Borneo EEZs infer declines of 41–97% over the past three generation lengths (45 years).

It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net<em>, </em>gillnet, and torchlight net. Trawls operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. In Taiwan and Japan, and likely China, Korea and Borneo, it is retained for fish meal production for aquaculture.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since  the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries  during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly  2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from  ~10,000  in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an  increase  in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the   catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased  and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small, less  valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in  aquaculture  (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal  product for aquaculture is high, with the  aquaculture industry in China  contributing 62% of the world’s farmed  fish (FAO 2019a, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government  introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been  modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized  trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear  regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing  vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However,  non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues  to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining  inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO  2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and  increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products  globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was  evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<a name=""_Hlk22884015""><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries  were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters  within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The  fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s  until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The</a>  number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone  significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late  1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200  vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries  Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal  fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered  sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts  (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu,  Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the  total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by  longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<a name=""_Hlk22807790""> Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include  coastal habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy  metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/></a>","This species is considered common in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b), with little change in the observed abundance at landing sites over the past 10–15 years (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), although no concurrent effort data for this period is available to infer population trends. In Japan, it was formerly abundant in Tachibana Bay, Nagasaki Prefecture, but in the last few years it is less common (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). <br/><br/>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan and Philippine Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) (NFRDI 2017, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953<a name=""_Hlk22720982"">–</a>2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort. In the Philippines, landings data of all combined shark species during  1976–2006 decreased by 72% over 21 years from 1986 to 2006. The annual  landings rose from 4,900 t in 1976 to a peak of 9,800 t in 1986, then  declined steadily to 2,770 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). These declines in  landings of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of  the declines in landings (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950<a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Japan, China, South Korea, and Borneo EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sarawak, Borneo, landings of the Blackspotted Catshark are rare with  less than 5 individuals landed per year (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).  Reconstructed landings of shark (carcharhinid) in Sarawak slowly   increased from the 1950s to the late 1980s before steeply increasing to   14,800 t in 1995 and then decreasing by 34% to 9,400 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>   2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus   these declines infer reductions in the populations of sharks in Borneo.<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Blackspotted Catshark (45 years) they represent declines of 41%, 94%, 96%, 54%, 97% and 66% in Taiwan, Philippines, Japan, China, South Korea, and Borneo respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the entire range of the Blackspotted Catshark, although the observed landing rates remain stable over the past generation length in Taiwan (15 years). Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (45 years).",Decreasing,"The Blackspotted Catshark is endemic to Northwest and Western Central Pacific Oceans. In the Northwest Pacific, it is found from Japan to China, including North and South Korea and Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a). In the Western Central Pacific, it occurs in the Philippines and Sarawak, Borneo (Motomorua <em>et al. </em>2017). It possibly occurs off Thailand but its presence there requires verification (Krajangdara <em>et al.</em> 2019).","<p>The species is likely too small for human consumption. In Taiwan, the meat is low value and is used for fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In Japan, this species was formerly used for fish paste (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Borneo, the smaller individuals are used for fish meal and larger individuals used for the low value meat (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/></p>",Marine,"<p>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). There are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the  southern China provinces, although only a few are documented  internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are  reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less  than 20 km<sup>2</sup>, are reported in the World Database of Protected  Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have  recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of  the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). There are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan  coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take  areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas,  respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, active fishing gears, including trawlers, were prohibited in 1998 within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Turtle Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer<em> et al. </em>2006). There are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018). <span lang=""EN-AU"">Throughout Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Research is need on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to a depth of 50 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Coach Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. It is targeted and taken as bycatch across its range with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gill nets, and droplines, longlines and retained for the meat that is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins that are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 50–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines. It is suspected that the Coach Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Coach Whipray occurs in inshore waters from the surface to a depth of 50 m, although it prefers shallow waters (including estuarine waters and sometimes into freshwater) and is often located in intertidal lagoons, reef flats, and reef faces (Last et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 160 cm disc width (DW), males mature at ~82 cm DW and female size-at-maturity is unknown. Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy and litter size is likely two pups based on a single pregnant female, and size-at-birth is 21–28 cm DW (Last et al. 2016, B.M. Majaji-Matsumoto unpubl. data 2015). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length is inferred from a similar species, the Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) which has a generation length of 20 years (Jacobsen 2007). The Blackspotted Whipray is smaller than the Coach Whipray (80 cm vs 160 cm DW) and thus as a conservative estimation, the generation length is inferred as 25 years for the Coach Whipray.","Throughout its distribution, the Coach Whipray is taken as target and bycatch in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Stingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by Danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2008). Intensive longline and gillnetting occurs throughout the Malacca Strait, with some mini-trawl operations and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Coach Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3GT vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares et al. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004, sharks and rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard et al. 2015, Mizrahi et al. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial), and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (Ahmad 2004). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as demersal set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the southwest region of the country will go out to sea for 5–10 days and sometimes more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t per year from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast (Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).<br/><br/>In India, juvenile rays are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). There is also a recent increase in fishing pressure on large stingrays, like this species, due to increased demand for export of frozen wings to Thailand and Malaysia in the past six years (M. Khan pers. comm. 11 December 2020). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, marine fisheries catches reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999 suggesting stocks are fully fished. There is concern for serial depletion with the number of species landed near-doubling from only 85 in 1971 to 152 reported in 2000 (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). More than 60 million people reside within 100 km of the coast of the Western Indian Ocean and there is great dependence on marine resources for food and employment (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa and Madagascar (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). In contrast to many other regions of the world, where industrial fisheries with high-technical gear predominate, fishers in the Western Indian Ocean operate primarily at the subsistence and artisanal level. For example, in Tanzania, no more than 5% of fishers are active in industrial fishing, the other 95% being artisanal (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are underreported and most small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or overexploited, especially where they are found close to population centers. Over the last ten years, the number of underexploited fisheries in the coastal zone has tended to decline and such fisheries are now an exception (FAO 2006, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for estuarine and inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).","There is no population trend estimate for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, reconstructed landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort. This correlated to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t per year in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths of the Coach Whipray (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 93–99%.<br/><br/>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea that can be used to show changes in relative abundance. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean, however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber et al. 2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (less than one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Coach Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006. There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978–1980 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006–2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, questionnaires (n=200) completed by local fishers have indicated a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque, unpubl. data, 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because, “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” and many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).<br/><br/>The population has declined significantly off India and Pakistan due to intense and increasing fishing activities. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same study showed a decline of 83% in the average landings of the Coach Whipray between 1990–2004, which is equivalent to a &gt;99% decline over three generation lengths&#160; (75 years). Although the Coach Whipray is the more common species in India, identification is problematic, and species-specific data is not considered reliable (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 21 March 2017), and landings would also include Leopard Whipray (Himantura leoparda). In Pakistan, the populations of both local Himantura species have declined by ~50% since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 25 March 2017), the equivalent of an ~95% decline over three generation lengths (75 years) of the Coach Whipray.<br/><br/>These declines are in contrast to other parts of its range, particularly the Arabian/Persian Gulf, where the species is commonly recorded and regularly discarded (and so do not always occur in fish markets), so significant declines are unlikely there. This species is likely present in low numbers in Iranian waters of the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Catches of rays in general in these waters have been around 5,000-6,000 t between 2013 and 2015. Research trawl surveys in the area have indicated an overall increase in the biomass of rays (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valinassab 2016). <br/><br/>Targeted and unmanaged fisheries for whiprays in Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar, are likely to be leading to population reduction. Surveys of fishers in Zanzibar show that most considered shark and ray numbers in general to have decreased on their fishing grounds, concomitant with an increase in the sale value of meat (Jiddawi and Shehe 1999). An ecological risk assessment identified whiptail stingrays as susceptible to southwest Indian Ocean small-scale fisheries (A. Temple pers. comm. 28 July 2018).<br/><br/>Actual levels of exploitation are high across most of the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Coach Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Coach Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Coach Whipray is widespread in the Indo-Pacific in the Eastern and Western Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from South Africa to the Philippines (Last<em>&#160;et al. </em>2016b). The species is a Lessepsian immigrant, having entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal and is present in Egypt and Israel and may extend north to Syria (Serena 2005, Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Serena <em>et al. </em>2020).","The meat is used for human consumption. Throughout the Southeast Asian portion of its range, the meat is consumed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. In Indonesia and Malaysia, the meat is considered good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is occasionally landed at the markets in Singapore and sold to local grocery stores (N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 6 May 2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat, but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand of ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and some anecdotal information suggests in restaurants as well (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Oman, this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan pers. comm. 28 May 2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of large rays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In India, ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price.",Marine,"No species-specific measures are in place. Throughout Indonesia there are 196 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) making up 239,428 km2 and in Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² (CTI 2020). Although the specie may occur in these MPAs, most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles (nm) from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010 (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer et al. 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 MPAs (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray et al. 2018).<br/><br/>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage (GT) are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman have banned trawling in their waters while Iran, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have commercial trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with regulations specifically banning catches of rays.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is also likely taken in industrial fisheries operating trawls in coastal areas.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al</em>. 2017, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>) from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin and the African Wedgefish (<em>Rhynchobatus luebberti</em>) from the Sine-Saloum Delta) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fernandez-Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan <em>et al</em>. 2012, CCLME 2016, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels operating in this region by 2010 (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers most the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel <em>et al</em>. 2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).<br/><br/>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural run-off, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016). In West Africa, mangroves are harvested for fuel wood, construction timber, and charcoal with an overall mangrove forest area decline of up to 70% in some countries over the last 20 years with the highest loses recorded from Côte d'Ivoire (67%), Liberia (65%), Guinea (60%), Sierra Leone (40%), and Ghana (30%) (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2016, CCLME 2016).","There are no species-specific time-series data available for the Atlantic Weasel Shark that can be used to estimate population reduction. Despite the lack of species-specific data, there are a number of relevant historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch rates, and although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In nearly all cases presented below, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to rise globally, with high increases in the Eastern Central Atlantic region (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Belhabib <em>et al</em>. 2018, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>First, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, both overall catch and effort have continued to rise in the major shark and ray fishing countries of Mauritania, Nigeria, and Ghana, and consequently population reduction cannot be inferred from these increasing trends, but this does indicate rising fishing pressure. Since the 1970s, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t), and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker et al. 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall, across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% between 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW by 2015 (Pauly et al. 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch landings were 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015, an increase by more than 2.5 times (Pauly et al. 2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch landings volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased. Within countries, landings have historically increased but have peaked and begun to decline in recent years. More specifically, in Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed a decline of at least 30%, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Landings gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981 (80% decline), then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch landings then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Nigeria, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010–2016. Historically, landings quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Second, comparisons of historic abundance with contemporary patterns is consistent with population declines even though the Atlantic Weasel Shark still occurs in landings across the Eastern Central Atlantic. In Mauritania, in the 1990s, this species was a significant bycatch (a large proportion of which were pregnant females) of a fishery targeting sciaenids (<em>Argyrosomus regius </em>and <em>Pseudotholithus </em>spp.) using demersal set gillnets by the traditional Imraguen fishers in the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). It was also one of the five most abundant species of elasmobranchs recorded during monthly surveys undertaken in this park between 1998–2002 (Valadou <em>et al</em>. 2006). While species-specific information is not available, anecdotal evidence indicates that this species was historically very abundant but that targeted fisheries led to severe declines in quantities landed. The species is also captured as bycatch in a targeted fisheries for 'tollo' generally consisting of the Common Smoothhood (<em>Mustelus mustelus</em>) and the Barbeled Houndshark (<em>Leptocharias smithii</em>). Indeed, by the mid-2000s, landings of this species within the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin had significantly declined to the point where it was infrequently reported in landings statistics (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2020). Annual fisheries statistics from the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et de Pêches for surveys in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin, collected since 2009, indicate that landings fluctuate between 1 t (in 2013) and 42 t (peak in 2018) (M. Dia unpubl. data 2020). Furthermore, data from experimental trawl fishing surveys in the Parc National du Banc D'Arguin indicate a decrease in catch-per-unit effort that is the equivalent of &gt;90% population reduction over the last three generation lengths of the Atlantic Weasel Shark (39 years). <br/><br/>Between 2004–2011, this species was recorded during extensive landing site surveys across the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission region in all countries except for Sierra Leone but was not considered abundant (Diop and Dossa 2011, M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). However, it has now become increasingly rare across the region (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). In The Gambia, this species was not recorded during landing site surveys conducted annually between 2010 and 2018 although other species of sharks were also infrequently recorded (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Cape Verde, the species was recorded during Baited Remote Underwater Video Surveys undertaken between 2015–2017 with almost 40 individuals sighted in 220 hours of underwater video footage (S. Pires, S. Ratao unpubl. data 2020). The species is frequently caught in artisanal fisheries across the archipelago but landings quantities are not available because data are aggregated with other species such as the Common Smoothhound, Barbeled Houndshark, and the Milk Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon acutus</em>). There, it is targeted for cação (dried shark meat) which has replaced imported cod from Portugal and has resulted in increased targeted shark fisheries (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2018). There has been no recent records of this species in landing site surveys in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau (G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020). It was recorded in trawl surveys undertaken in Guinea from 1985–2012 but data on quantities are not available (Camara <em>et al</em>. 2016). This species was considered very rare in landings from drifting gillnets in Côte d’Ivoire (Abidjan Port) between 1991–2003 (N'Goran <em>et al</em>. 2005). More recently, there have been no records of this species in Côte d'Ivoire during landing site surveys in 2019 (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020). Similarly, it was not recorded in landing sites surveys in Western Ghana in 2019 and 2020 despite other species of sharks with similar catchability like the Common Smoothhound being recorded (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). This species was listed in cruise reports from the ""Dr. Fridtjof Nansen"" trawl surveys with up to four individuals representing 13.56% of catches in one haul from Nigeria in 2004 and two individuals representing 4.88% of catches captured between Gabon and Congo (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2004, Krakstad et al. 2008). In Nigeria, it was recorded in small quantities in national trawl research surveys in 2009 (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In the trawl fisheries observer data from Gabon, this species represented 3% of sharks captured in 2017 and 8.6% in 2018 and while these were mostly discarded alive they were wounded and in a poor state likely increasing post-release mortality. The Atlantic Weasel Shark, Common Smoothhound, and Barbeled Houndshark together represent an important proportion of shark captures reported by onboard observers with 17.1% in 2016, 28.6% in 2017, 50.4% in 2018 and 34.8% in 2019, with variations in catches over the years likely due to differences in the presence of onboard observers and spatial regulations in process (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). Records of Atlantic Weasel Shark from the artisanal fisheries operating in Mayumba using demersal set gillnets represent 2% of shark landings (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). These artisanal fisheries capture this species seasonally (dry season from June to September) and CPUE has been stable with an average of 4.5 kg landed per day (peak of 12 kg per day) between 2014–2019, however, fishing effort has increased during the same period (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). In the Republic of the Congo, 24 individuals were recorded during landing site surveys from January 2019 to December 2019, most of which were caught in encircling nets (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). However, visits to industrial landing sites in the past indicate they are captured in trawlers (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). In Cameroon, 28 individuals, mostly juveniles, have been recorded over two years of landing site surveys representing 1.3% of all shark and ray records (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020). In Angola, it was not recorded during opportunistic landing site surveys in 2018 but fishers were able to identify the species by looking at shark illustrations during interviews (A.L. Soares unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>A decline of &gt;90% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) is estimated in Mauritania. Elsewhere, there is limited species-specific reporting, as well as a lack of species-specific time-series data. However, considering general declining catch trends and limited number of specimens recorded in fisheries surveys in several localities, the level of intense and large unmanaged fisheries that operate throughout its range, its lack of refuge at depth, its susceptibility to fisheries, and noted declines in other sharks (including the Common Smoothhound) it is suspected that the Atlantic Weasel Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (39 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation.<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Weasel Shark is found in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Oceans from Mauritania to Namibia,&#160;including the&#160;<span style="""">Cape Verde Archipelago</span>&#160;(Wirtz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).&#160;A northwest Atlantic record based on a specimen from New England in 1906, and a record from Madagascar, are questionable (Carpenter and De Angelis 2016).","The Atlantic Weasel Shark is commercially valuable across its range where it is utilized fresh, smoked, or dried-salted for human consumption (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across the Cape Verde Archipelago, it is widely consumed as dried shark meat (cação) (S. Pires unpubl. data 2020). Fins are not considered valuable due to their small size but are still traded internationally (P. Doherty, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2020). It is sometimes processed into fishmeal (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,"There are no known conservation measures in place for this species. Although countries across the region have legislations concerning fisheries activities (including finning bans, gear restrictions, and no-trawling zones in coastal waters), fisheries taking the Atlantic Weasel Shark are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species’ range, and it is unlikely that pressure will decrease in the near future. <br/><br/>A number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing one (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro et al. 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Whilst Gabon have recently expanded marine protected area coverage to 26% of their Exclusive Economic Zone, other countries such as the Republic of the Congo, and Côte d'Ivoire are still in the process of expanding their marine protected area networks, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 260 m. The species is a bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial gears including demersal trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet and is retained for human consumption and fish meal. The Spotless Smooth-hound has declined by 75% over three generation lengths (30 years) in Viet Nam. Landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs indicate declines of 30–98% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the entire spatial and depth range of the Spotless Smooth-hound. It is a valued species that was targeted in the past. Once common, it is now reported as rare in parts of Taiwan, yet stable over the past 15 years in one part of Japan, where fishing pressure has reduced in recent years. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some  refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Spotless Smooth-hound has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three  generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Spotless Smooth-hound is demersal from inshore waters to a depth of 260 m (Aonuma <em>et al. </em>2013, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 108 cm total length (TL), males mature at 62–70 cm TL and females mature at 68–80 cm TL (Teshima 1981, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of 5–16, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 28 cm TL (Teshima 1981, Wang and Chen 1981, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Female age-at-maturity is 5–5.3 years and maximum age is estimated as 15 years, based on the Spotless Smooth-hound growth curve; generation length is therefore 10 years (Wang and Chen 1982).","The Spotless Smooth-hound is subject to fishing pressure across its range.  It was previously targeted and is now taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. Trawls and longline operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption. <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Spotless Smooth-hound.</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao<em> et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a>  In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273</a><a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAOb 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is taken in offshore industrial demersal trawl and longline fisheries that operate in depths of 50</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">–150 m, and was commonly captured in trawls from 1980</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">–</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">2000 (V.

Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020).</a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""><br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation. </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson<em> et al. </em>1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</a>","<p><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">There are no species-specific time-series available. This species was considered abundant in Taiwan in the past, but is now rare in some areas such as the southwest (Lee 2003, H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). In Japan, the abundance of this species </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143""> in the western waters of Kyushu </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">has remained stable since 2001 (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2006). It was considered common in Viet Nam but since </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">2000 </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">catches have decreased by 60% (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). This is inferred to represent a reduction in the abundance of the species as effort was increasing during that period.<br/><br/>Landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The landings data showed a 52% decline in all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953</a><a name=""_Hlk22720982""> </a>to 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s. Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the<a name=""_Hlk20403173""></a> Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam EEZs, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016, Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). In Japan and China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 98% and 67% decline, respectively in landings over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, this decline was from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. In China, the decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, the reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in  landings of sharks, rays, and skates over 46 years from 1969 to 2014. There  were minimal catches during 1950 that then rose steeply during the  mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t followed by a steady decline to 294 t in  2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Fishing effort in South Korea has  increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em>  2011). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in  landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per  year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the  early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady  decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines  in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent  reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased  substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a  decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Spotless Smooth-hound (30 years) they represent declines of 30%, 88%, 40%, 90%, and 98% in Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, and Viet Nam, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The 60% catch decline in Viet Nam of the Spotless Smooth-hound represents a decline of 75% over three generation lengths (30 years). Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high  across the entire spatial and depth range of the Spotless Smooth-hound. The species is a valued bycatch of a range of artisanal and industrial fisheries which operate with small trawl and net mesh sizes, and have been intensive for a considerable time. Once common, it is now reported as rare in parts of Taiwan, yet stable over the past 15 years in one part of Japan. The low age-at-maturity, annual reproductive cycle, and moderate sized litters may provide some resilience to fishing pressure. The inshore and seasonal trawl bans in Taiwan and China waters may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, across its range, the species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<strong></strong></p>",Decreasing,"The Spotless Smooth-hound is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific Oceans where it occurs from Japan to Viet Nam, including the Koreas, China, and Taiwan (Aonuma <em>et al. </em>2013, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The species is valued for its meat and fins (Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al. </em>2018). In Japan, the meat is flash boiled and sold as ubiki with mid-range market value in areas of southern Japan (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Smaller individuals may be used for fish meal in Taiwan and China, and possibly Viet Nam. In China, this species is used for the liver oil (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. <a name=""_Hlk21700268"">In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). Some of the species range may be protected along the China coastline as it is estimated that ~20% of the coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012).</a> <br/><br/>In Taiwan, there is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). This species may be protected in some of&#160;the ~32  Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of  Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for  0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively  (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019).<a name=""_Hlk21700268""> In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014).

It inhabits the continental shelf at depths of 15–105 m but little is known of its biology. The species is a bycatch and byproduct of a number of fisheries that operate throughout its range, including trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach   seine, and gillnet. The species is retained for consumption and trade of the pectoral fins (wings). Trawl fishing effort is heavy along the west and south coasts, and was also heavy along the east coast until effort declines in recent decades. This species has a restricted distribution and very little refuge from   fishing within its relatively limited depth range. Trend analysis of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas estimated a population reduction of 70% over the past three generation lengths (27 years), with the highest probability of a 50–79% reduction over the past three generation lengths.  Overall, given that the research survey area is across most of this species' range and over the length of three generations, the estimated  population reduction is likely highly indicative of the level of actual reduction of this species. Therefore, it is estimated that the Twineye Skate has  undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three  generation lengths (27 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Twineye Skate is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 15–105 m, and possibly deeper (Last<em> et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of ~49 cm total length (TL) (Last<em> et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is oviparous but nothing else is known of its biology, and size-at-maturity, age-at-maturity, and maximum age are unknown. Age parameters are inferred from verified age estimates of a congener, the Rough Skate (<em>Raja radula</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 12 years (Kadri&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013); generation length is therefore inferred as 9 years for the Twineye Skate.","The Twineye Skate is a bycatch and byproduct species of a range of fisheries, including trawl, commercial and  recreational line, beach seine, and gillnet (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). When captured incidentally, the species is often retained due to its value and is thus considered a byproduct. In South Africa,  trawl fishing pressure is heavy along the west and south coasts, and was  formerly heavy along the east coast until a decline in effort in that area over the last decade (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Longline fishing occurs throughout its range, and  recreational line fishing may pose a threat to this species, although shoreline fishing effort has decreased over the last 16 years as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches. The Twineye Skate has very little refuge from  fishing within its restricted distribution and relatively limited depth range.","There are no estimates of population size for the Twineye Skate. Population trend data of annual density estimates (kg per nm² area swept) were available from demersal research trawl surveys conducted over 26 years (1991–2016) in commercially fished areas of South Africa during autumn and spring along the south coast by the Fisheries Branch of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF, unpubl. data, 2018). The trend data were analysed over three generation lengths (27 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of reduction of 4.6% over the trawl grounds, consistent with an estimated reduction of 70.1% over the past three generation lengths (27 years), with the highest probability (62.5%) of a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths. The research trawl survey gear was modified in recent years and is now very inefficient at catching skates, which could account for some of the recent decline in research catch rates (R. Leslie, unpubl. data, 2018). Overall though, given that most of this species' range occurs within the research survey area, and that the survey period (26 years) is very close to the three generation lengths (27 years), the estimated population reduction is highly likely indicative of the level of actual reduction of this species.

130393975,130393378,Squatina guggenheim,Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Angular Angelshark (<em>Squatina guggenheim</em>) is a small demersal shark that reaches a maximum total length of 95 cm total length and inhabits soft sediments from 10 to 80 m depth on the continental shelf in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to northern Patagonia, Argentina. Threats to this species include being caught as bycatch in trawl and bottom-set gillnets. The species' low reproductive potential (litter size of 3-9 and  triennial female breeding cycle) together with its vulnerability to both  trawl and gillnet gear makes it highly susceptible to population  depletion. Angel sharks are notoriously difficult to identify, and catches are typically reported at the generic level and therefore include at least three species that are native to the region (the Angular Angelshark, the Argentine Angelshark (<em>S. argentina</em>), and the Hidden Angelshark (<em>S. occulta</em>)). Angel sharks are heavily fished in southern Brazil and  significant declines have been documented there as well as in Uruguay and Argentina. Although data in some parts of the species’ range (e.g. southern Brazil) infer population reductions of angel sharks of &gt;90% over the last three generations (24 years), reductions have not been as severe in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), reaching 55% over the last three generations. Reductions further south in Argentina are again more than 90%. On balance of these reductions, an overall population reduction of at least 70% is inferred over three generations.<strong> </strong>The Angular Angelshark is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd. Fishing continues throughout the species' range. Management and enforcement are urgently needed, particularly in areas outside of the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone, in order to to conserve this species. <strong></strong><strong></strong>","The Angular Angelshark is a relatively small demersal shark with a maximum size of 95 cm total length (TL) (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). The species lives on sandy and muddy substrates at depths of 10 to 80 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013)<em></em>. The angel sharks are lecithotrophic viviparous. On the shelf of southern Brazil this species completes its whole life cycle within that shelf area. The adults migrate seasonally across the shelf, between the offshore waters and the shallow coastal nursery zone, where birth occurs in spring (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Both sexes mature at 4 years of age and at 73-80 cm TL (Vaz and Carvalho 2013). This species has 3-9 pups per litter that are 25 cm TL at birth, reproduces once every three years, and lives to be a maximum of 12 years old (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Generation length is 8 years (Vieira 1996).","The Angular Angelshark is threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries. Angel sharks lie motionless on the sea floor during the day but actively forage at night, and therefore they are highly susceptible to bottom-set gillnets that are set at night (Standora and Nelson 1977). The great increase of the annual angel shark catches in southern Brazil in 1992-1993 was due to a new fishery that targeted angel sharks specifically with bottom gillnets on the outer shelf (Klippel <em>et al.</em> 2005). Bottom gillnets were up to six times as effective as bottom trawls in terms of mean annual angel shark CPUE (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).<strong>&#160;</strong>After declines occurred as a result of trawl fisheries, the directed fishing with bottom gillnets was an additional threat to the Brazilian population of the Angular Angelshark. <strong><br/></strong><br/>Bottom trawling in Brazil targets an array of productive bony fishes, while elasmobranchs are caught as commercially valuable bycatch. Between 1985 and 2002, species such as the Angular Angelshark were overfished while the more productive species of fishes continue to sustain these fisheries (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Klippel <em>et al. </em>2005). <br/><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>An angel shark bottom gillnet fishery on the outer shelf commenced  around 1990 and large amounts of angel shark were caught this  way until 2004 when the species became protected in Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003). <strong><br/></strong><br/>Chiaramonte (1998) stated that the angel sharks were the second most  important fish landed by the gillnet fleet of Puerto Quequen, Argentina.","Angel shark identification in the Southwest Atlantic is difficult, and therefore catches are typically reported for the genus rather than at the species level. There are three species with overlapping ranges, depths, and habitat types in the region (Angular, Argentine, and Hidden Angelsharks), and all are likely to face similar threats and fishing pressure. <br/><br/><strong>Brazil</strong><br/>Since   the year 1980 two bottom gillnet fisheries have been in operation, one targeting the anglerfish&#160;<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em> with angel sharks as bycatch, the other  targeting  angel sharks (UNIVALI 2004, Klippel <em>et al.</em> 2005). Research trawl surveys of the outer shelf  in the years 1986/87 and 2001/02 confirmed that in southern Brazil the  abundance of angel sharks  had at the time decreased to 15% of its original  level and this is attributed to  recruitment overfishing primarily due  to the bottom gillnet fishery  (Vooren and Lamónaca 2002, Vooren and  Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>In  the year  2003, angel sharks made up 0.4% and 0.2% of the annual total  fish catch  by respectively bottom trawl and bottom gillnet (UNIVALI  2004). Annual research trawl CPUE (ton/trip) of this species reached its  highest  historical level in the years 1980-1986 and then decreased  gradually to  20% of that level in the year 2000 (Miranda and Vooren  2003, Vooren and  Klippel 2005). The annual landings of ‘angel shark’ in Itajaí, which is the main   fishing port in southern Brazil, decreased sharply from 431 t in the year   2004, to only 5 t in the year 2012, which is the most recent year for   which fishery statistics are available (UNIVALI 2013). In the UNIVALI   statistics of angel shark landings in the period 2000-2012, it is seen   that the sudden decline of the annual landings after the year 2004   occurred simultaneously in all four fishing methods that habitually   landed angel sharks. It is therefore presumed that the decline of the   angel shark landings in southern Brazil in the period 2004-2012 was due to   the reaction of the fishing fleet to efficient enforcement of the   prohibition of landing angel sharks. <br/> <strong><br/></strong><strong></strong><strong>Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ)</strong><br/>In Uruguay, annual catches of all three species  together were about 300 t in the years 1998-2001 (Paesch&#160;and Domingo  2003). The estimated capture has been 200 to 400 metric tons (MT) per year between  1997 and 2005. Between 1997 and 2010, the average declared landings of angel sharks was 277 t and decreased to 50 t in 2011 and 2012 to  rise again to 170 t in 2013 (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is no  clear trend in the landings data from Uruguay from 1996 to 2018 (CTMFM  2018). There are no statistics by species, but during research surveys  in the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ), Milessi <em>et al. </em>(2001) found that the Angular Angelshark was the dominant species in the catch.&#160;Argentinian  landings in the AUCFZ declined by 51% between 1996 and 2017, equivalent  to a &gt;55% decline over three generation lengths (24 years) (CTMFM 2018).&#160; <br/><br/><strong>Argentina (south of the Argentinean-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone)</strong><strong></strong><br/>On  the shelf of Argentina, angel sharks are fished by bottom trawls   (Cousseau and Perrotta 2000) and the catches consist mostly of Angular Angelshark (Errazti <em>et al.</em> 2002 cited in Massa and Hozbor 2003). <br/><br/>Total captures of angel sharks in Argentina oscillated around 1,000 MT  between 1979 and 1984 then increased to maximums of over 4,000 MT in the  1990s. Peaks were reached in 1997 and 1998, before landings dropped in 2002 to 2,000 MT, rising again in 2003 to 3,550 MT (Massa <em>et al.</em> 2004). Thus there was an overall negative trend in landings during the period 1998-2003 (Massa <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>The maximum permitted annual catch of angel shark in Argentina (MPC, see   below under Conservation) was 6,000 t in the years 1995-1999.   Subsequently, MPC was set at 4,000 t in the year 2000, and at 3,000 t in   the year 2003 (Consejo Federal Pesquero 2003, Massa <em>et al</em>. 2003). The 50% reduction of the MPC from 6,000 t   to 3,000 t in the years 1995-2003 may have been a fishery management   response to a decrease of the availability of this species in the   fishing areas of the Argentinian trawler fleet. <br/><br/>The   Common Argentina-Uruguay Fishery Zone has its own MPC, which was set at   2600 t for the year 2016. However, in that year Argentina and Uruguay   together landed from the Common Fishery Zone only 2270.4 t. This 329.6 t of unused quota may be evidence of a declining availability of&#160; angel sharks in the Common Fishery Zone  (<a href=""http://pescare.com.ar/zona-comun-de-pesca-fijan-captura-total-permisible-de-gatuzo-pez-angel-palo-y-besugo/"">http://pescare.com.ar/zona-comun-de-pesca-fijan-captura-total-permisible-de-gatuzo-pez-angel-palo-y-besugo/</a>).<br/><br/>For  the period 1992-1998, Massa and Hozbor (2003)  analyzed annual CPUE in kg/hour of fishing by the  Argentinian trawler fleet.  In that period, CPUE decreased gradually by  58% in seven years (equivalent to a decline of &gt;96% over three generation lengths). From 2000 to 2013, annual landings  of angel sharks in Argentina  increased from 3126.7 t (year 2000) to a peak of 5,232.2 t (year 2010), then  decreased to 2,854.1 t (year 2013), a drop in landings of 46% (Navarro <em>et  al.</em> 2014). In the year 2008, angel shark made  up 0.6% of the  total annual marine fish catch (Navarro <em>et al.</em>  2014).&#160; <br/><br/>Given the heavy fishing pressure across its range and reported declines in landings from all three range states over the past two decades, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 70% over the past three generations (24 years).<em><br/></em>",Decreasing,The Angular Angelshark is distributed over the continental shelf of the Southwest Atlantic between Rio de Janeiro (24<sup>o</sup>S) and northern Patagonia (42<sup>o</sup>S) (Awruch <em>et al.</em> 2008). <em><br/><br/><br/><br/></em><em><br/></em>,"Angel sharks, including this species, are caught and retained as valuable bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries. Their meat is sold fresh or salted and dried for local consumption. In Brazil, the meat is marketed as <em>cacao anjo</em> and is typically more valuable than other <em>cacao</em> shark meat (P. Dolphine unpubl. data 2018). Although the species is officially protected in Brazil, it is still retained and sold in markets (Almerón-Souza <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>In Uruguay, the species is targeted for its meat in gillnet and bottom  trawl fisheries and is also caught as bycatch on demersal longlines  (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; <br/><br/>In Argentina, this species is  not targeted directly in fisheries, but is caught as bycatch in demersal  trawl and gillnet fisheries. Angel sharks are sold locally and consumed  fresh (<em>pollo de mar</em>) and/or salted and dried (<em>bacalao argentino</em>) (Chiaramonte 1998).",Marine,"In Brazil, trawling in inshore waters is prohibited and all angel  sharks are protected, but enforcement of this regulation has been and  still is not sufficient (Vooren and Klippel 2005, Montealegre-Quijano  unpubl. data 2017). The conservation status of this species will rely  heavily upon the successful implementation of these management  arrangements. Full observer coverage onboard domestic vessels should  provide accurate monitoring of trends in the future. Molecular markers  of <em>Squatina</em> spp. have been determined for future  identification of these species in local markets (Falcão <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In  September 2018, the government of the state of Rio Grande do Sul  approved a law that extends the range in which fishing with trawls is  prohibited. With the sanction and regulation of the law, the protected  area will be increased from three nautical miles (5.5 km) offshore to 12  nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore.<br/><br/>The Angular Angelshark  is classified as Critically Endangered (A2bd+4bd) in Brazil (ICMBio  2016). The Angular and Hidden Angelsharks are also both classified as  Critically Endangered there, and all three of these species are fully  protected in Brazil as of 2014 by the normative instructions numbers 5  and 445.<br/><br/> The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for chondrichthyans  in the Argentina and Uruguay Common Fishing Zone (AUCFZ) is regulated  by the Binational Technical Comision (<em>Comisión Técnica Mixta del Frente Marítimo</em>). Only 3 groups are regulated by a TAC limit each year: the smoothhound <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, the angel sharks <em>Squatina </em>spp.  and skates (Rajiformes). The TAC for angel sharks was constant between  2012 and 2016 (2,600 tonnes) and only in 2012 was this exceeded, with a  total catch of 2709.2 t for Argentina and 27 t for Uruguay.<br/><br/>There  is only one specifically managed fishing area for chondrichthyans in  the Argentine Sea and is located inside the Argentina and Uruguay Common  Fishing Zone between 36° and 37°S. This coastal area of about 4,562 km²  is closed from October to March and protects diverse species and  reproductive stages of demersal and benthic chondrichthyans (Colonello <em>et al.</em>  2014), including angel sharks. The total amount of days changes between  years and it is applied to all type of vessels using bottom net  trawling.<br/><br/>Nursery areas of the  species have not been found in southern Brazil and may exist further  south off Uruguay and/or Argentina. A new abundance estimate in southern  Brazil is urgently needed after almost a decade of no-take protection  in the country.

Following the near doubling of the industrial trawl fleets in most West African nations in the late 1990s, steep catch declines occurred&#160;to the level where pair trawling became unprofitable around 2005. A scientific trawl survey conducted along the West African coast reported a 37% decline in sciaenid biomass from 2000 to 2006. In Ghana, the body size of sciaenids in the catch declined by 50% from 1990 to the 2000s.&#160;This species is currently considered overexploited in Liberia and Benin. Fishing effort has either increased or remained the same over time, so declines are inferred to have continued. Based on these catch and fisheries survey data, this species is suspected to have declined by at least 50% over the past three generation lengths (18 to 36 years), or since the 1990s. It is listed as Endangered A2bd. Improvements in fisheries and population monitoring are needed.","This demersal species inhabits sandy, muddy and rocky substrates. Spawning occurs near estuaries (F.

The natural mortality rate is estimated as 0.37 yr<sup>-1</sup>. The maximum total&#160;length is 150 cm, longevity is about 21 years of age and age at first maturity is 3-4 years (Wehye <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). When applying an age at first reproduction of 3-4 years and longevity of 21 years, its estimated generation length is 12 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.&#160;<span style="""">When applying an alternative equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods:&#160;1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is about 6-7 years.</span>","Overfishing is the primary major threat to this species.&#160;<br/><br/>Bottom trawling activity in West Africa has degraded the habitat that demersal species are dependent on. Pollution from agricultural chemicals, sewage and litter may also exacerbate degradation of marine habitats. Oil slicks from oil extraction in the region (Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and soon Ghana) is also a threat to fishes. An expected increase in sea surface temperatures due to global climate change has the potential to cause a reduction in the intensity of upwelling in the region, which is the main driver for marine productivity.","This is the most common sciaenid species in West Africa (F.

With the implementation of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the late 1970s, the range of many fleets was reduced. In the late 1990s, the numbers of trawlers almost doubled in most West African nations in response to the profitability of the industry, but catch rates declined to the level where pair trawling commenced around 2005. Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana and Cameroon have the largest fishing fleets in West Africa.&#160;This species primarily inhabits coastal waters to depths of 60 m, which is well within the depth and habitat that trawling occurs (25 to 75 m).&#160;<br/><br/>The Fridtjof&#160;Nansen stock assessment survey&#160;for all sciaenids (10 species)&#160;in the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem indicated sciaenid biomass declined by 37% over a six-year time period from 1,046 tonnes in 2000&#160;to 664 t in 2006. Fishing effort has increased or remained the same over time, and therefore, biomass is inferred to have continued to decline. Mean body sizes of sciaenids in trawl surveys conducted in Ghana declined by 50% over time, from over 50 cm in 1989-1990 to&#160;around 25-30 cm in the 2000s (F. Nunoo pers. comm.). In Liberia, this species is overexploited and growth overfishing is occurring (Wehye <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). It is also overexploited in Benin (Sossoukpe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Small individuals of this species are frequently discarded as bycatch, which has also contributed to overfishing.&#160;Based on these data, this species has undergone a suspected global-level decline of at least 50% over the past three generation lengths, an estimated period of 18-36 years.",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the eastern Atlantic from Morocco to Namibia, including Cabo Verde.

It is&#160;inferred that the Taiwan Angelshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (69 years) due to high levels of exploitation across its entire range, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Taiwan Angelshark is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 100–400 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL); males and females mature at ~100 cm TL (Ebert<em> et al.</em> 2013). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with litter sizes of up to 16 pups (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproductive periodicity is unknown but could be two years based on other <em>Squatina </em>species (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely-related species, the Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina californica</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 8–13 years and a maximum age of 35 years, resulting in a generation length of 23 years (Cailliet <em>et al. </em>1992).","The Taiwan Angelshark is subject to fishing pressure across the entire range of its shelf and upper slope habitats. The species is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries by deep-water trawl, and possibly gillnet and longline, and retained for the meat and fins, and for fish meal. <br/><br/>By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawls are one of the main gear types and operate to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. The trawl fishery targets multiple species of shrimp, uses small mesh sizes, and on southwest coast, has been intensive for a considerable time (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish  too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish  meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity  of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC  2016).</a>","<p>The Taiwan Angelshark is seen infrequently in Taiwan and in low numbers at landing sites but this level of abundance has remained little changed over the past 17 years, based on regular surveys at landing sites (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019); although there is no concurrent effort data from the area of the landing sites to infer population trends. There is no species-specific data from Taiwan, however landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased or remained stable while fishing effort has increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort.<br/><br/>The landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 55% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (69 years) for the Taiwan Angelshark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/><br/><em>Squatina </em>spp. populations have dramatically declined when fished intensively for as little as two decades,  as seen in Australia, the Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Southwest Atlantic (Graham <em>et al. </em>2001, Awruch <em>et al.</em> 2019, Lawson <em>et al. </em>2019).

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 0–330 m, but possibly occurs deeper. The species is taken as bycatch with demersal trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline gear, and retained for the meat, fins, and fish meal. In parts of Japan, catches are double those of its congener the Japanese Angelshark (<em>S. japonica</em>). In Taiwan, along with the Taiwan Angelshark (<em>S. formosa</em>), it is the most common angelshark seen at markets, and although angelsharks are not seen frequently, the abundance of the Clouded Angelshark has changed little over the past 20 years. Elsewhere, Angelshark (<em>Squatina </em>spp.) stocks have declined dramatically (&gt;80%) where they have been intensively fished for as little as two decades which is evidence that <em>Squatina</em> spp. are unable to sustain intense fishing pressure. Fishing pressure is high across most of the range of the Clouded Angelshark, however it is suspected to have some refuge from set net fisheries at depth, is more fecund than its congeners, and in Taiwan there has been little change to its observed abundance over the past 20 years.

It is taken as bycatch by demersal trawl, gillnet, set net, and longline and retained. The exception is Japan where it is possibly discarded as the declining catch rates have led to the lack of a market for this species (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). It is suspected to be less at risk of capture in gillnet and set net fisheries than the Japanese Angelshark (<em>S. japonica</em>) as it is suspected of occurring deeper than the Japanese Angelshark (S. Tanaka and A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). </p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22884500"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people moving into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan, and Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5 kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019a). Although the high demand may lead to an increase in imports, it is assumed that it is also leads to ongoing pressure on domestic fisheries which in turn leads to ongoing threats to the Clouded Angleshark.<br/></a></p>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al. </em>2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>    <p>The Yellow Sea was once one of the most intensively exploited Large Marine Ecosystems in the world and is considered severely impacted in terms of overfishing, with destructive fishing practices (NOAA 2009). In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). </p>  <p></p><p>Additionally, market surveys in China (Hainan province) revealed that despite being caught as bycatch, demand is low for this species (the meat is considered low-quality) and it was observed being left to perish following landing (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s (~2,000% increase), along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019c, Rueter<em> et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019c, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (~350–500% increase) (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 26/08/2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<a name=""_Hlk21696013""> Small individuals of the Clouded Angelshark that are not used for human consumption would be used for fish meal.<br/></a></p>  <p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include dramatic habitat loss in the region. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). This may impact the inshore component of the species range.</p>","<p>Across Japan, the population trend of the Clouded Angelshark has decreased. In Suruga Bay (southeast Japan), it is captured more frequently than its congener the Japanese Angelshark (<em>S. japonica</em>) with twice as many individuals (i.e., 400 individuals) captured over the past 40 years during demersal trawl and gillnet surveys (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, this species and the Taiwan Angelshark (<em>S. formosa</em>) are the most common angelsharks found at the fish markets, particularly on the east coast (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b). Large individuals of the Clouded Angelshark taken as bycatch by longline are commonly seen on the east coast (usually several individuals in one day), whereas on the west coast the individuals observed are bycatch of demersal trawl and are mostly small with some neonates present (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Although one of the most common angelsharks, the Clouded Angelshark is seen in low numbers, yet its abundance has changed little over the past 20 years (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019).</p><p><strong></strong>Angelshark (<em>Squatina</em> spp.) populations have dramatically declined (&gt;80%) when fished intensively for as little as two decades, as seen in Australia, the Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Southwest Atlantic (Graham<em> et al.</em> 2001, Awruch<em> et al. </em>2019, Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2020, Hiddink&#160;<em>et al. </em>2019). These dramatic declines indicate that the <em>Squatina</em> spp. are unable to sustain intense target or bycatch fishing pressure, even when fisheries management is implemented. </p>  <p>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the spatial and depth range of this species. It is suspected that this species occurs deeper than the Japanese Angelshark and thus is less at risk from gillnet and set net fisheries which, along with the higher fecundity, may account for double the observed catches of this species in parts of Japan compared to those of the Japanese Angelshark. Overall, based on actual levels of exploitation, inferred reductions from other <em>Squatina</em> spp, and a low and fairly stable abundance in Taiwan over the past 20 years, it is suspected that the Clouded Angelshark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (69 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Clouded Angelshark is endemic to the Northwest Pacific Ocean, where it occurs from Japan to Taiwan, including the Ryukyu Islands, North and South Korea, and China (Walsh <em>et al. </em>2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a).","The species is used for its meat and fins. In some parts of Japan, the meat was previously valuable, particularly when flash boiled and sold as ubiki, but this process is difficult and not popular among younger people and the value of the meat has since declined. The meat is considered less valuable than that of the Japanese Angelshark (<em>S. japonica</em>) (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, large individuals are cut and sold as low value fresh meat (H. Ho unpubl. data 2020).

Trawling is banned all year round in the Bohai Sea (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J.

Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>In Sabah and Sarawak, the Ocellated Angelshark is mostly caught by deep-water trawls that operate more than 60 nautical miles from the shore (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020)<span lang=""EN-AU"">.     There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).</p>","<p>The Ocellated Angelshark is not reported as abundant anywhere but rather as taken in small numbers in Taiwan and elsewhere,  including Viet Nam, Hong Kong, and Borneo (Theiss and Ebert 2013).<br/><br/>There is no species-specific data from Taiwan, however landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Taiwanese landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark  species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from  ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then  declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial fishing effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 55% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (69 years) for the Ocellated Angelshark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/><br/>In China, Viet Nam, and Borneo,  catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">EEZ</a>s, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). The reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings of sharks,  rays, and skates in China. The decline was from around 90,000 t  annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Additionally, in  China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and  rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader  trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China  as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive  fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang  2019). In Viet Nam, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings  of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014.  Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the  mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a  peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750  t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in sharks, rays,  and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their  populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the  1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings  (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). <span lang=""EN-AU"">In Borneo, landings of the Ocellated Angelshark are  rare with less than 5 individuals landed per year (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data  2020). There are no species-specific trend data however reconstructed  shark (<span lang=""EN-AU"">carcharhinid) landings increased in Sarawak  throughout  the 1950s and sharply increased in the early 1970s to over  7,000  tonnes. They then decreased to 4–5,000 tonnes throughout the  1980s  before increasing to 7,400 tonnes again in 1997 and then  decreasing by <span lang=""EN-AU"">66% to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). In Sabah, landings of <span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU"">shark (<span lang=""EN-AU"">carcharhinid)   slowly increased from the  1950s to the late 1980s before steeply  increasing to 14,800 t in 1995  and then decreasing by 34% to 9,400 t in  2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). Fishing pressure has been  increasing since the 1950s and thus  these declines infer reductions in  the populations of sharks in  Borneo.</span></span></span><br/><br/>These declines represent 69%, 99%, 99% and 81% reductions in China, Viet Nam,   Sarawak and Sabah respectively when scaled to the past three generation lengths (69 years)   of the Ocellated Angelshark. These levels of decline are not species-specific but informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks and rays in the region. <em>Squatina</em> spp. populations have dramatically declined when  fished intensively for as little as two decades, as seen in Australia,  the Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Southwest Atlantic  (Graham <em>et al. </em>2001, Awruch <em>et al</em>. 2019, Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2019). These dramatic declines indicate that the <em>Squatina</em> spp. are unable to sustain intense target or bycatch fishing pressure. Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the  range of this species, inferred declines based on all elasmobranchs are  55–99% across the past three generation lengths of the Ocellated  Angelshark (69 years), and this species likely has little resilience to  fishing pressure. Overall, based on actual levels of exploitation, it is  suspected that the Ocellated Angelshark has undergone a population  reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (69 years).<span lang=""EN-AU""> </span></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"The Ocellated Angelshark is endemic to the Northwest and Western Central Pacific Oceans and occurs in Taiwan, China, Viet Nam, and Borneo (Walsh <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Theiss and Ebert 2013).","The species is used for its meat and fins. It is low value meat and the fins are typically small and also of relatively low value; smaller individuals are used for fish meal (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). <br/><br/>Since the late 1990s, Chinese regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020). Throughout Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Research is needed on population size and trends, and life history, and catches should be monitored.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It is a bentho-pelagic species that occurs from inshore and estuarine areas to offshore habitats in depths of up to 100 m. It is the most productive sawfish species, reaching maturity early (2–3 yr) and having intrinsic rates of population increase &gt;0.27 yr<sup>-1</sup>, making it less susceptible to fishing pressure than other sawfish species. However, it does have the highest post release mortality of all sawfish species. While the current population size and its historic abundance are unknown, it persists in most of its range states, but in substantially lower numbers than historically. Like other sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Narrow Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets. The species has been affected by commercial net and trawl fisheries, which operate in inshore areas of its range, reductions in habitat quality and coastal development, the impacts of which have cumulatively led to population decline. This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, is protected in some range states as a no-take species, and is sheltered in some areas that are closed to fishing; but these actions alone will not be sufficient to ensure its survival in some regions. Ongoing fishing and development is likely to lead to future population declines. Despite a lack of quantitative data to support declines, current information indicates that Narrow Sawfish across its Indo-West Pacific range are considerably more rare than historically recorded. Declines of between 50 and 70% over three generation lengths (~18 years) are suspected and have primarily been attributed to ongoing capture in commercial net and trawl fisheries, with the Narrow Sawfish being particularly susceptible given it has poor post-release survival.<br/><br/>The previous assessment of this species was Critically Endangered. However, given the new information that has become available since the last assessment and the fact that the more dramatic declines have happened outside of the three generation period (~18 years), the species now meets the criteria for an Endangered listing (representing a non-genuine change in status based on new information available since the time of the last assessment).<span lang=""EN-CA""><strong><em></em></strong>  <p></p>","The Narrow Sawfish is a bentho-pelagic species that inhabits estuarine, inshore and offshore waters to at least 40 m depth (Last and Stevens 2009). Inshore and estuarine waters are critical habitats for juveniles and pupping females, whilst adults predominantly occur offshore (Peverell 2005). <br/><br/>Narrow Sawfish mature at two to three years of age, at around 200 cm total length (TL) and 230 cm TL for males and females, respectively (Peverell 2005). They are estimated to live, on average, to nine years and have a generation length of approximately six years (Peverell 2005, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Moreno Iturria 2012). They are presumed to have an annual birth cycle, with an average of 12 pups per litter (Peverell 2005, D’Anastasi 2010). Preliminary genetic research suggests that, in contrast to most elasmobranchs, Narrow Sawfish may not have multiple fathers per litter (D’Anastasi 2010). Intrinsic rates of population increase based on life history data from the exploited population in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, has been estimated to be around 0.27 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Moreno Iturria 2012), with a population doubling time of ~2.6 yr. These demographic parameters indicate that this species is more productive than other species of sawfish, which may explain why this species has persisted longer under moderate to heavy fishing pressure, while other sawfish species have disappeared.","The toothed rostrum of Narrow Sawfish, and their primarily coastal distribution, makes them highly susceptible to fishing pressure through entanglement of their rostrum in fishing gear and habitat degradation, which has resulted in populations becoming increasingly rare and fragmented. Demand for their high value products, along with their high incidental catch rates and high post release mortality (Peverell 2005, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010) are the drivers of the threat posed by fisheries. Fishing, especially gillnetting and trawling, is the most pervasive threat to Narrow Sawfish (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007). Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catch may be a threat for Narrow Sawfish in many regions, such as northern Australia where it has been well documented (Lack and Sant 2008). An assessment of the sustainability of sharks and rays in Australian fisheries reported in Salini <em>et al</em>. (2007) found Narrow Sawfish to be at high risk of being fished unsustainably due to their high catchability in fishing gear, and their life history. More recent work on age and growth of this species has shown them to be more productive than other sawfishes and a more recent ecological risk assessment identified them as being at medium risk of being overfished (Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010). The level of risk is likely to be much higher through most of the rest of its range because fishing levels in northern Australia are relatively light.<br/><br/>In general, juveniles, which use inshore nursery grounds, interact regularly with coastal and estuarine gillnet fisheries (Peverell 2005). Pregnant females also interact with inshore net fisheries (see D’Anastasi 2010). Late stage juveniles and mature animals tend to interact with offshore gillnet and trawl fisheries (Peverell 2005, Northern Territory Government Department of Regional Development, Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources 2008, Stapley and Rose 2009).<br/><br/>In Australian waters, Narrow Sawfish are the most commonly caught sawfish in the Northern Territory (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), Gulf of Carpentaria (Peverell 2005), Queensland east coast (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Western Australia (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2005). Commercial fishery catches of Narrow Sawfish in Australian waters remain significant, including in the inshore gillnet fishery on the east coast of Queensland, with Narrow Sawfish making up ~1.1% of the total elasmobranch catch (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). In addition to the demersal net and trawl fisheries in which all sawfishes are caught, Narrow Sawfish are also caught in pelagic gillnets (i.e. those that do not reach the sea floor), indicating a more diverse set of threats from fishing gear. Narrow Sawfish rostra and fins have also been confiscated from illegal foreign fishing vessels in Australian waters (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007b, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The presence of distinct genetic stocks suggests that if localised depletions do occur, populations may not necessarily be replenished by adjacent stocks within ecologically relevant timeframes (D’Anastasi 2010). The low mitochondrial genetic diversity observed in Australia may also be a risk factor since populations with lower genetic diversity may be at greater risk of losing genetic diversity to a point where losses cannot be recovered and this can lead to inbreeding depression and/or reduced resilience (Frankham 2003, D’Anastasi 2010, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>Coastal development associated with the rapidly expanding mining industry (including mineral, coal, gas and oil mining and associated processing plants and port facilities) is a growing threat to Narrow Sawfish. Increased urbanisation of coastlines is a growing threat too. These activities result in the modification and/or destruction of critical habitat and lead to degraded water quality through pollution (see Mudd and Patterson 2010 for an example). Given the species reliance on estuarine and inshore coastal areas, where most development and pollution is occurring, these threats are of growing concern, although relative to fishing, they are unlikely to substantially affect global status.","Genetic and morphological data supports the division of the global range of the Narrow Sawfish into subpopulations (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Australia, subpopulations on the west and east coasts form distinct genetic stocks, with the Gulf of Carpentaria likely forming a third stock (D’Anastasi 2010, Green 2013). This indicates limited dispersal of at least females. It also indicates that remaining global stocks are likely to be distinct and non-interbreeding, resulting in significant population structure. Genetic diversity, based on mitochondrial DNA, throughout Australian waters is low overall (and lowest on the east coast), with the Narrow Sawfish having the lowest genetic diversity of all sawfish species that occur in Australian waters (D’Anastasi 2010). The genetic diversity throughout the rest of the range is unknown.<br/><br/>Although Narrow Sawfish were relatively common throughout their global distribution, they have declined to varying degrees throughout their range. Accurate estimation of levels of decline are difficult to determine due to the lack of species-specific baseline data (but see Peverell 2008, D’Anastasi 2010, Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Declines are masked by extremely poor reporting practices, misidentification (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stapley and Rose 2009) and the absence of adequate observer programmes. Available catch data and anecdotal evidence indicate severe global declines since the 1960s. Populations are suspected to have declined by 50-70% over the last ~20 years (three generation lengths), with 80% of the population thought to have been lost since the 1960s.<br/><br/>Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program in Australia, which operates ‘bather protection’ fishing gear along the Queensland east coast shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 50-year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern regions of the state (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Northern Australia, particularly the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia (R. McAuley pers. comm. 2012), the Northern Territory (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), the Gulf of Carpentaria (Peverell 2005), and parts of the Queensland east coast (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011), contain the most viable, ecologically functional populations that remain worldwide. Even within these areas, populations are likely to have declined significantly from historic levels. Their presence in fisheries bycatch suggests that viable stocks currently remain.<br/><br/>Landings in India are also still reported (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 2012). Narrow Sawfish are now considered rare in many places where evidence is available, including parts of India (Roy 2010), parts of Bangladesh (Roy 2010), Myanmar (FIRMS 2007–2012), parts of Malaysia (including Borneo) (Almada-Villela 2002, Manjaji 2002), Indonesia (although remnant populations could still exist in the Java Sea) (White and Kyne 2010, P. Last pers. comm. 2012), Thailand (Vidthayanon 1997, Compagno 2002a, CITES 2007), and Singapore (CITES 2007). The last published record from the Straits of Hormuz towards the western edge of its range, is from 1997 (A.B.M. Moore pers. comm. 2012). <br/><br/>The status of populations in the remainder of its range, where surveys or catch monitoring are poor, is uncertain. It is however likely that these populations have declined substantially from pristine levels due to the high level of fishing in many of these areas.",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">The exact historic distribution of Narrow Sawfish is uncertain, but it is highly likely that its full range extended from the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, across southern Asia and the Indo-Australian Archipelago, and north to Japan and South Korea (Last and Stevens 2009, A.B.M. Moore pers. comm. 2012). The western extreme of the range may reach as far as Somalia, with some reports from this region (M.T. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012). The Gulf of Chihli, China, South Korea and the southern portion of Japan are reported as the northernmost extent of occurrence, although this needs clarification <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Fowler 1941, Misra 1969, Chen and Chung 1971, Compagno and Cook 1995)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. The central coasts of western and eastern Australia are confirmed as the southernmost extent (see D’Anastasi 2010).&#160;</span></p>","Narrow Sawfish fins, rostra, meat, liver oil and skin are all highly valued elasmobranch products (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005, Lack and Sant 2008, Lack and Sant 2009). They have been the focus of target fisheries and also retained as bycatch throughout the Indo-West Pacific, including Australia. This has resulted in severe global declines in extent of occurrence. Their fins are particularly valuable as they have a high density of fin needles and can be marketed as ‘white fin’ (considered more valuable than regular shark fin), which are preferred attributes for shark fin soup (CITES 2007). Narrow Sawfish products have also been used as decorations, in ceremonial rituals and for medicinal purposes in Australia, China (McDavitt 1996, McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004) and Myanmar (FIRMS 2007-2012). See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"At the global level, Narrow Sawfish are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, which forbids international trade in the majority of cases. There is a ban on trade in pristid products on eBay, but this is currently ineffective because it is not enforced and material is only removed if it is reported by outside parties. In Australia, legislative protection for Narrow Sawfish as a ‘no-take’ species is in place in Western Australia and Queensland. There are no protections in place in commercial fisheries in the Northern Territory or Commonwealth waters. The take of sawfish is banned in India, but the level of compliance is low, with Narrow Sawfish still being recorded in landings (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>In Australia, codes of practice and training in safe handling of sawfish, as well as measures to avoid catching them, have been promoted in all states and territories. While Narrow Sawfish are the most productive sawfish, they also have the lowest levels of survival following capture and handling (Salini et al. 2007). Careful handling and live release of Narrow Sawfish may play a role in reducing fishery effects, however unlike other sawfish, high post release mortality in this species may ameliorate the positive benefits of good handling practices.<br/><br/>Closures (spatial and temporal) are likely to provide Narrow Sawfish with some level of protection (see D’Anastasi 2010, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, inshore net fisheries in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland have seasonal spatial closures of varying durations between October and January to protect spawning barramundi stocks. These closures afford some protection to a portion of the Narrow Sawfish population, including a portion of the pupping female population (for example, pupping females have been observed inshore in Queensland during October). Some permanent spatial closures implemented within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Representative Areas Program rezoning in 2004 and in Princess Charlotte Bay in 2006 may have benefited Narrow Sawfish. The Northern Territory Government implemented a temporary spatial closure in 2008 in response to the killing of a considerable number of young Narrow Sawfish that was deemed unsustainable.&#160; <br/>Fishing gear modifications offer some options for reducing the bycatch of sawfish. Turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) are mandatory in all Australian prawn trawl fisheries and a study by Brewer <em>et al</em>. (2006) showed that the use of TEDs in a prawn trawl fishery reduced catch of Narrow Sawfish, although the realised conservation benefit may be limited (see Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2006). Brewer <em>et al</em>. (2006) also found that 20% of sawfish were entangled in the top of nets before they reach the TED and it was suggested that lining the front section of the net with canvas, fine metal mesh or tough flexible plastic had potential to reduce sawfish bycatch further, but this remains untested.","",,false,false,Global
141790455,39390,Pristis clavata,Endangered,A2cd,2013,2012-05-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Dwarf Sawfish (<em>Pristis clavata</em>) is possibly now restricted to tropical waters of northern Australia. Historically, it apparently occurred more widely in the Indian Ocean region and South-East Asia, but there are very few verifiable records from outside of Australia and therefore a great deal of uncertainty regarding its true historical distribution. There have been no confirmed records outside of Australia since the 1800s, although it may still persist in other parts of the Indo-West Pacific. Within Australia, its status on the northeastern coast of Queensland is uncertain with no confirmed records, either recent or historic; its confirmed range is from western Cape York, Queensland, to the northern Pilbara region of Western Australia. It may therefore now have the smallest known distribution of any sawfish species. This is a shallow water coastal and estuarine sawfish occurring on sand and mud flats, with a close association to those adjacent to mangroves. Although it penetrates upstream into rivers it does not regularly occur in freshwater reaches. It reaches at least 318 cm total length but its life history is poorly known. Demographic models demonstrate that population productivity is low. Like other sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Dwarf Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets. Historically, the species has been affected by commercial net and trawl fisheries which operate in inshore areas of its range, the cumulative impacts of which have led to the population decline of this and other sawfish species. The restricted inshore occurrence of Dwarf Sawfish makes it particularly susceptible to capture in commercial gillnet fisheries and observer data has shown that mortality associated with such capture is close to 50% despite a ban on retention.<br/><br/>Despite uncertainty regarding the extent of the species’ wider historical range, it can be considered ‘possibly extinct’ outside of Australia with the disappearance of the species probably occurring outside of the last three generation period (pre-1960s; considering that there are no confirmed records since the 1800s). All sawfish species that occur in Australian waters have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines, although the current population size and historical abundance of Dwarf Sawfish is unknown. While specific management measures are now in place in Australia, including full species protection, education of fishers about safe release practices, and fishery-specific management, threats are ongoing and there is no information to suggest that the population is recovering from previous declines. Declines of 50-80% are inferred from capture in continuing commercial fisheries, with the Dwarf Sawfish particularly susceptible given its restricted inshore occurrence and relatively limited global range; it is therefore assessed as Endangered. Some remote regions of northern Australia do however have little commercial fishing activities with some relatively small inshore areas closed to commercial fishing. This may provide localised refugia for Dwarf Sawfish, but until such time that viable populations can be verified, it is assumed that the species is continuing to decline, given that threats are ongoing.<br/>The previous assessment for this species was Critically Endangered. However, given the new information that has become available since that last assessment and the fact that the more dramatic declines have happened outside of the three generation period (~49 years), the species now meets the criteria for an Endangered listing (representing a non-genuine change in status based on new information available since the time of the last assessment).","The Dwarf Sawfish is a shallow-water coastal and estuarine sawfish occurring on sand and mud flats, although it also occasionally penetrates upstream into rivers and has been recorded in salinities of 1–41 ppt (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2008). There is one record from over 100 km upstream in the Victoria River, Northern Territory at a salinity of 9.7 ppt (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). Thorburn <em>et al</em>. (2008) documented Dwarf Sawfish in 0.7–7 m depth, while Stevens <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded an individual reaching a maximum depth of 20 m. Reports of Dwarf Sawfish (i.e., Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011 erroneously citing Stephenson and Chidlow 2003) occurring in offshore waters are unsubstantiated.<br/><br/>Dwarf Sawfish reach at least 318 cm total length (TL), with males maturing at about 255–260 cm TL and a size at birth estimated at 60–81 cm TL (Peverell 2005, Peverell 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2008, Last and Stevens 2009, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on annuli in vertebrae, Thorburn <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated that individuals ~90 cm TL were one year old, 110–120 cm TL were ~2 years old, and ~160 cm TL were ~3 years old. Peverell (2008) estimated longevity of 34 years for Dwarf Sawfish, and an age at maturity of eight years for males. Life table models based on Dwarf Sawfish biological data from the Gulf of Carpentaria indicate an intrinsic rate of population increase of approximately 0.10 yr<sup>-1</sup>, a population doubling time of 7.2 years and generation time of 16.4 years (Moreno Iturria 2012). <br/><br/>Like other sawfishes, the Dwarf Sawfish is viviparous, with pupping thought to be during the northern Australian wet season (roughly November to April) (Peverell 2005). Litter size of the Dwarf Sawfish is unknown (Last and Stevens 2009), but is assumed to be similar to other <em>Pristis </em>species (for example Largetooth Sawfish <em>P. pristis</em>, range 1–13, mean 7.3 pups per litter; Thorson 1976). Estuarine waters have been suggested to be nursery areas for the species, with juveniles remaining for at least three years (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>A movement study with acoustic telemetry in Western Australia revealed that Dwarf Sawfish occupy a restricted area of habitat within a few kilometres of the coast, resting during the high tide in inundated mangrove forests, and moving out onto the subtidal mudflats at low tide (Stevens et al. 2008). Tracked individuals occupied shallow depths of 0–2 m, moving up to 10 km during each tidal cycle. Individuals often returned to within 100 m of previous high tide resting sites, demonstrating the repeated use of habitat (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2008). This site fidelity was also found for Dwarf Sawfish tagged and recaptured over a three month period in Port Musgrave in the Queensland Gulf of Carpentaria. Those animals occupied shallow sand and mud habitats less than 2 m deep in the estuarine Ducie River and along the coast at the entrance to Port Musgrave (Peverell <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Like other sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Dwarf Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Datasets indicate that net fisheries account for the greatest bycatch of sawfish (all species) across northern Australia (80.2%) followed by trawling (16.6%), line fishing (9.2%) and recreational fishing (0.3%) (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dwarf Sawfish are captured by all these fishing activities (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004) and declines in Dwarf Sawfish are suspected based on the susceptibility of the species to these fishing activities that are ongoing across most of their currently-known, and relatively limited, distribution (Larson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A survey across northern Australia from Western Australia to Queensland appears to support the assertion that fishing is responsible for declines, as it found greater numbers of sawfish in areas of lower fishing pressure (both commercial and recreational) (Thorburn et al. 2003). The sustainability of Dwarf Sawfish populations in northern Australia is considered to be at high risk due to the cumulative effects of all fisheries, and the species’ low biological productivity and susceptibility to gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Surveys in the Queensland Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Fin Fish Fishery (GIFFF), a multi-species gillnet fishery, reported capture rates of Dwarf Sawfish at 0.83 sawfish/net/day, with all catches occurring in the post wet season months and in the coastal zone. Dwarf Sawfish were captured in all coastal regions of the fishery but in low and variable abundance (Peverell 2005). The GIFFF operates along the entire Gulf of Carpentaria coastline and presents a high risk to the sustainability of the species (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2010, five Dwarf Sawfish interactions were reported in this fishery, with new protected species interaction measures currently under development (DEEDI 2011a). The Queensland East Coast Inshore Fin Fish Fishery has not reported any interactions with this species (DEEDI 2011b), but this may be due to the uncertain occurrence of this species in this region or problems with identification. As this fishery would likely interact with them if they were present, this tends to support the suggestion that they are no longer present along the Queensland east coast if they had historically occurred there at all.<br/><br/>The Northern Territory (NT) commercial fishery logbook and observer data recorded 1,852 sawfish captures between 1994 and 2004, with the majority of these from the Offshore Net and Line Fishery (ONLF) (n=1,732), followed by the NT Barramundi Fishery (n=61) and the NT Restricted Bait License (n=35). None of the captures were species-specific and there is only limited observer coverage of the ONLF and barramundi fisheries (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004), and very little coverage of the bait fishing licenses.<br/><br/>The ONLF targets blacktip sharks (<em>Carcharhinus tilstoni</em>, <em>C. limbatus </em>and <em>C. sorrah</em>) and Grey Mackerel (<em>Scomberomorus semifasciatus</em>) and operates across the NT coastline using mostly pelagic gillnets in the coastal zone with bottom set gillnets prohibited (Davies 2010). Observer data suggests that catches of Dwarf Sawfish in the ONLF are very low, which is consistent with the occurrence of this species in depths less than 20 m. All observed captured sawfish have been Narrow Sawfish (<em>Anoxypristis cuspidata</em>), except for one capture of a Dwarf Sawfish (Davies 2010). Preventative strategies aimed at reducing sawfish captures in this fishery were introduced in 2004 which have seen the reported catches reduced from 50 tonnes of sawfish in 2004 to less than 1 tonne in 2006 (DEWSPaC 2011).<br/><br/>The NT Barramundi Fishery is a relatively small, inshore, mixed species gillnet fishery operating from the Queensland border in the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Western Australia border in the west. Across this area, there are closures to netting in most of the major rivers and effort in the fishery has significantly reduced over the past 30 years (from ~100,000 hundred-metre-net-days to ~20,000 hundred-metre-net-days) (NTG 2012). However, given the large inshore coastal area of this fishery and the use of gillnets, capture rates of Dwarf Sawfish are probably not insignificant. A limited observer survey in 2007 (n=40 days of fishing, representing only 0.3% of effort in that year) reported a capture rate of 0.38 Dwarf Sawfish per day with a total of 20 Dwarf Sawfish recorded and a mortality rate of 45% (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008). In contrast, observer coverage since 2009 (limited to 10–40 days per year) has not recorded a Dwarf Sawfish (T. Saunders pers. comm. 2013). Dwarf Sawfish bycatch in the fishery may be spatially or temporally patchy and more consistent observer coverage would be needed to ascertain bycatch and mortality levels.<br/><br/>In northern Western Australia (WA), Dwarf Sawfish are captured in the inshore gillnet fishery (DWA 2011). Prior to 2005 when all sawfish were protected in WA, the Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Managed Fishery was estimated to have captured 12.0–16.7 tonne (live weight) of Dwarf Sawfish annually over the period 2000–2004 (McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2005) with the proportion of the catch that was landed unknown. Assuming an average individual weight of 12 kg (based on numbers and weights provided in Table 5.9 of McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2005), the above live weight equates to 1,000–1,391 individuals annually over the period 2000–2004. In 2010, the catch of sharks and rays had dropped significantly with a total of 1.3 tonne of all sharks and rays reported (DWA 2011). Dwarf Sawfish has been identified as one of the least sustainable species in this fishery (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The target shark fishery in northern WA uses pelagic gillnets and demersal longlines and operates offshore. It has been reported to capture Dwarf Sawfish, but the effort is limited, the fishery is almost inactive and it does not currently represent a threat to this species (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007, DWA 2011).<br/><br/>The Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), which operates across northern Australia, interacts with Dwarf Sawfish but possibly rarely, with only two captures reported over five years of research and commercial observer surveys (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004). Commercial logbook records from 2008 reported 458 sawfish interactions, though this is considered an under-reporting of interactions and as it was for all sawfish species, the proportion that were Dwarf Sawfish is unknown (DSEWPaC 2011). In a risk assessment of the NPF, all sawfishes, including Dwarf Sawfish were amongst the least sustainable elasmobranchs, due to a combination of their susceptibility to capture and resultant mortality, and their limited ability to recover after depletion (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The extent to which recreational fishers interact with Dwarf Sawfish across northern Australia is unknown, but there are records of recreational interactions in even relatively remote locations such as the Keep River estuary of the NT. In some areas where the species has been recorded, for example, Darwin Harbour and the South Alligator River estuary in the NT, recreational fishing is a popular activity, which is increasing in popularity and could pose a threat to the species. In the Fitzroy River (WA), recreational fishers have been reported killing incidentally caught Largetooth Sawfish (<em>P. pristis</em>) for the ‘trophy’ rostrum and as Dwarf Sawfish also occur in this region they may also be at risk (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Sawfish (non species-specific records) have been recorded in derelict fishing nets in northern Australian waters; the Gulf of Carpentaria is a particular hotspot for these ‘ghost nets’ (Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2010) and capture in these may result in sawfish mortality. Because of their toothed rostrum, sawfish may be exceptionally susceptible to entanglement in other types of marine debris, and entanglement has been reported in a number of types of marine debris (Seitz and Poulakis 2006). Entanglement in discarded or lost recreational fishing line may occur on occasion, as has been documented for other sawfish species in Australian waters (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2004), but this is considered to be a relatively minor threat to Dwarf Sawfish.<br/><br/>Historically, there have been foreign fishing vessels in Australia’s northern waters, though most of these operated offshore and were not likely a threat to Dwarf Sawfish. An exception may have been Soviet trawlers that operated throughout the nearshore waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria and northwestern WA. They fished between 1966 and 1978 and were reported to capture sawfish, though there is no species-specific information (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Across northern Australia, habitat degradation is not a major threat to Dwarf Sawfish as it occurs across relatively remote and unpopulated areas (Peverell 2005). Mining activities, through habitat alteration or potential pollution events, may however affect populations.<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, in the historical Indo-West Pacific distribution of Dwarf Sawfish, fishing pressure on the coastal zone is high, as is the exploitation of elasmobranchs. Unregulated and unmanaged fisheries, and habitat loss and degradation all threaten sawfishes across the region. Considerable population declines and localised extinctions have been reported for sawfish species throughout the Indo-West Pacific and if Dwarf Sawfish persist outside of Australia, the outlook for any remnant populations is not likely to be good.","A lack of any confirmed records outside of Australia since the 1800s implies that the global population has undergone a significant decline and range contraction; sawfishes have been seriously depleted in places such as eastern Indonesia, Borneo and India. Despite uncertainty regarding the extent of the species’ wider historical range, it can be considered ‘possibly extinct’ outside of Australia with the disappearance of the species probably occurring outside of the last three generation period (pre-1960s; considering that there are no confirmed records since the 1800s).<br/><br/>All sawfish species have undergone significant, albeit largely unquantified, declines in Australia. In places, viable populations persist, representing some of the last viable populations in the Indo-West Pacific, with Australia being one of a limited number of global strongholds for sawfish (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005, DSEWPaC 2011).<br/><br/>The current population size and historical abundance of Dwarf Sawfish is unknown. Species-specific data to accurately ascertain the status of Australian sawfishes is generally lacking and the evidence for decline and range contraction is largely anecdotal. Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program, which operates ‘bather protection’ fishing gear along the Queensland east coast, shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 30 year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern Queensland (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). All <em>Pristis </em>species are now extremely rare along the Australian east coast (the area in which human population pressure is greatest) where they have undergone a considerable range contraction. However, given the uncertainty about its occurrence on the Queensland east coast, whether this contraction applies to Dwarf Sawfish is questionable. This species is considered to be rare in both the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Northern Territory (Peverell 2005, Last and Stevens 2009, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, recent surveys in an estuarine area of the Northern Territory that has been closed to commercial fishing for over 20 years suggest that such areas may support relatively high densities of this species (P. Kyne unpublished data).<br/><br/>Genetic data indicate low to moderate genetic diversity, with very low diversity in the Gulf of Carpentaria population. Populations in Western Australia, the northern coast of the Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria are distinct genetic stocks (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011, Phillips 2012).<br/><br/>While specific management measures are now in place in Australia, including full species protection, education of fishers about safe release practices, and fishery-specific management, threats are ongoing and there is no information to suggest that the population is recovering from previous declines. However, the extent of the decline in northern Australia is unlikely to have reached ≥80% over the last three generation lengths (~49 years). Declines of 50-80% are inferred from capture in continuing commercial fisheries, with the Dwarf Sawfish particularly susceptible given its restricted inshore occurrence and relatively limited global range.",Decreasing,"<p></p>Dwarf Sawfish may now be restricted to tropical northern Australia in the Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean. The species is known to occur from the Pilbara coast of northwestern Australia through the Kimberley region and the Northern Territory to at least the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland (Compagno and Last 1999, Last and Stevens 2009). Historically it may also have occurred on the northeastern coast of Queensland as far south as Cairns, but there are no verified records, either recent or historic, to confirm this (S. Peverell pers. comm. 2010, DSEWPaC 2011). The Kimberley and northern Pilbara represent a globally significant area for Dwarf Sawfish (Thorburn <em>et al</em>. 2008, Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>There has been a long suspicion that the Dwarf Sawfish could have had a more widespread distribution in the Indo-West Pacific (Last and Stevens 1994, 2009; Compagno and Last 1999), but this has just been confirmed by the recovery of historical museum records (from the 1800s) from scattered Indo-West Pacific locations. Verifiable historic records are restricted to: Papua New Guinea (specimen held in the Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum – Naturalis, Leiden, collected in 1828); Calcutta, Bay of Bengal, India (The Natural History Museum, London, collected in the 1840s); and, Indonesian Borneo (Zoologisches Museum der Humboldt Universität Berlin, Germany, collected in 1894) (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other museum records include Réunion, non-specific locations such as the ‘West Pacific’ and the ‘Indian Ocean’, and rostra from Malaysian Borneo and Java, Indonesia (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). There are no recent records from outside of Australian waters <br/><br/>A possible Dwarf Sawfish (poor photographs preclude accurate identification) landed at a port on the Musandam Peninsula of eastern Arabia (possibly Khasab, Oman; photographs posted 26 January 2006) could have been caught in the easternmost Persian (Arabian) Gulf, the Gulf of Oman, or even the northwestern Arabian Sea (A. Moore pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>It is possible that the species persists outside of northern Australia, but its wider status is unknown. As currently known, Dwarf Sawfish may now have the smallest known range of any sawfish species.<br/><p></p>","The Dwarf Sawfish is protected within Australian waters (since 2009) and therefore commercial and recreational use and trade is prohibited. Historically, rostrums have been collected and traded as curios. For example, Morgan <em>et al</em>. (2011) examined some 141 Dwarf Sawfish rostrums donated from private collections in Western Australia. It is likely that the retention of rostrums sometimes still occurs when the species is taken incidentally. Sawfish fins are highly valued in the international fin trade and fins of the Dwarf Sawfish were very likely traded prior to the banning of shark finning in all Australian waters (Rose and McLoughlin 2001). Prior to their listing on&#160; Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), live Dwarf Sawfish were collected for aquarium displays (DSEWPaC 2011).<br/><br/>The meat of sawfish is sometimes utilised by Indigenous communities but the extent to which Indigenous Australians harvest and utilise Dwarf Sawfish is unknown; it is likely localised and at a low rate. There are also anecdotal reports of Indigenous people purchasing sawfish rostra off commercial fishers, painting and then selling them (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, in the historical Indo-West Pacific distribution of Dwarf Sawfish, exploitation of elasmobranchs is high (e.g. India, Indonesia) and sawfish have been utilised and traded for meat, fins, oil and rostrums. See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"Within Australia, Dwarf Sawfish has the following conservation and protected status listings: Australian Commonwealth waters, Vulnerable (<em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</em> 1999); Queensland, Protected (<em>Fisheries Act </em>1994); Northern Territory (NT), Vulnerable (<em>Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act </em>2000); Western Australia (WA), Totally Protected (<em>Fish Resources Management Act</em> 1994). The take of the species is therefore prohibited within Australian Commonwealth, state and territory waters. Dwarf Sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), prohibiting any international trade in the species (Dwarf Sawfish were collected for the aquarium trade prior to this listing and exported; DSEWPaC 2011).<br/><br/>In addition to the above legislated regulations, the Commonwealth, Queensland, NT and WA all have fisheries management plans in place for interactions with protected species, including Dwarf Sawfish. These include mandatory reporting of interactions with these species, release of live animals, observer coverage of most of the fisheries (although this is very low in state and territory fisheries which are likely to interact with Dwarf Sawfish) and education programmes for fishers on identification and ways to minimise interactions with this species. The Queensland Government has published a guide to the safe release of sawfish for commercial fishers (DEEDI 2010) and the NT shark fishers have a Code of Practice for the release of live sawfish from gillnets (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Several spatial closures in riverine, estuarine and coastal waters in the NT Barramundi Fishery, offer Dwarf Sawfish some refuge from commercial gillnet fishing activities in the NT. Similarly, spatial closures in important sawfish habitat areas of Port Musgrave and the Wenlock River in the Queensland Gulf of Carpentaria offer some protection (DEEDI 2009). Closed areas within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the closure of rivers in Princess Charlotte Bay to gillnetting would afford protection to Dwarf Sawfish if they occur on the northeastern Queensland coast. Seasonal spawning closures for the take of Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) throughout much of the range (mostly during the summer wet season) add a level of protection to the species, however, information on Dwarf Sawfish long-term movement patterns and habitat use are required in order to assess the benefits of closed areas and seasons not specifically designed for sawfish.<br/><br/>In the prawn trawl fisheries (Northern Prawn Fishery and Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery), the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) is mandatory, though the benefit of these devices on sawfish is poorly quantified. In a Northern Prawn Fishery study, they have been shown to reduce the catch of Narrow Sawfish (<em>Anoxypristis cuspidata</em>), however, they and other sawfish species are still being caught as their rostra become tangled in the body of the net (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Outside of Australia, awareness needs to be raised, and regulations put in place to protect all sawfishes and promote population recovery. While sawfishes (Largetooth <em>P. pristis</em>, Narrow and Green Sawfish <em>P. zijsron</em>) are theoretically protected in India (Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act), threats continue with little beneficial management, although increasing awareness of sawfishes in India is encouraging.","",,false,false,Global
143838562,98471289,Clupeonella engrauliformis,Endangered,A2bde,2018,2018-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Clupeonella engrauliformis</em>&#160;is a marine, schooling species endemic to the Caspian Sea, specifically from the middle and southern regions. Given that this species is known to reach maturity at around 2 years old and has a maximum longevity of 8 years, its generation length was estimated to be between 4–5 years. Prior to the 2000s, species of <em>Clupeonella</em> (or Kilka, i.e., <em>Clupeonella engrauliformis, C. grimmi</em>, and <em>C. caspia</em>) were considered the most abundant fishes in the Caspian Sea and contributed to the most commercially important fisheries; this species in particular, made up 70–80 % of total Kilka landings. More recently (2000–present) this species has suffered from fishery collapse and severe population declines, similar to <em>C. grimmi</em>. In addition to overfishing, the population faces a series of pervasive threats, as sea level rise and invasive species, which has been shown to alter the relative abundance of the three species of Kilka in the Caspian Sea. Where data are available, sharp declines have been depicted in the total biomass, spawning stock biomass, annual landings and CPUE of this species throughout its range. For example, trends in current CPUE from Iran were extrapolated to the present using an exponential regression based on past CPUE data (1995–2011). Based on this estimation, current CPUE is suspected to have declined by approximately 98.2–99.3 % within three generation lengths (12–15 years). Declines in annual landings of this species from Iranian waters have also been calculated using current catch data. This species decreased from 45,600 tonnes (~80% of total Kilka landings) in 1996 to about 600 tonnes (~3% of total Kilka landings) in 2017. Over the most recent three-generation length time window of 12–15 years (from 2003– or 2006–2017), catches are represented by a decline of 68–92%. However, there is some evidence suggesting a shift in the spatial distribution of fishing vessels in the Caspian Sea that may have resulted in a decline in fishing effort for this species (i.e., fleets are now fishing closer to shore and there has been a decline in fishing vessels targeting this species); it is plausible that some of the decline in landings of this species in Iran could be attributable to declines in effort. Therefore, it is conservatively suspected that population declines for this species in Iran have exceeded 50% over the past three generation lengths. Despite the lack of available quantitative data outside of Iran, there is no reason to suspect that the situation is any better elsewhere in the Caspian Sea. It is therefore suspected that the anchovy Kilka has experienced a global population decline at least exceeding 50% over the past three generation lengths, which qualifies this species for Endangered under criterion A2bde. Immediate coordinated international effort is recommended in order to implement swift and necessary management of this species within the Caspian Sea.","<em>Clupeonella engrauliformis</em>&#160;is a marine, schooling species endemic to the Caspian Sea. This species mainly occupies open sea areas but occasionally approaches the shore. It forms large concentrated schools where the water depth exceeds 30 m and is typically found in the upper water layers but may descend to 120 m (Janbaz <em>et al.</em> 2012, Coad 2017). This species can tolerate salinities ranging from 8–14 ‰, but is  mostly found in areas with higher salinities (i.e., 10–12 ‰: Coad  2017). This species overwinters in the southern Caspian sea and extends north  into the central and northern Caspian in the Spring to feed. Sexual maturity is attained around age 2 (Coad 2017) and breeding takes place from April to November but mostly in July (Whitehead 1985). The sex ratio varies with season; females dominate from January to June  and males were more abundant from September to November (Coad 2017). This species is known to have a maximum longevity of up to 8 years (Coad 2017) and grows to a maximum standard length of 15.5 cm, though usually only found between 11.5 and 12.5 cm (Whitehead 1985). Given the maximum known longevity (8 years) and the age at maturity (2 years) of this species, the generation length was estimated to be 4–5 years. <br/><br/><br/><strong></strong>","This species, similar to the other species of <em>Clupeonella</em>, has suffered severe declines in recent years and faces several distinct threats, including impacts from invasive species, fishing pressure and habitat changes (i.e., increased sea level). The accidental introduction of the comb jelly <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi </em>from  the Azov-Black Sea Basin in 1999 is a major threat to this  species as they compete for the same food and <em>M. leidyi </em>also consumes the eggs of this species (Kideys  2001, <span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Shiganova <em>et al.</em> 2004, Mamedov 2006, Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2017). <span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">This  species was the first Kilka to suffer from the introduction, which was  the main commercial species for all Caspian countries (Shiganova <em>et al. </em>2004).           Mamedov (2006) reported that the arrival of <em>M. leidyi</em> resulted in a  decreased biomass of zooplankton, the main food resource of this species  of <em>Clupeonella</em>, which dropped by a factor of 4 - 10 between 2000 and 2003. It has been suggested that the reason for the 2005 stock collapse is primarily  due to the invasion and spread of this ctenophore species (<em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>)  but that over-fishing and other factors also contributed to the crash (Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2007, Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Aliasghari <em>et al.</em> 2017). Sea level rise and increased freshwater output from the Volga River has  also been attributed to depleted abundances for this species (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;2017).<br/><br/><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><br/><a name=""_msocom_1""></a></span></span></span></span>","<p><strong><u>Status of Kilka in the Caspian Sea </u></strong></p>  <p>The majority of fisheries landings in the Caspian Sea are attributable to Kilka, the most abundant fishes in the region (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009) which includes <em>Clupeonella caspia, C. engrauliformis</em> and <em>C. grimmi</em>. Historically, the majority of Kilka landings were represented by <em>C. engrauliformis</em>, with less than 20% in contribution by <em>C. caspia</em> and <em>C. grimmi </em>(Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Janbaz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Falahatkar 2015, Coad 2017). Annual harvest of total Kilka catch has shown some fluctuations over time, but overall show a declining trend with evidence to support overexploitation from a majority of its range, including Iran (Fazli and Taghavi 2013) and Azerbaijan (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007). </p>  <p>Globally, lumped landings of species of <em>Clupeonella</em> are reported to the FAO in appreciable quantities (averaging roughly 256,000 tonnes per year); however, we have been unable to determine the precise extent this species is included in reported landings. Annual catch of three clupeoid species including <em>Clupeonella engrauliformis</em>&#160;reached a maximum of 423,000 metric tons in 1970, which accounted for roughly 70% of the total fish catch in the Caspian Sea. Overexploitation and the expansion of the invasive ctenophore, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, in the early 2000’s resulted in major declines in total biomass and catch of Kilka, as well as a change in the relative abundance of the three species (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Fazli <em>et al. </em>2007, Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p>For example, total catch in 1999 peaked at 271,400 tonnes and fishing mortality reached 1.8 y<sup>-1 </sup>indicating overexploitation (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007). </p>  <p>Additionally, more recent studies from Iran indicate that <em>C. caspia</em> is now considered to be the most common Kilka in the Caspian Sea, &#160;accounting for 87% of catches, whereas this species (previously the most abundant) recently represented roughly 8–9% and <em>C. grimmi</em> represented 1.6% (Karimzadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010, Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012).</p>  <p>Furthermore, biomass of all species of <em>Clupeonella </em>declined by a factor of three in Russia, Iran and Azerbaijan between 2000 and 2001, with larger declines seen in 2002 (Shiganova <em>et al. </em>2004).<strong> </strong>By 2002, <em>M. leidyi</em> reached critical biomass levels in important commercial areas jeopardizing fishing industries in the Caspian Sea, including <em>C. engrauliformis</em>, which was the main commercial fishery for all Caspian countries (Shiganova <em>et al.</em> 2004).<strong> </strong><em>Clupeonella </em>abundance in Iranian waters declined from roughly 10–15% to 0–2% and fisheries collapsed by approximately 50% in 2–3 years following the introduction (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Coad 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Azerbaijan</strong></p>  <p>In Azerbaijan, total Kilka catches declined from 18,500 to 5,100 tonnes (2000 – 2004) representing a 72% decrease in 5 years (Mamedov 2006). Recruitment failure in 2001 has been attributed to the invasion and spread of the ctenophore <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi </em>(Daskalov and Mamedov 2007) and resulted in an increase in the average age of the stock and a large decline in total abundance (Mamedov 2006). </p>  <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>  <p>The vast majority of available data regarding the status of Kilka in the Caspian Sea refer to Iranian waters, which likely represents less than 50% of all Kilka in the Caspian Sea. However, there is no reason to believe that it is not representative of the entire region. Since 1996, total landings of Kilka in Iran have declined from 57,000 to 27,602 tonnes in 2017, representing an approximate 60.3% decrease (Iranian Fisheries Organization <em>unpublished data</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>Additionally, changes of biological characteristics of all species of kilka, especially <em>C. engrauliformis, </em>were reported in areas impacted by <em>M. leidyi </em>(Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012) including a sharp decrease in weight, length and condition of individuals (Shiganova <em>et al. </em>2004). </p>  <p></p>  <p><strong><u>Specific information regarding the status of the anchovy Kilka, <em>C.engrauliformis</em></u></strong></p>  <p><strong>Azerbaijan</strong></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>A study using an integrated catch-at-age analysis based on commercial catch of this species indicated a sustainable fishery from 1991 to 2000 with relatively good recruitment and a high spawning-stock biomass (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007). However, poor recruitment was noted in 2001 from competition and predation of <em>M. leidyi</em>, and has reportedly remained at a low level since then (Daskalov and Mamedov 2007).</p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>Fazli <em>et al. </em>(2012) indicated that the population status of this species in Iranian waters is in critical condition. Overexploitation and the introduction of<em> M. leidyi</em> in 1999 resulted in major reported declines in biomass, catch and CPUE of <em>C. engrauliformis</em> in Iranian waters. For example, the total biomass and spawning stock biomass showed a declining trend (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2012); biomass declined from about 186,000 tonnes in 1996 to less than 12,000 tonnes in 2004 (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2007) roughly representing a 94% decrease in 9 years. Fazli <em>et al. </em>(2009) indicated that overfishing (especially between 2005 and 2008) is the main reason for the most recent collapse of this species’ fisheries. </p>  <p></p>  <p>CPUE data are not available for the entire range of the current three generations (12–15 years, based on age at maturity = 2 and maximum longevity = 8); however CPUE information is available until 2010 (Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013) and current annual landings data are available (Iranian Fisheries Organization 2017). Catches of this species increased from 1995 to a peak in 1999 at 67,000 tonnes (Iranian Fisheries Organization 2017); during this time CPUE (in tonnes per vessel per night) remained relatively constant (2.92–3.52: Fazli <em>et al. </em>2012). After the introduction of <em>M. leidyi </em>(1999), catch and CPUE declined while effort increased until 2001 (Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013). Acceptable biological catch (ABC) was estimated at 2,190 metric tonnes in 2004; however, in 2005 the catch was more than twice the estimated ABC (~4,300 tonnes) indicating overexploitation (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Iranian Fisheries Organization 2017).<strong> </strong>In 2008 the catch declined to 450 tonnes; the proportion of catches of this species dropped below 1% relative to other species taken in 2009 (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2012). Catches continued to sharply decline to about 83 tonnes in 2011 with a CPUE of 0.01 (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2012, Iranian Fisheries Organization 2017). Given the lack of current CPUE data (most recent estimate from 2011), the available data was extrapolated to the present using an exponential regression. Based on this estimation, it is suspected that declines exceed 95% over three generation lengths, which would qualify <em>C. engrauliformis</em> for Critically Endangered under criterion A2 in Iran.&#160; </p>  The only current data available within the most recent 10–15 years are annual landings data from Iran. Anchovy Kilka decreased from 45,600 tonnes (~80% of total Kilka landings) in 1996 to about 600 tonnes (~3% of total Kilka landings) in 2017 (IFSRI <em>unpublished data</em>). Since the lowest catch in 2011, catches have increased slightly in recent years, but remained below 200 tonnes until 2017 where the catch exceeded just over 600 tonnes (IFSRI <em>unpublished data</em>). Over the most recent three generation length time window of 12–15 years (from 2003– or 2006–2017), catches are represented by a decline of 68–92%. However, there is some anecdotal evidence suggesting a shift in the spatial distribution of fishing vessels in the Caspian Sea that may have resulted in a decline in fishing effort for this species. For example, more recently a larger portion of fishing activities has taken place in shallower water zones with depths less than 50 m, where this species is less available and <em>C. caspia </em>is more available to fisheries (Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012, Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013). Additionally, the number of vessels reported to target Kilka has recently declined from ~200 boats in 2002 to ~70 boats in 2013 (Falahatkar 2015); it is plausible that some of the decline in landings of this species in Iran could be attributable to declines in effort. Therefore, it is conservatively suspected that population declines for this species in Iran have exceeded 50% over the past three generation lengths. Although quantitative data are primarily available from Iran, there is no reason to suspect that the situation is any better elsewhere in the Caspian Sea. We therefore suspect that the anchovy Kilka has experienced a global population decline exceeding 50% over the past three generation lengths, which qualifies for Endangered under criterion A2.",Decreasing,"<em>Clupeonella engrauliformis</em>&#160;is distributed throughout the Caspian Sea, specifically the middle and southern regions (Whitehead 1985, Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009). Records of this species from the Anzali Lagoon and Gorgon Bay (Armantrout 1980, Coad 2017) require verification. This species descends to maximum depths of 78 m (Whitehead 1985).","<em>Clupeonella engrauliformis </em>is fished at a large-scale commercial level throughout its range. This species is taken at night time and is caught using lift nets and fish pumps with underwater electric lights (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Azerbaijan is traditionally the most important area for commercial capture of Kilka species in the Caspian Sea (Mamedov 2006). In Iran, this species is commercially targeted; catches of all Kilka species are mainly concentrated along the Babolsar and  Anzali coasts (Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2007, Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram  2012). The exploitation rate for this species varied between 0.34 and 0.815 (1995–2004: Coad 2017); the most recent exploitation rate was calculated as 0.51 per year in 2007 (Janbaz <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Iranian waters of the Capian Sea, a relatively recent stock assessments estimate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at 44,652 metric tonnes and effort at 19.609 vessels per night (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009). Individuals ranging from 2 to 4 years old dominate fish landings in Iran (Coad 2017). In Iran, this species is commercially targeted and used in the local fishmeal industry. It is also consumed smoked, salted, canned in sauce and oil, and well as marinated, according to a traditional recipe and seasoned with fruits, herbs and vegetables (Alavi-Yegaheh <em>et al</em>. 2017).",Marine,"No known species-specific conservation measures are in place; however a relatively recent study indicated that the population status of this species is in critical condition (Fazli <em>et al.</em> 2009). In a report prepared for the Caspian Environment Programme in 2001,  suggestions of fishing limitations, lab studies and monitoring were made  as measures to combat the <em>Mnemiopsis</em> problem. Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>(2017) recommends the increased attention, effort and monitoring of population levels, fishing pressure and influence of <em>M. leidyi </em>on this species<em>. </em>Further recommendations have been made for increased coordinated international effort needed to implement immediate management of Kilka stocks in the Caspian Sea (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013).<em> </em>It has also been suggested that all catches of the three species of <em>Clupeonella </em>must be restricted during spawning periods (Fazli and Taghavi Jelodar 2013).<em><br/></em>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Given that this species is known to reach maturity at 2.5 years and has an maximum longevity of 7–8 years, a generation length for this species was estimated to be between 3.5–4 years.<br/><br/>Previously (prior to the 2000s), species of <em>Clupeonella</em> (or Kilka, i.e., <em>Clupeonella engrauliformis, C. grimmi</em>, and <em>C. caspia</em>) were considered the most abundant fishes in the Caspian Sea and contributed to the most commercially important fisheries; this species in particular, made up ~18% of total Kilka landings. More recently (2000–present) this species has suffered from fishery collapse and severe population declines, similar to <em>C. engrauliformis</em>. Additionally, the population faces a series of pervasive threats from over-fishing, sea level rise and invasive species (e.g., <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>), which has been shown to alter the relative abundance of the three species of Kilka in the Caspian Sea.<br/><br/>Where data are available, sharp declines have been depicted in the total biomass, spawning stock biomass, annual landings and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species throughout its range. For example, trends in current CPUE from Iran were extrapolated to the present using an exponential regression based on past CPUE data (1995–2011). Based on this estimation, current CPUE is suspected to have declined by approximately 89–92 % within three generation lengths (10–12 years). Declines in annual landings of this species from Iranian waters have also been calculated using current catch data. This species decreased from 10,400 tonnes (~18% of total Kilka landings) in 1996 to about 226 tonnes (~ &lt; 1% of total Kilka landings) in 2017. Over the most recent three-generation length time window of 10–12 years (from 2006– or 2008–2017), catches are represented by a decline of 21–78 %. It is important to note that declines calculated over 12 years include unusually high CPUE and reported catches (2006), therefore, the estimated decline over the most recent 10 years is thought to be a better representation of decline. However, there is some evidence suggesting a shift in the spatial distribution of fishing vessels in the Caspian Sea that may have resulted in a decline in fishing effort for this species (i.e., fleets are now fishing closer to shore and there has been a decline in fishing vessels targeting this species); it is plausible that some of the decline in landings of this species in Iran could be attributable to declines in effort. Therefore, it is conservatively suspected that population declines for this species in Iran have exceeded 50% over the past three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of available quantitative data outside of Iran, there is no reason to suspect that the situation is any better elsewhere in the Caspian Sea. We therefore suspect that the anchovy Kilka has experienced a global population decline at least exceeding 50% over the past three generation lengths, which qualifies this species for Endangered under criterion A2bde. Immediate coordinated international effort is recommended in order to implement swift and necessary management of this species within the Caspian Sea. <br/> </p>","<p><em>Clupeonella grimmi </em>is a schooling species, endemic to the Caspian Sea. This is an open water species known to inhabit deeper areas of the central and southern Caspian Sea (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009). This species rarely uses inshore areas and primarily occupies low - light areas in depths over 50–70 m, down to 450 m, with large schools down to approximately 130 m (Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>2017). Larvae remain offshore at depths exceeding 70 m (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009). It does not enter freshwater or areas of low salinity (Aliasghari <em>et al.</em> 2017). In winter this species is found mainly in the southern regions and moves to the mid regions in the spring (Whitehead 1985).&#160;Mean age of females and males is 4.09 and 3.61 years, respectively with a maximum known life span of 7–8 years (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aliasghari <em>et al</em>. 2011, Parafkandeh Haghighi and Kaymaram 2012). This species reaches maturity at approximately 2.5 years and 8.82 cm FL (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009). Given that this species has a maximum know life span of 7–8 years and reaches maturity at 2.5 years, declines should be calculated based on a 3.5–4 year generation length;  10–12 years is sufficient to represent 3 generation  lengths for this species. Reproduction occurs throughout the year but peaks in February–March (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009). This species feeds mainly on copepods but also on pelagic mysids and small fishes. This species grows to a maximum standard length of 14.5 cm but usually only to 10.5–11 cm (Whitehead 1985).&#160;</p>","<p>This species, similar to the other species of <em>Clupeonella</em>, has suffered severe declines in recent years and faces several distinct threats, including impacts from invasive species, fishing pressure and habitat changes (i.e., increased sea level).

For example, in 2004, this species constituted just 0.2–2% of total Kilka catch, which is well below their relative contribution in the 1970s when this species was the second most important Kilka and represented roughly 20% of total Kilka catch (Mamedov 2006). </p>  <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>  <p>Species-specific population data are primarily available from Iran, where <em>C. grimmi</em> has suffered severe population declines in recent years. Overexploitation and the introduction of<em> M. leidyi</em> in 1999 resulted in major reported declines in biomass, catch and CPUE of <em>C. grimmi</em> in Iranian waters. For example, estimated biomass increased from 36,900 metric tonnes in 1995 to 53,500 metric tonnes in 1998, but then declined to less than 5,900 tonnes in 2001 (Fazli <em>et al</em>. 2009), representing an 89 % decline in biomass between 1998 and 2001. Reports indicate that overfishing and the introduction of <em>M. leidyi</em> resulted in the population collapse of this species, and the similar <em>C. engrauliformis</em> in 2002 (Fazli <em>et al. </em>2009, Fazli and Teghavi Jelodar 2013).</p>  <p>CPUE data are not available for the entire range of the current three generations (10–12 years based on a known age at maturity at 2.5 years and a maximum longevity between 7–8 years); however, CPUE information is available until 2009 (Fazli 2011) and current annual landings data are available (IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>). Catches of this species reached a peak of about 18,500 tonnes in 1998 (IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>); during this time CPUE was at its highest reported value for this species at 0.87 metric tonnes per vessel per night (mt/VN: Fazli 2011). After the introduction of <em>M. leidyi</em> in 1999, CPUE fell to just above 0 by 2001 (Fazli 2011) and catches reached the lowest on record in 2002 (26 tonnes: IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>). Since the lowest CPUE in 2001 and lowest catch in 2002, total catch and CPUE have remained at low levels until 2011 (the most recent years available for CPUE data) aside from an increase in catches (1,048 tonnes) and CPUE (0.08) in 2006 only. For example, the CPUE has remained below 0.1 since the decline in 2001 (Fazli 2011); similarly catches have rarely exceeded 300 tonnes (IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>). Given the lack of current CPUE data (most recent estimate from 2011), the available data was extrapolated to the present using an exponential regression. Based on this estimate, it is suspected that CPUE has declined by 89–92 % over three generation lengths (10–12 years), which would qualify <em>C. grimmi </em>for Critically Endangered under criterion A2 in Iran. </p>  <p>The only current data available within the most recent 10–12 years are annual landings data from Iran.

Since the lowest catches in 2002, catches have increased slightly but generally remain below ~300 tonnes with the exception of 2005 – 2007 where catches were about 543, 1,048 and 385 tonnes, respectively (IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>). Using the total time series for which catches are available, total catch of this species from Iranian waters has declined by an estimated 97.8% between the years 1996–2017. Over the most recent three generation length time window of 10–12 years (from 2006– or 2008–2017), catches are represented by a decline of 21–78%. However, declines calculated over a 12 year period include the year 2006 where catches exceed the average of the most recent 15 years by an order of magnitude (IFRSI <em>unpublished data</em>). Therefore, the estimated decline over 12 years is suspected to be a conservative estimate, while the estimated decline over to most recent 10 years is thought to be more of a true representation of the population decline of this species. <br/></p><p>Conversely, there is some anecdotal evidence suggesting a shift in the spatial distribution of fishing vessels in the Caspian Sea that may have resulted in a decline in fishing effort for this species.

The most recent estimate of exploitation rate for this species is 0.26 in the south Caspian Sea in 2008 (Karimzadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Currently this species is considered to be overexploited in Iranian waters (a large proportion of its range: Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>2017) despite representing the lowest proportion of total Kilka catch (1% in 2017: Iranian Fisheries Organization <em>unpublished data</em>). In Iranian waters, individuals in the 3–4 year class dominate catches (Aliasghari <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/>In general, this species is used in local fishmeal industries of Iran.

This species is abundant in Viet Nam and was previously abundant in China. However, in general, it  is threatened by overfishing,  pollution and habitat  degradation caused by large-scale hydrological projects that have disrupted its spawning migrations and decreased survival in several areas. As such, its population  has experienced declines in parts of its range. Where data are available, declines probably exceed  75% over the past ten years (estimated to be more than three generation  lengths for this species) given that it has been nearly, if not  completely extirpated from the Geum River in South Korea and has  experienced at least a 99% decline in the Yangtze estuary. Although  these data reflect only a limited proportion of this species total  range, it is not likely to be in substantially better condition  throughout the remainder of its range given that the area is largely  characterized by heavy exploitation, industrial development and urban  expansion. Based on the documented declines in harvest, it is  conservatively suspected that the population has declined by levels at  least approaching 50%, if not more, in the past 10 years. Therefore,  this species is listed as Endangered under criterion A2bd. Improved  fisheries management and habitat protection are recommended to improve the  status of this anadromous species.","This species inhabits marine coastal waters and estuaries (Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 1988). Its maximum standard length is 20 cm (Whitehead <em>et al. </em>1988). In the Yangtze River, it migrates in the spring from marine to estuarine waters to spawn (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the Yangtze River estuary, it spawns year-round with a peak between March - August and each individual spawns only once (He <em>et al.</em> 2011). He <em>et al</em>. (2008) examined the otoliths of individuals captured in the Yangtze River and found the maximum age to be five years. It is thought that the sex ratio in the Yangtze River population is biased towards females and that males have a slower growth rate (He <em>et al. </em>2008). He <em>et al. </em>(2011) indicated that the reproductive traits of this population are likely influenced by heavy exploitation. Given the life history parameters of its congener, <em>C. nasus</em>, it is inferred that the generation length of this species is about 3 years.","In the Yangtze River, this species is experiencing threats from over-fishing (especially of juveniles), juvenile occurrence as bycatch, pollution and habitat degradation (Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004,&#160;Zhang<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005,&#160;Yang <em>et al.</em> 2006, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Yangtze estuary is greatly impacted by the largest hydropower dam in the world, the Three Gorges Dam, and the largest estuarine hydraulic project in China, the North Passage Deep Water Channel Regulation Engineering. The construction of the dam far upstream in 2003 and dredging and dumping related to the&#160;estuarine hydraulic&#160;project in 2011 changed materials delivered into the estuary, including the availability of plankton, which is the main food source for this species (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Additionally, this species was previously (1970s) present in the Geum River estuary in South Korea, but has been potentially extirpated from this river after the construction of an estuary barrage in the 1990s despite the inclusion of fish passageways (Yoon <em>et al. </em>2017).","Currently this species is abundant in Viet Nam (H. Hata pers. comm. 2017). However, in South Korea,  this species was collected in the Geum River  estuary in the early  1970s, but has not longer been found after the  construction of a  estuary barrage in the 1990s despite the inclusion  of fish passageways  (Yoon <em>et al. </em>2017). As reported in Zhang and Hua 1991, He <em>et al.</em> (2011) reported that  this species was the most abundant in late 1990s in China. However,  compared with historical data, this species has declined sharply due to  overharvesting and water pollution, especially in the Yangtze River (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the 1970s, this species was heavily exploited in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its estuary in China. Annual catches averaged 2000 tons in the 1980s, and represented almost half the total fisheries&#160;catch in the area (Zhang and Hua 1991). In the 1990s,&#160;fisheries of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City averaged 2500 tons per year (Ni <em>et al.</em> 1999). This exceeded the estimated maximum&#160;sustainable yield, which was 1417 tons (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; More recently, annual catches of this species from the Yangtze estuary have declined (99% decrease) from approximately  1000 to 8.2 tonnes in the years 2003 to 2012 (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2015), a time period thought to  exceed three generations for this species as inferred from the similar species <em>Coilia nasus</em>. Fish younger than age two dominate the commercial harvest, many of which have not spawned, or have spawned only once (He <em>et al</em>. 2008). Liang and Pauly (2017) estimated that subpopulations of this species in China have a high total mortality. <br/><br/>Population data area available from scattered localities throughout this species distribution.

There is also a small subpopulation within Ariake Bay, Japan. Given the life history characteristics of this species, it is inferred that the generation length is about 3 years. Previously (prior to 2000's), this species was abundant and commercially important in Chinese Rivers (i.e., the Yangtze and Yellow rivers); however, it has been heavily exploited in both China and Japan. In addition, large-scale hydrological projects have caused habitat  degradation, disrupted its spawning migration and decreased its  survivability in several areas. Where data  are available, declines likely exceed 75% over the past  ten years (more than three generation lengths for this species) given  that it has been listed as Endangered on the Japanese Red List  represented by a 50 - 70 % decline, and has been nearly extirpated from  both the Yellow and the Yangtze rivers. Although these data reflect only  a small proportion of this  species total range, it is not likely to be in substantially better  condition throughout the remainder of its range given that this area is  largely characterized by heavy exploitation, industrial development and  urban expansion. Based on the documented declines in harvest, as well as declines in average size of the catch and truncated age-structure, it is conservatively suspected that the population has declined by at least 50 % in the past 10 years. Therefore, this species is listed as Endangered under criterion A2bd. Improved fisheries management and habitat protection are needed to improve the status of this anadromous species.<br/><br/><strong><br/></strong>","This anadromous species inhabits coastal marine, estuarine and riverine waters (Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 1988). It spends its first year in freshwater and then enters brackish/marine waters as far as 300 km from the coast (Jiang<em> et al.</em> 2012). In Japan, it spawns in freshwater from May-August by running up the Chikugo River and eggs hatch near the river mouth (Takita 1967). Its maximum standard length is 41 cm and reaches sexual maturity at the age of 1–2 years with a longevity of 4-5 years (Yuen <em>et al</em>. 1978). Given these life history parameters, it is inferred that the generation length is about 3 years for this species.","This species&#160;is heavily exploited in both China and Japan, with near extirpation observed in the Yangtze River (Zhang<em> et al</em>. 2005) and a potential extirpation in the Yellow River (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2016). In addition, large-scale hydrological projects have caused habitat degradation, disrupted its spawning migration and decreased its survivability in the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers (Chen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015,&#160;Jiang<em> et al</em>. 2016, Liu <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The Yangtze estuary is greatly impacted by the largest hydropower dam in the world, the Three Gorges Dam, and the largest estuarine hydraulic project in China, the North Passage Deep Water Channel Regulation Engineering.

In the Yangtze River, there are both anadromous and landlocked populations (e.g., Taihu Lake: Cheng <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Previously, this species was abundant and represented an important commercial fishery in the Yellow River (Cai <em>et al</em>. 1980); however, this species is now so rare that fishers now catch only a few individuals per year and a 2008 survey failed to record this species (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2016). Declines in the Yellow River are due to exploitation and habitat degradation and modification by large-scale hydrological projects. In particular, frequent long-duration cease-to-flow events in the 1990s restricted the upstream spawning migrations of <em>Coilia nasus </em>and isolated mature adults from their preferred spawning grounds. <br/><br/>Zhang<em> et al</em>. (2005) reported the MSY as 2,062 tons in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and that its subpopulation has been nearly extirpated from the middle reaches. The study also found that the body size of this fish has decreased over time and the age structure of the subpopulation was truncated due to overexploitation. In the Yangtze River, the average harvest per boat during the fishing season decreased from 285 tons (2002) to only 1.2 tons (2010: Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). From 1998-2012, total catch declined from 208 tons to 7 tons, which represents a 97% decline over a period of 14 years. The lowest recorded catch of&#160;<em>C. mystus&#160;</em>occurred in 2011 and 2012 with 10 and 7 tons (Chen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;As a result of this decline in the river, marketed individuals are now mostly sourced from marine waters (Zhong <em>et al.</em> 2007).<strong><br/><br/></strong>Population decline data are available from scattered localities throughout this species distribution.

It inhabits rocky and coral reefs, channels between mangrove keys, and sand flats on  continental and insular shelves from the surface to 13 m depth.<br/><br/>This shark is captured in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries, which are intense and largely unmanaged throughout its range. Formerly, it was common in the Gulf of California in the 1980s, but has become rare there. For example, extensive surveys of multiple landings sites in 1998–1999 did not encounter this species.

It reaches a maximum size of 280 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Life history parameters are poorly-known, but can be inferred to be similar to the Atlantic Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>): reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous, gestation period of 5–6 months, biennial reproductive cycle, litter size up to 50 pups (mean of 34), male age-at-maturity of 10–15 years, female age-at-maturity of&#160;15–20 years (Carrier 1991, Carrier and Luer 1990, Castro 2000, Compagno 2001). Generation length is estimated to be 30 years.","This shark is captured in artisanal and commercial gillnet and longline fisheries, which are intense and unmanaged across its range. This shark has been suggested to have a medium to high susceptibility to fishing (Furlong-Estrada <em>et al. </em>2014, Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017), and its large size and slow life history suggest it is sensitive to fishing pressure. Fisheries ramped up considerably in the Gulf of California in the 1980s  and 1990s, with an increase in the number of fishers, vessels, and nets  in the water; depletion of large pelagic sharks and other species occurred, and caused fishers to turn to coastal species (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Off Mazatlan, Mexico, unmanaged gillnet and longline fisheries targeting sharks arose prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). In Nayarit, Mexico, this shark is caught in low numbers in artisanal gillnets and longlines targeting sharks (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al. </em>2005). In Costa Rica, this species is caught rarely in artisanal fisheries but  appears to remain relatively common in dive records and in protected  areas (M. Espinoza unpubl. data 2019). Across much of its Central and South American range, artisanal fisheries are ongoing and are inadequately managed. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for nurse sharks, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).","Formerly (in the 1980s), this shark was common in the Gulf of California, but it has generally been encountered at low frequency in the artisanal fishery (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches have however, become scarcer; for example, extensive surveys of multiple landings sites in 1998–1999 did not encounter this species (Bizzarro <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Guatemala, it was more common in fisheries in the past, as there are some records from the 1990s and 2000s (Ruiz-Alvarado and Mijangos-Lopez 1999, Ixquiac <em>et al. </em>2009), but there have been none recently (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Costa Rica, this shark remains common, particularly in protected areas (M. Ezpinoza unpubl. data 2019). In Colombia, there are few historic records of this species, and can be considered scarce. Artisanal fishing pressure is intense over much of its range and it lacks management. Overall, given the intense fishing pressure through most of its range, the species' apparent limited biological productivity, and its relative rarity in recent decades in some areas, it is suspected that the Pacific Nurse Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations (90 years).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Nurse Shark occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from western Baja California and the Gulf of California, Mexico to Peru (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013 [as the Eastern Pacific range of <em>G. cirratum</em>], Morales-Flores <em>et al.</em> 2015).","This shark is retained and the meat is consumed fresh or salted and dried locally, fins are traded internationally, and skins are used for leather.&#160;In Pacific Colombia, this species has a lower commercial value than other shark species (Mejía-Falla <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Marine,"There are no species-specific protections or conservation actions in place for this shark.

154802213,197276,Anguilla dieffenbachii,Endangered,A2bd,2019,2018-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii </em>is a catadromous, semelparous species with multiple life stages, and is assumed to be panmictic.&#160;These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;Ideally, the IUCN Red List criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, silver eels starting their spawning migration as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but such data sets are rarely available. Analysis conducted on fisheries and monitoring data for glass eels, yellow eels and silver eels were reviewed in the present assessment, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List criteria must be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the current best estimate of the population status.<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii </em>is endemic to New Zealand, and found on both North and South Islands, as well as Chatham and Stewart offshore Islands. <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is slow growing, and can be long-lived to a large size, dependent on environmental factors, meaning there is a reduced likelihood of reaching sexual maturity, longer exposure to threats, and increased vulnerability to certain threats (e.g. ease of capture).<br/><br/>Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data are available for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> from both the North Island and South Island, where catch is of yellow eels—there is no targeted silver eel fishery, with exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora (Beentjes and Dunn 2013, Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). On both islands, CPUE initially declined since data gathering began in 1990–91, before increases or no trend were seen in the North Island after 2002 and increases in the South Island after introduction of the Quota Management System (QMS) in 2000. The introduction of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) were believed to contribute to the CPUE increases seen in the North Island, as well as other contributors, such as low market prices, reduction in number of fishers and processing factories, increased escapement tube sizes, and voluntary non-targeting. Models have shown only a few females survive to spawn even at relatively low rates of fishing pressure, with reductions in spawning per recruit of 83% and 96.5% from unfished levels, at an annual exploitation rate of 5% and 10%, respectively (Hoyle and Jellyman 2002). As such, <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation.<br/><br/>A number of data sources have suggested a historic decline in <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>recruitment has occurred. In three coastal streams across New Zealand; Pigeon Bay, Horokiwi Stream, and Te Maari Stream, the average rate of decline in glass eel recruitment was calculated, with a conservative estimate suggesting a decline of 77% between 1980 and 2000 (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2000). Although this was based only on three streams, the positioning of them across both North and South Islands (Middle and Southern North Island, Middle South Island), suggests it would be reasonable to infer the results may represent the status across the country. For the Arahura River, models indicated a 5% per year decline over several decades (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Waikato River, sampling of glass eels in 2004 and 2005 was compared with historical catches (1970–1974) of glass eels from the same area. The proportion of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>in sampling from 2004 was 3% compared to 12% in the 1970s (Jellyman 1979, Jellyman et al. 2009). Pre-1995 recruitment data has however been reported to be unreliable (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), and the most recent data on recruitment, between 1995 and 2015, shows large fluctuations with no consistent trend, suggesting the historic decline has ceased (Jellyman 2012, Martin and Bowman 2016). Surveys conducted between 1996 and 2010 to determine size distribution of eels in New Zealand found that the proportion of elvers in smaller length classes (50–99 mm) was much lower than that of a healthy size distribution for this species (Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013). The relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it is generally agreed that it is likely that low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement. The effects of which, due to the longevity of the species, may yet to be seen (Jellyman 2009).<br/><br/>There are less data estimating the trend for yellow eel and silver eel life stages. Records collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) (in Crow et al. 2016) identified a decline in an index of relative abundance from 1977 to 2015 for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. It has also been estimated that silver eel escapement (t) has declined by 80% from levels in the 1920s to that in 2008 (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b). Studies have suggested that a substantial proportion of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>is located in reserves or rarely fished areas (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2016) but this may not have always been the case, and the protection achieved by national reserves is not absolute, due to the eventual migration to the sea (McDowall 1990). Habitat loss, resulting from wetland drainage may have also resulted in <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>population reductions. Since human settlement in the 1840s, to the mid-1970s, total wetland habitat has declined by 85%, from 670,000 ha to 100,000 ha (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). A number of sources have also estimated that anthropogenic barriers (e.g. hydro-dams) have reduced access to large areas of riverine habitat, that would otherwise be capable of supporting significant numbers of eels (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Boubée <em>et al</em>. 2008, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b, Jellyman and Harding 2012). Under the New Zealand Threat Classification Series, <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>has been assessed as ‘At Risk – Declining’ a category that is both conservation dependent and based on limited data (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is however stated that: ""The panel also notes that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise"" (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is reported that abundance of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>is stable or increasing in commercial fisheries, although there is still concern over continuing habitat degradation (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Based on available information, <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>has been listed as Endangered (EN) (A2bd). Available data suggest recruitment underwent a sharp decline from historic levels, however; there is indication that this decline has ceased, perhaps as a result of management actions. Escapement has been estimated to have declined substantially from the levels in the 1920s compared to that in 2008. Further, there has been a significant reduction in available habitat over three generation lengths (102 years). Due to the vulnerability of the species and its long generation length, discussions were had as to whether this species falls within the Critically Endangered (CR) category, but this was felt not to be warranted, at present. It is strongly advised that management actions relating to anthropogenic threats continue and monitoring and data collection is strengthened to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation.<br/><br/>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5th–9th November 2018.<br/><p></p>","<p></p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii </em>is the largest freshwater fish found in New Zealand, and arguably the largest species of the genus <em>Anguilla </em>(Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004, Graynoth and Niven 2004, Jellyman and Unwin 2017). This species is slow-growing, averaging 20–30 mm per year, and reaches a maximum size of 2 m weighing up to 50 kg, although this was more common historically (Chisnall 2000; Jellyman 2007, 2012; Jellyman and Unwin 2017). More recently, few are found at lengths exceeding 1200 mm and weights of &gt;25 kg (Chisnall 2000, Jellyman 2012). The growth rate of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> has been found to vary across habitats, with the fastest occurring in rivers with low population density and high food availability (Chisnall 2000). The fastest growth was recorded in the Waikato River hydro reserve (160 mm/year) whilst slower growth has been recorded in indigenous forest streams and high-country lakes (12 and 11 mm/year, respectively) (Chisnall 2000). In another high-country lake, Lake Rotoiti, the slowest mean growth rate was recorded at 9 mm/year (Jellyman 1995).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> has been described as an ecological generalist, due to its opportunistic feeding, and ability to inhabit a wide range of environments from estuaries to upper reaches of river systems, although this species does show preference to certain habitats (Glova <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jellyman 2012). It has previously been known to tolerate poor water quality, including low levels of dissolved oxygen and higher temperatures, although is more commonly found in stony-bottomed rivers with clear water (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004, Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013). Smaller <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, &lt;300 mm, showed habitat preferences to downstream reaches with high abundance of algae and invertebrates, with coarse sediment. For larger individuals, &gt;300 mm, substrate was an important characteristic, as well as cover e.g. debris, plant, bank, surface, but algae and invertebrate abundance were not (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2003). There is some overlap between the habitat of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> and <em>A. australis</em>, although <em>A. australis</em> is found predominantly in lowland areas (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2004, Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jellyman 2012). Juveniles of both species prefer shallow water, although <em>A. australis</em> shows preference for slow flowing water with a fine substrate, whilst <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> prefers faster flow with coarse substrate (Jellyman 2007, 2012). Large <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> prefer deep water (&gt; 1 m) with slower water velocity (&lt; 0.2 m/s) and cover in the form of banks or tree roots (Graynoth and Niven 2004). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is a nocturnal feeder, with a diet that includes a wide range of aquatic invertebrates and has also been observed to feed on small fish, including juvenile brown trout (Cadwallader 1975, Jellyman 1996 in Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Doole 2005). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> and <em>A. australis </em>show dietary overlap, so differences in habitat preference is the mechanism thought to reduce interspecific competition between the species (Sagar <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Anguilla reinhardtii</em> also shows overlap with <em>A. australis </em>and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in both life history, although more so with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in ecology (Chisnall 2000). The faster growth rate of <em>A. reinhardtii</em> may mean it is competitive with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> as a top predator (Chisnall 2000).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is catadromous, feeding and growing in continental waters before embarking on a seaward migration to spawn (Doole 2005, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008a, Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). Studies using otolith microchemistry have found <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>to exhibit behavioural plasticity in regard to life history, with an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities (Arai <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is long-lived; ages at migration differ between males and females, with males averaging 25 years, and females &gt;40 (Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013). A review by Jellyman (2007), estimated mean age of silver <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> females in various regions across the North and South Islands. Average age across the regions was 43.5, although more data were available for the South Island where growth is slower (Jellyman 2007). Eels of substantial ages at spawning migration have been recorded; in a glacial-formed South Island lake containing cool water, the mean age of maturing female <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> was 93 years, and the oldest feeding yellow <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> was over 100 years old (Jellyman 1995). Assessment of available data on generation length highlighted that factors such as longitude and latitude, sex and habitat quality can affect this metric. Thirty-four years was agreed upon after analysis.<br/><br/>Environmental variables have been shown to influence migration. Increases in rainfall and flow have been suggested as key factors. Emigration of female <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> from Lake Manapouri generally took place during large outflows (Jellyman and Unwin 2017). Although, it has been also been suggested that flow and lake level only have a weak correlation with eels caught during migration (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). Boubée <em>et al</em>. (2001) found 60% of the migrant eels arriving at Lake Aniwhenua was attributed to rainfall exceeding a cumulative total of 40 mm over three days. This study also found migrations generally began as water temperatures declined in autumn, and ended when the temperature dropped below 11°C. Such rainfall and flow triggers could be used as predictors to commence mitigation activities that would allow mature eels to proceed uninjured past barriers such as hydro-electric dams (Boubée <em>et al</em>. 2001). Migration to sea occurs within a two to three-month period for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, with male migration occurring sooner (March-April) than females (April-June) (Todd 1981 in Jellyman and Unwin 2017).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> exhibits diel vertical migration movement during its spawning migration. A study of three individuals displayed frequent dives to &gt;600 m (max. 980 m), with two individuals ascending to 150–200 m, and the other returning to depths between 1 and 10 m (Jellyman and Tsukamoto 2005). This pattern of migration was assumed to be in response to thermoregulation—eels were found to often spend time in 5–6°C water—and to avoid predation (Jellyman and Tsukamoto 2005).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is assumed to exhibit panmixia, with the genetic structure indicating derivation from a single spawning population (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012). Exact location of spawning is yet unknown, although research conducted using pop-up tags deployed on migrating females has suggested migration to tropical waters occurs, with subsequent spawning in an area lying east of New Caledonia, possibly in the south Fiji basin (Jellyman and Tsukamoto 2005, 2010). This species is believed to be semelparous, spawning only once in its lifetime before dying (Doole 2005, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Leaf-shaped are passively transported via currents back to New Zealand, a process that is thought to occur over eight to ten months (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008a, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On reaching estuaries and river mouths between August and November, larvae have metamorphosed into glass eels (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). The mean size of glass eels of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> when they recruit to the New Zealand coast is 66.8 mm (Arai et al. 2004). Environmental variables have been shown to effect glass eel/elver migrations. In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, glass eels displayed a preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C for migration, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to depress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). Elver migration into Lake Pounui was affected by seasonal rainfall, with the largest migrations occurring during the greatest seasonal rainfall, and the smallest migrations occurring at the lowest seasonal rainfall (Jellyman and Ryan 1983).<br/><p></p><em>Note: Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em>","<p></p><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em>, as with all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to;&#160;barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. For <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, other aspects of life history make this species particularly vulnerable. <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is endemic, meaning the population is reliant solely from escapement occurring from New Zealand (Jellyman 2012, Hoyle 2016). The species is long-lived, and slow-growing to a large size, with a reduced likelihood of reaching sexual maturity, longer exposure to threats, and making the species more vulnerable to certain threats e.g. ease of capture (Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013, Jellyman and Unwin 2017). Ultimately, like other temperate anguillids, the adaptive capacity of this species is seemingly being outpaced by the cumulative effect of the threats posed upon it (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Large scale commercial yellow and silver eel fisheries began in New Zealand in the 1960s (PCE 2013, Hoyle 2016, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Glass eels were experimentally caught in the 1970s, although this did not last past the 1980s as once large glass eel recruitment events are now infrequent (Jellyman 2012, Tagried Kurwie pers. comm. 2018). Most recent landings proportions from the 2015–16 fishing year showed <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> to make up around 19% of New Zealand’s total commercial eel catch (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Historically, <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>has made up a larger proportion of catch (46% in 1992-93) however this has reduced as a result of declining abundance, quotas, market demand and closed areas (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). It has been suggested that the reduction in abundance of larger eels is partly attributed to the effects of commercial fishing (Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013). Hoyle and Jellyman (2002) stated that fisheries for adult eels can severely affect the escapement for this species, and that management should be conservative. A study by Chisnall (1994) investigated the effects of fishing pressure in the Ahirau stream, an unexploited pastoral stream in Waikato, containing both <em>A. australis </em>and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. In the unexploited stream, prior to the removal of marketable sized eels, the dominant biomass was large <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, which were found largely within pools. <em>Anguilla australis</em> mainly inhabited shallower, faster flowing areas and were found in greater numbers, although in much smaller sizes, possibly due to territorial behaviour by <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> excluding <em>A. australis </em>from pools (Chisnall 1994). After the initial removal of eels, it was found that <em>A. australis </em>had a greater abundance and penetrated further upstream, and very few <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>were caught, including few elvers, showing little recovery and possibly poor recruitment (Chisnall 1994). It was concluded that commercial fishing pressure represents more of a threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>than to <em>A. australis</em>, due to their ease of capture (Chisnall 1994). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> may have previously dominated eel populations within the Waikato prior to exploitation, which has seemingly reduced the density and biomass of this species (Chisnall 1994). However, in the sites where <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>were recruited, interspecific competition favoured <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, and the density and biomass of <em>A. australis </em>was reduced (Chisnall 1994).<br/><br/>Catch of glass eels in New Zealand is illegal, and so catch reports are of yellow and, to a lesser extent, silver eels. Although not a legislative requirement, there are no targeted fisheries for silver eels in New Zealand (Jellyman 2007). This is due to capture being difficult at high flow periods when most migrate and voluntary bans among fishers to support the sustainability of the stock (Jellyman 2007). As well as this, minimum and maximum weight limits of 220 g (since 1992) and 4 kg (since 1995 for South Island and 2007 for North Island), respectively, are in place to prevent catch of migrating silver eels (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the early 1990s, there were 23 licensed eel processing factories operating, in 2012 there were only four or five remaining (Jellyman 2012). Present day fishing methods mostly involve the use of fyke nets, which are baited when targeting <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Jellyman 2012). The concern over the long-term sustainability of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>harvest, has resulted in an increase in reserve areas, reductions in TACC and changes to minimum size (Jellyman 2012, PCE 2013). Māori have frequently expressed concern that commercial fishing has compromised their own ability to harvest sufficient quantities of large eels for ceremonial purposes and in recognition of the reduced availability of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>in some areas, Māori are voluntarily not fishing their Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) for this species (Jellyman 2012).<br/><br/>Development of hydropower within the habitat of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>has been shown to have detrimental effects on the population. As this species is known to travel further inland, dams and weirs have impeded both upstream and downstream migrations, reducing the amount of available habitat (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Boubée <em>et al</em>. 2008, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b, Jellyman 2012). In present times, migrant females are more commonly found to occur in small streams or reserves, whilst they were historically derived from large rivers and lakes (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b). An extreme example comes from Lake Manapouri, home to the largest unexploited population of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Boubée <em>et al</em>. 2008, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b, Jellyman and Unwin 2018). Lake Manapouri is the largest hydroelectric scheme in New Zealand, contributing substantially to overall hydro-electric generation (Jellyman and Unwin 2018, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). Water levels in the lake are controlled by a weir, the Manapouri Lake Control structure (MLC) (Jellyman and Unwin 2018, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). When silver eels attempting to emigrate from the lake encounter outflows, entry to the power station can result in 100% mortality (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). This source of mortality, given that many eels reside in lakes with hydropower development, could be significant, and reduce spawner escapement from New Zealand (Fisheries New Zealand 2018).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is another threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>in New Zealand. Wetland drainage has resulted in a huge loss of habitat in New Zealand (Jellyman 2016). Since European settlement in the 1840s, to the mid-1970s, wetlands have been reduced from around 670,000 ha to 100,000 ha, a decline of 85% (Taylor and Smith 1997, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013; Jellyman 2007, 2012, 2016). The wetland areas that remain have been subject to other stressors, such as pollution, animal grazing and introduced plants (Taylor and Smith 1997). Although this remains a more serious threat to <em>A. australis</em>, habitat overlap with <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>means it is likely to have had some negative effect. Felling of trees for timber has also occurred, along with burning of forests for quick conversion to pasture farming (Beentjes et al. 2005, PCE 2013, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). By the 1980s, around 70% of the native forest had been lost (PCE 2013). Topsoil run-off as a result of forest clearing resulted in large scale erosion and sedimentation of rivers, detrimental effects of which are still being seen in the present day (PCE 2013). For <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, who shows preference for shade and cover under banks and tree roots, the removal of a sufficient riparian zone results in loss of refuge areas and therefore habitat (Graynoth and Niven 2004, Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013). Furthermore, the reduction in riparian vegetation also has generic detrimental effects to the ecosystem, including; reducing the buffer zone between the terrestrial and aquatic interface, reduced capability to filter nutrients from run-off, reduction in bank stabilisation causing soil erosion, and reduced entry of allochthonous material as a source of organic matter and therefore energy (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, PCE 2013, Gonzáles <em>et al</em>. 2017). This, ultimately, compromises the overall health of the river system (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The effects of farming irrigation has also been suggested to be detrimental to eels in New Zealand. Poor water quality resulting from greater concentrations of nutrients and sediment in the water has been linked to excessive plant growth and smothering of the stream bed, reducing habitat and food for eels (PCE 2013). The use of drainage for pastoral purposes means there is a requirement for drain cleaning (Jellyman 2012, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Methods include both mechanical clearing and herbicides, and personal accounts have reported that mechanical excavation leads to eels being scooped out of the water onto banks, causing direct mortality if they cannot make it back to the watercourse (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Although, drainage for pastoral purposes in more common in low-lying lands, and so may be a more serious threat to <em>A. australis </em>(Jellyman 2012). Flood pumping stations control water levels in low lying lands within catchments (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017). Impellors spin within the pump, which can cause direct mortality to eels as they attempt passage (Duirs 2017, Vaipuhi Consulting 2017, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Mortality of large eels greater than 600 mm in length has been found to be 100%, whereas smaller eels of a size less than 600 mm, is significantly lower at 12% (Vaipuhi Consulting 2017). Impacts of flood pumps may be greater for <em>A. australis</em>, as they are more prevalent in low land areas. There is, however, likely to be some threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>as a result of habitat overlap.<br/><br/>Invasive species may be another threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. Wu <em>et al</em>. (2013) described some of the effects of invasive fish on freshwater ecosystems in New Zealand. It was noted that they alter turbidity, cause shifts in invertebrate composition, reduce native macrophyte abundance, increase concentrations of nutrients, and compete with native species. Cyprinid fishes, such as common carp (<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>) and goldfish (<em>Carassius auratus</em>), were described to be known for altering the freshwater ecosystem through mobilising fine sediments, causing clear shallow lakes to become turbid. The introduction of invasive species such as those mentioned may contribute to the loss of suitable available habitat for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, particularly due to its habitat preferences (Graynoth and Niven 2004). Other introduced species, such as trout, perch, rudd, catfish, koi carp, tench and gambusia may also impact eels through competition for food and resources, as well as degrading habitat and reducing biodiversity (Rowe 2004 in Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). Competition with other eels may also pose a threat to <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>. The Australian long-finned eel, <em>A. reinhardtii</em>, utilises similar habitat and has overlapping diet with <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, and is highly competitive within its native range with a faster growth rate (Chisnall 2000). If <em>A. reinhardtii </em>becomes more common in upper reaches of catchments, where there is limited habitat for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, it is likely to compete as top predator (Chisnall 2000). This said, <em>A. reinhardtii </em>is rare in New Zealand, and so currently this threat is likely to be minimal (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions have been implicated in the decline in recruitment seen in all temperate anguillid species (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). For some species, this involves El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which have potentially been affecting spawning and recruitment of <em>A. australis</em> and <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>(Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). Alterations in surface layer characteristics (productivity/community structure) may also have occurred due to ocean warming, affecting both larval feeding and transport (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Tukituki River, Hawke Bay, New Zealand, glass eels (both <em>A. australis </em>and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) migrating upstream were found to display preference for water temperatures between 12–20°C, with an optimum of 16.5°C (August and Hicks 2008). Temperatures lower than 12°C and above 22°C were found to depress glass eel catches (August and Hicks 2008). It was therefore implied that warmer waters occurring as a result of the changing climate may be detrimental to glass eel recruitment in the native range of these species (August and Hicks 2008). In the North Island Waikato River, glass eel recruitment (both <em>A. australis </em>and <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) was also studied over a period of two years (2004–5) (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Comparison of catch results from this study with previous catch data (30 years apart), found glass eel migration periods to occur earlier in the present study, by several weeks (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). It was also found that reduced CPUE and duration of runs in the recent sampling, indicating a reduction in recruitment may also have occurred (Jellyman<em> et al</em>. 2009). One possible explanation given was that deviations were a result of climate change, as although no consistent national trend exists, fresh water temperatures in New Zealand have increased by ~1.6°C from 1989–2005 (Scarsbrook 2006 in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Glass eels sampled by Jellyman et al. (2009) were caught between temperatures of 12.6°C and 13.1°C, substantially below the 16.5°C optimum suggested by August and Hicks (2008). There was also evidence that glass eels may compensate for increased temperature through earlier seasonal migration (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). Therefore, if they were to wait for river temperatures &gt;12°C before beginning upstream migration, the time window would become limited (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). For these studies, catches in both the Tukituki and Waikato were both predominantly <em>A. australis</em>, 91–93% and &gt;97%, respectively (August and Hicks 2008, Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Eels are seen as suitable indicators of persistent organic pollutant (POP) contamination in freshwater ecosystems, due to their high lipid content, longevity and omnivorous feeding (Holmqvist <em>et al</em>. 2006). New Zealand is highly industrialised, with many potential sources of POPs, although levels of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>are the lowest found in anguillid eels worldwide (Holmqvist <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><p></p>","<p></p>A range of sources indicate a population decline for&#160;<em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em>, mainly as a result of fishing pressure, barriers to migration, and habitat degradation. The first European settlers to New Zealand found, like Māori, eels to be a largely available, abundant, easily exploitable food source (McDowall 1990). British settlers introduced trout to New Zealand waters, eventually resulting in the abstraction of eels to protect the introduced trout (McDowall 1990). Commercial fishing for eels began again both during and after the second world war, up to a peak of 2,364 t in 1975. Over time, there has been a shift from eels being an originally abundant nuisance species in New Zealand (from the perspective of European settlers), to an exploited species of high export value (McDowall 1990). In the present day, there is growing public knowledge that eels—in particular <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>—are an important part of New Zealand biodiversity (Jellyman 2014).<br/><br/>The Fisheries New Zealand ‘Fisheries Assessment Plenary’ was published in May 2018. This document is a summary of fisheries, biological, environmental, stock assessment, and stock status information for commercial fish species in New Zealand. The first available catch data (landings, tonnes (t)) of yellow, and to a lesser extent, silver eels is from 1965, although up to 1989–90 this encompassed landings of both shortfin (<em>A. australis</em>) and longfin (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>), with the latter making up ~25% of commercial eel catch (PCE 2013). Although not a legislative requirement, there are no targeted fisheries for silver eels - with the exception of silver male <em>A. australis</em> from Te Waihora) in New Zealand (Jellyman 2007). This is due to capture being difficult at high flow periods when most migrate, and voluntary bans among fishers to support the sustainability of the stock (Jellyman 2007). Australasian longfin (<em>A. reinhardtii</em>), after identification in 1996 (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 1996), has been confirmed in North Island landings, although the percentage is unknown and thought to contribute very little, so is included and managed within ‘shortfin’ (<em>A. australis</em>) stocks. Catch data prior to 1988 was also collected by calendar year not fishing season, which straddle years. Fisheries New Zealand (2018) reported general trends in fisheries landings (t) since the late 1980s within their Fisheries Assessment Plenary. From 1989–90 to 2007–08, the proportion of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in overall eel landings declined from 42% to 29%. After which, a sharp decline was seen in the next fishing season, with the proportion of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> being only 18% in 2008–09. This figure increased again to 30% in 2013–14 but has since declined to a proportion of 19% in the most recently reported record from 2015–16. Over the time scale of this data, <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> landings have undergone a decline of ~80% from 1989–90 to 2015–16. However, due to the effects of market demand, quotas, voluntary non-targeting, and fishery closures (Williams et al. 2017), it would not be accurate to infer declines solely from the landings data presented within the Fisheries Assessment Plenary.<br/><br/>Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data are available by Eel Statistical Area (ESA) (a list of which can be found in Fisheries New Zealand 2018). For North Island ESAs, robust CPUE data was analysed from Northland (ESA AA), Auckland (ESA AB), Hauraki (ESA AC), and Waikato (ESA AD), from 1990–91 to 2014–15 (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). Indices for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were found to be more variable, with wider confidence intervals than that of ‘shortfins’. Catch per unit effort of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in the North Island ESAs initially declined from 1990, followed by increases or no trend occurring from 2002—apart from Northland, where CPUE declined throughout the series (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). Catch per unit effort is now indicating a halt or reversal in the declines, although reductions in Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) in 2007–08 and voluntary reductions in Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) by iwi—the political unit of the Māori representing customary and commercial interests—prior to this, may have contributed to this (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017). Estimates of CPUE are described as being conservative following 2007 due to non-reporting of legal sized eels returned to the water, a consequence of fishers not having enough ACE to cover the catch, but also voluntarily forgoing opportunities to fulfil their ACE (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017). The increased size of fyke net escape tubes—a mechanism to allow eels under the size restriction to escape—from 25 mm to 31 mm in 2013–14 to exclude eels &lt;300 g will also have contributed to these conservative estimates (Beentjes and McKenzie 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of CPUE has also been conducted for South Island ESAs from 1990–91 to 2012–13 (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). In data poor areas (Nelson (ESA AN), Marlborough, South Marlborough (ESA AP-AQ), North and South Canterbury (ESA AR, AT), and Waitaki (ESA AU)) there was no strong consistent trend observed over the series, with the exception of Marlborough and South Marlborough where CPUE was found to decline (Beentjes and Dunn 2013). For data rich areas (Westland (ESA AX), Otago (ESA AV), Southland (ESA AW) and Te Waihora (AS1)) pre-Quota Management System (QMS) CPUE showed clear declines, apart from in Westland where CPUE increased. Post-QMS, CPUE showed increasing trends in Westland and Otago, and to a lesser extent in Southland (Beentjes and Dunn 2013).<br/><br/>Although CPUE is a better indicator of population status data are only available from areas that are fished and so may be unrepresentative of the overall population (Hoyle 2016). Graynoth <em>et al</em>. (2008b) estimated 49% of the freshwater (rivers and lakes) biomass of A. dieffenbachii was located in reserves or rarely fished areas. Another study found 35% of New Zealand <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> river habitat to be fished, with commercial fishing occurring in 27.2% of river and lake habitat accessible to A. dieffenbachii (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catch per unit effort may therefore not be the most useful metric to solely determine the overall population trend, particularly when it is difficult to determine how much unfished areas contribute to recovery for eels (Hoyle 2016). Chisnall and Kalish (1993) found 68% of marked and recaptured <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> exhibited little movement within the Ahirau Stream (North Island, New Zealand). Eels were found to remain between one and three years within the same pools or runs, possibly suggesting the contribution of unexploited areas to those that are fished may be minimal (Hoyle 2016). Models developed by Hoyle and Jellyman (2002) indicated few females survived to spawn even at relatively low rates of fishing pressure, with reductions in spawning per recruit of 83% and 96.5% from unfished levels, at an annual exploitation rate of 5% and 10%, respectively. As such, <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Dunn <em>et al</em>. (2009) investigated the feasibility of developing a population dynamics model for South Island <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> using fisheries data. Estimates suggested pre-exploitation spawning stock biomass to range between 120 and 180 t, with current spawning stock biomass to be depleted, at either 5% or between 20–25% of pre-exploitation levels dependent on the type of model used (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2000) examined the age composition of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> in freshwater, to assess annual variations in year class abundance and determine whether there had been a decline in recruitment. Samples were taken using electrofishing from three coastal streams (Pigeon Bay, Canterbury; Horokiwi Stream, Wellington; Te Maari Stream, Raglan) over three years. Abundance of size/age groups within the entire catchment were estimated and used to determine age composition and mortality rates. Annual recruitment was found to be highly variable and was unlikely to have declined at a steady rate. The average rate of decline since 1980 for all three waters (Pigeon Bay, Canterbury; Horokiwi Stream, Wellington; Te Maari Stream, Raglan) was found to be 10% per year, although a conservative 7% per year was used in subsequent graphs and models. This conservative estimate suggested recruitment to have declined by 77% between 1980 and 2000, based these waterbodies. Although this was based only on three streams, the positioning of them across both North and South Islands (Middle and Southern North Island, Middle South Island), suggests it would be reasonable to infer the results may represent the status across the country. A second data set, from the Arahura River (West Coast, South Island) was used, where electrofishing surveys were conducted in 1998. Models indicated a 5% per year decline over several decades. These declines in recruitment could seriously affect yellow eel populations and silver eel escapement that, due to the longevity of the species, could be seen for decades to come (Jellyman 2009).<br/><br/>As part of a Public Good Science Fund (PGSF) research programme on eels, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) conduced regular sampling for glass eels (Jellyman 2012). The data series ran from 1995–2006, and analysis was conducted on glass eel catches sampled at two weekly intervals during September and October (Jellyman 2012). The analysis found <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> to be less abundant than <em>A. australis</em>, although found no evidence of a decline in recruitment of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> over the period (Jellyman, 2012). This suggests the declines indicated in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. (2000) had ceased. However, the time period assessed in this paper, in comparison to the generation length of the species (34 years) is very short. It was concluded that it would be premature to assume <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> recruitment is stable, and that other studies (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009) have found evidence of recruitment declines (Jellyman 2012).<br/><br/>The Waikato River is known to have the largest glass eel recruitment of all the rivers in New Zealand (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2012). From 1970–74, trials to determine the commercial potential of exporting glass eels were conducted where fishing was carried out for four seasons (Jellyman 1979). More recently, during research to determine environmental triggers of recruitment in the Waikato during 2004 and 2005, comparisons were able to be made with the data from the 1970s (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). It was found that the proportion of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> had declined from 12% (n=10,525 glass eels) in the 1970s to 3% (n = 437) in 2004 (Jellyman 1979, Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). The migration period was found to be several weeks earlier during the studies conducted in 2004 and 2005 when compared to previous, and CPUE, duration of runs, and average catch per run were significantly reduced (Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, conclusions based on two years data must be provisional, as interannual variation in recruitment can be 10-fold (Francis and Jellyman 1999 in Jellyman <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>It has been reported that recruitment data collected prior to 1995 is unreliable (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Since 1995, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been monitoring recruitment through elver trap and transfer operations at hydro dams. Martin and Bowman (2016), estimated recruitment trends between 1995 and 2015, using the data collected from six locations: Wairua Falls Power Station, Karapiro Dam, Matahina Dam, Patea Dam, Waitaki Dam and Arnold Dam. In Karapiro and Matahina, for both <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> and <em>A. australis</em>, catch indices peaked between 2007 and 2009, underwent a sharp decline in 2011–12, before increasing in 2014–15. In the South Island, there were large gaps in data, making it difficult to discern trends. Arnold Dam showed declines in recruitment from around 2008–09, although this increased in 2014–15. Overall, catch indices have fluctuated markedly through seasons and between sites, with no consistent trend across the time series, suggesting no overall trend in recruitment (Martin and Bowman 2016). It should be noted however, that recruitment to some large rivers is is seemingly inadequate for their size (Don Jellyman pers. comm. 2019). In the North Island, on the Waikato River, the catchment area above Karapiro Dam is 4,226 km². Previously (2007–2008) this has supported 701,000 elvers, but has a recent five-year average of 134,000, compared to the long-term average of ~230,000 (1992–93 to 2014–15) (Martin and Bowman 2016). In the South Island, three out of four of the largest rivers, the Waiau, Waitaki, and Clutha, have annual recruitment of up to ~100,000 elvers annually, with only a few hundred in some years (catchment area above the dams is, 5,785 km², 7,801 km², and 12,000 km², respectively) (Martin and Bowman 2016).<br/><br/>Surveys of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> and <em>A. australis</em> were conducted between 1996 and 2010 by NIWA, as described in the report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (2013). NIWA undertook 30 surveys in 19 streams and rivers, with eels being counted, measured and subsequently divided into 50-millimetre length classes. Over 10,000 <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> were measured, and it was found that the proportion of elvers (50–99 mm) was much lower than what would have been expected given a healthy size distribution for this species (where there would be a larger proportion of small eels being present compared to larger eels) (Jellyman 2012). This reduced proportion of elvers was determined to depict a reduction in the resilience of the population, as low numbers of eels in smaller age classes will result in knock on effects to later life stages (Jellyman 2012).<br/><br/>Records from 1977–2015 collected from the New Zealand Freshwater Fish Database (NZFFD) were analysed by Crow <em>et al</em>. (2016) using a generalised linear model, to estimate the probability of capture as an index of relative abundance for each year. Two approaches were run for this analysis, one using probability of capture values only, and one that was weighted, through placing higher emphasis on observations for which there is greater confidence. Within the weighted analysis, the relative abundance of <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>declined over the complete time series, and so the unweighted analysis trend could not be inferred with confidence. The data within NZFFD records are collected country-wide, possibly suggesting country-wide trends, however, records were mostly from electrofishing, which may over-represent life stages in stream habitats accessible to this method (Haro <em>et al</em>. 2015, Crow <em>et al</em>. 2016). When looking at spawning escapement of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. (2008b) estimated escapement to be 277 t per year. This indicated a decline of around 80% in escapement since the 1920s (1,360 t), before the start of hydro-dam construction and commercial eel fishing.<br/><br/>In three of the largest rivers in New Zealand (Waitaki, Waikato, and Clutha) hydro-dam development has prevented access to 68,000 km of riverine habitat, and while not all will be suitable for eels, represents a large impact on habitat availability (Jellyman and Harding 2012). Graynoth <em>et al</em>. (2008b) used models to estimate the biomass of eels that could be supported within river habitat in New Zealand, if hydro-dams were not blocking passage. It was estimated, that hydro-dams in both the North and South Islands have impeded upstream access to water that has a carrying capacity of 6,260 t of longfin eels (Graynoth <em>et al</em>. 2008b). However, another study proposed a more conservative estimate and that major dams have reduced access to habitat with a carrying capacity of 460 t of eels in the North Island, and 1,200 t in the South Island (Boubée <em>et al</em>. 2008). Beentjes <em>et al</em>. (2016) found hydro and reservoir dams to impede access to 44% of natural lake habitat suitable for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2016). Although estimates vary and multiple metrics are used, these papers indicate that anthropogenic barriers have a substantial effect on eel migration (Beentjes <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> has been assessed as ‘At Risk – Declining’ under the New Zealand Threat Classification Series, with qualifiers ‘CD’ (conservation dependent — “The taxon is likely to move to a higher threat category if current management ceases”) and ‘DP’&#160; (data poor — “Confidence in the listing is low due to there being only poor data available for assessment”) (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2018, Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is reported that abundance of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> is stable or increasing in commercial fisheries, although there is still concern over continuing habitat degradation (Dunn et al. 2018). It is also stated within the report: ""The panel also notes that public discourse on the longfin eel portrays the species as being severely threatened despite data that indicate otherwise."" (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2018). The New Zealand Threat Classification Series defines population as “The total number of individuals that are resident or that breed in New Zealand” referring solely to mature individuals (Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2008). The difficulty with assessing an Anguillid species using this terminology, as with the IUCN classification, is that we do not have a direct metric for ‘mature individuals’, as eels are not considered mature until they reach oceanic breeding grounds to spawn. Therefore, it is necessary to assess them using the nearest closest metric. Within the New Zealand Threat Classification Series assessment, there is no indication as to what metric was used or reasoning as to why that metric was decided to be an appropriate alternative.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is a temperate species, endemic to New Zealand (Jellyman and Unwin 2017). It is found in both the North and South Islands as well as the Chatham and Stewart offshore Islands (McDowall 1990, Jellyman 2007, Jellyman and Unwin 2017). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> can travel up to 300 km inland and is distributed from sea level up to elevations of 1,150 meters, allowing individuals to inhabit high country lakes and rivers (McDowall 2000, Jellyman 2007). The spawning grounds of this species are currently unknown, although research using pop-up satellite archival tags on migrating females have suggested a tropical spawning ground, lying east of New Caledonia, possibly in the south Fiji basin (Jellyman and Tsukamoto 2005, 2010). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is assumed to be panmictic, with genetic structure indicating derivation from a single spawning population (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001; Jellyman 2007, 2012).<br/></p><p></p>","<p></p>The various life stages, ranging from juvenile to adult, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one Anguilla species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 t), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla </em>spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> juvenile eels have not been affected by these shifts in demand, however, as catch or export of glass eels from New Zealand is not permitted (apart from small quantities for research purposes), and there is no information suggesting this species is currently used (or there is interest in using it in the future) in eel farms in East Asia. Only yellow and silver <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>eels are harvested and traded globally (see below for more information).<br/><br/>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent Anguilla skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of Anguilla averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter (52% and 71% of global exports by weight and value respectively during 2006–2015) and Japan the main importer (for 54% and 72%). As noted above, a high percentage of eels in international trade are derived from eels having been grown out in farms. Trade in <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> on the other hand is wholly wild-caught eels, as there is no known farming of this species.<br/><br/>In New Zealand, eels (known in Te Reo as “tuna”) feature extensively in Māori mythology and large eels are considered spiritual guardians of waterways. To this day, eels are important to Māori for cultural reasons. In some cases they are considered a delicacy and are served at various functions. Prior to European settlement, Māori already had extensive knowledge of the ecology of eels and developed effective fisheries through combinations of traps, spearing, bait fishing and large weirs (McDowall 1990, 2011; Jellyman, 2012). The extent of current or past non-commercial take in New Zealand is unknown, however current allowances for customary and recreational take of longfin eels (<em>A. dieffenbachii</em>) as of 2018 were set at: 32.6% of TAC (46 t) in the North Island, and 21.7% of TAC (24.68 t) in South Island, for customary take. For recreational take, allowances were 22.7% of TAC (32 t) in the North island, and 6.4% of TAC (7.24 t) in the South Island.&#160; <br/><br/>Large scale commercial yellow and silver eel fisheries of domestic species began in New Zealand in the 1960s with the arrival of Dutch immigrants to New Zealand, who had both the knowledge of eel fisheries and the ability to make and use fyke nets (McDowall 1990). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is particularly vulnerable to capture using baited fyke nets, with larger eels being more likely to be caught than smaller eels (Jellyman and Graynoth 2005). The fishery grew rapidly until annual catches of 2,000 t were recorded in the early 1970s. Annual landings were relatively stable from 1983 to 2001 (~1,000–1,500 t), after which they dropped as eel stocks were progressively introduced into the Quota Management System (QMS), TACCs were reduced and international demand declined (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Over the last decade, total commercial annual catch has ranged between about 450–750 t. <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> catch has accounted for around 20–30% of this: ranging between 90 and 240 t a year (Fisheries New Zealand 2018).<br/><br/>The majority of New Zealand eel catch (&gt;70%) is exported (New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries 2018). <em>Anguilla dieffenbachii</em> is not usually exported live due to difficulties in ensuring survival; according to industry sources the main processed product is frozen chunks (of about 5 cm length, New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries 2018). According to New Zealand Customs data (which does not differentiate between species), New Zealand exported 3,636 t of frozen eels and 2,818 t of live eels during 2008–2017. Annual frozen eel exports ranged between 152 and 380 t during 2008–2017 except for 2010 when these exceeded 1,189 t with sudden increases in frozen eel exports to South Korea (926 t). Except in 2010, the main destinations of frozen eels were Belgium, the UK and Germany. Live eel exports reached a peak of 517 t in 2011, after which they declined gradually to 133 t in 2016. The main destinations of live eels were South Korea until 2013, mainland China (2014–2016) and Canada in 2017. Jellyman (2012) reported that there has been a substantial increase in the price that New Zealand eels are fetching on overseas markets, although details are scarce.<br/><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p>In New Zealand an annual meeting of the Eel Working Group occurs as part of the management process for eel fisheries. This involves Ministry of Fisheries fishery managers, iwi—the political unit of Māori representing customary and commercial interests—commercial fishers, processors, Seafood Industry Council, the Department of Conservation and research providers (Jellyman 2012). The meetings involve discussions surrounding research priorities, reviewing research outcomes as well as reviewing the annual report on eels (Ministry of Fisheries assessment plenary) (Jellyman 2012).<br/><br/>The New Zealand fishing season for all eel stocks extends from 1st October to 30th September, apart from Te Waihora/Lake Ellesmere, where since 2002 the season is 1st February to 31st January (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). A Quota Management System (QMS) was introduced to New Zealand in 1986, to control the amount of fish taken from each stock (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2019a). On 1st October 2000, the South Island eel fishery was introduced to the QMS, combining ‘shortfins’ (<em>A. australis</em> with some <em>A. reinhardtii</em>) and ‘longfins’ (A. dieffenbachii) within six stocks. The Chatham Island fishery followed, introducing the QMS on 1st October 2003, with one stock for ‘shortfins’ and one for ‘longfins’. The North Island fishery was introduced on the 1st October 2004, with eight fish stocks, four for each ‘shortfins’ and ‘longfins’ (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). On 1st October 2017 the South Island stocks were finally separated into ‘longfins’ and ‘shortfins’, to allow species specific management (Fisheries New Zealand 2018).<br/><br/>The QMS involves establishing Total Allowable Catch (TAC) (In 2018: 113.95 t South Island, 141 t North Island) for each fish stock, which is split into: Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) (In 2018: 72% of TAC (82 t) South Island, 39% of TAC (55 t) North Island), customary catch, recreational catch, and other sources of fishing related mortality (Jellyman 2007, 2012). New Zealand’s indigenous people, Māori, have been allocated 20% of commercial quota, with additional catch allocation for customary take (Jellyman 2007, Williams et al. 2017). Quota shares generate a certain amount of Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE), which does not necessarily have to be fished by owners themselves and can be sold to other licensed fishers that may or may not own quota. The proportion of the TAC given as customary allowance is different for both North and South Islands and can vary in different years as a result of adjustments made after reviews. The current customary allowance for the North Island is 32.6% of the TAC (46 t) after cuts to the TAC/TACC were made on 1st October 2018, although this varies within each Quota Management Area (QMA) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019c). In the South Island the customary allowance is 21.7% of TAC (24.68 t), with the proportion again varying by QMA (values for TAC, TACC, cust. allowance, and rec. allowance for each North and South Island QMA can be found: Ministry for Primary Industries 2019d) (Ministry for Primary Industries 2019d).<br/><br/>Minimum and maximum commercial size limits (220 g from 1992 and 4 kg from 1995 for South Island and 2007 for North Island) are in place for anguillid eels throughout New Zealand (Jellyman 2012). In 2005, Mohaka, Motu and most of the Whanganui River catchments were closed to commercial fishing (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). In the Waikato-Tainui rohe region in 2014, bylaws were introduced to limit minimum harvest sizes to 300 g for ‘shortfins’ and 400 g for ‘longfins’, with an upper limit of 2 kg for both (Fisheries New Zealand 2018), to prevent the take of migratory females. There was also the addition of seasonal closures in some reaches as a result of the introduced bylaws (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). Across New Zealand, there is a recreational daily bag limit of six eels, introduced in October 1994 (Fisheries New Zealand 2018). A fisher agreement also exists, whereby commercial fishers have voluntarily agreed to not land A. dieffenbachii in Lake Ellesmere (Te Waihora), or any ‘longfin’ migratory female (or eel over 4 kg) (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ministry for Primary Industries, 2019b). Commercial fishing in New Zealand is also banned in National Parks and Scenic Reserves, and often on the Crown Estate (managed by the Department of Conservation).<br/><br/>In April 2018, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Department of Conservation developed the “New Zealand fish passage guidelines: for structures up to 4m” in partnership with the New Zealand Fish Passage Advisory Group (<a href=""https://www.doc.govt.nz/"">Doc.govt.nz</a> 2018, Franklin et al. 2018). The document outlines recommended practice for the design of instream infrastructure to provide for general fish passage and sets foundations for improved fish passage management, although it makes some reference to eels specifically (Doc.govt.nz 2018, Franklin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Other management developments have included enhancement of upstream waters with juvenile eels (although where this takes place upstream of hydro dams, escapement still remains an issue), setting aside additional reserve areas to increase escapement of silver eels, and increased management involvement of Māori (Jellyman 2007).<br/><br/>Since 1982/3 assistance of upstream elver passage over hydro-dams has occurred in New Zealand, and ‘trap and transfer’ methods are used to help improve the state of eel populations above these structures (Boubée et al. 2008). Lake Manapouri in the Waiau River catchment operates the largest hydropower station in New Zealand (Jellyman and Unwin 2018). To provide safe downstream passage for silver eels, Meridian Energy Ltd.—the power company responsible for the Manapouri Lake Control structure—are required to operate a ‘trap and transfer’ and monitoring programme, whereby silver eels are caught in the lake and transferred downstream of the obstruction to allow access to the sea (Jellyman and Unwin 2018, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2018). Methods allowing for downstream movement include netting eels in headraces, and opening spillway gates at critical times, such as at the Patea Dam in Taranaki, where spillway gates are opened for an hour after sunset following heavy rain when mature eels are likely to migrate (PCE 2013). Māori have also practised various forms of management, named “rāhui”, which has included imposing fishing bans on waterways for ceremonial or conservation reasons and seeding areas with small eels (Jellyman 2012).<br/><br/>As well as this, iwi have voluntarily refrained from catching their Annual Catch Entitlement (ACE) for <em>A. dieffenbachii</em>, or made it available for use by others, a practise that has occurred for several years (Joshua Baller - Te Wai Māori Trust, pers. comm. 2019). Graynoth <em>et al</em>. (2008b) estimated that, at time of publication, 7% of <em>A. dieffenbachii</em> biomass occurred in water closed to commercial fishing, allowing safe migration of females. Water protected in the upper reaches held 17% of biomass (although fishing could still occur downstream) and a further 25% was located in rarely fished small streams. Overall, Graynoth <em>et al</em>. (2008b) estimated that 49% of the biomass was located in reserves or rarely fished areas. A study by Beentjes <em>et al</em>. (2016) found only 27.2% of river and lake habitat accessible to <em>A. dieffenbachii </em>to be commercially fished. The proportions varied depended on island, with 32.5% in the South Island, and 22.5% in the North Island. It has, however, been argued that the protection achieved by national reserves is not absolute, due to the eventual migration to the marine environment, where the species becomes again accessible to exploitation (McDowall 1990).<br/><p></p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

It is taken in nearshore fisheries where the level of exploitation is very high, but the impact on this species is not currently quantified. Anecdotal evidence from monitoring the catch&#160;of these fisheries indicates that catch has declined over time due to overfishing. In addition, the nearshore habitat quality of this area may be impacted by a mining industry that is fixed directly on the shore. Overfishing is considered a major threat, and justifies this species occurring in only a single location as defined by the Red List methodology.&#160;Therefore, this species is listed as Endangered B1ab (iii,v). Development of fisheries management and data collection is highly recommended, as well as dedicated biological studies on this species and environmental research on water quality in the area.","This is a demersal species that inhabits sandy beaches and nearshore sandy bottoms.

The level of fishing effort for nearshore fishes such as this is very high throughout the area that this species is restricted to (C. Maunde and F. Uiblein pers. comm. 2019). Due to the lack of species-specific fisheries data in Mozambique, its population status is poorly understood, but anecdotal observations of catch declines in the intensive nearshore fisheries of Angoche are known.

It is usually found within a narrow band of shallow coral reef habitat and soft bottom that is heavily fished throughout all of its range except Australia. It is taken in inshore fisheries (demersal trawls, floating and fixed bottom gillnets and baited hooks) and regularly seen in fish markets in Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Pakistan, India, Taiwan, and elsewhere. There are limited data on population declines in these areas, with the exception of the Gulf of Thailand, but the species is susceptible to capture in a wide range of fisheries, has a narrow habitat range with potential limited dispersal, shows strong site fidelity and forms aggregations which facilitate the rapid removal of individuals.<br/><br/>Population genetic analysis supports two subpopulations of the Zebra Shark: Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian and Eastern Indonesian-Oceania. The greatest levels of exploitation and ongoing threats for this species occurs in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand through to Indonesia. Given little or no genetic exchange from unexploited areas it is suspected that this subpopulation has declined by at least 50% over the last three generations (51 years) and these threats are suspected to continue at these levels into the future. Therefore the Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian subpopulation is considered Endangered.&#160;The Eastern Indonesian-Oceania subpopulation is composed of regions with minimal exploitation to this species as well as regions of greater fishing pressure and habitat threats. In particular, the Zebra Shark in Australian waters is considered Least Concern due to minimal impacts from fishing, non-consumptive exploitation and habitat loss. However, population genetic and tracking studies suggest there is likely to be exchange between Australian waters and the Arafura Sea in Eastern Indonesian waters where extensive trawl fishing occurs and has been increasing in intensity over the last 30 years. Based on the ongoing fishing and habitat threats posed by these trawl fisheries in the Arafura Sea and the potential impacts on Zebra Sharks migrating from adjacent regions, reductions of at least 20% of its population size within three generations (51 years) are suspected and the Eastern Indonesian-Oceania subpopulation is assessed as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>By combining the subpopulation assessments according to relative area (the&#160;Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian subpopulation has approximately 70% of the available habitat; the Eastern Indonesian-Oceania subpopulation has&#160;approximately 30%&#160;of the available coastal habitat), and given the ongoing threats from fishing and habitat loss across much of its range and suspected reductions of over 50% of its population size within three generations, this species is assessed globally as Endangered.","The Zebra Shark occurs in tropical and subtropical, shallow inshore and offshore waters, often found on and around coral and rocky reefs and on sandy plateaus near coral, at depths down to at least 62 m. They are often observed resting on the bottom as well as swimming near the surface as both juveniles and adults.<br/><br/>The Zebra Shark demonstrates seasonal movement patterns in subtropical locations towards the latitudinal extent of their distribution (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2013). Regular seasonal movements of over 1,000 km and a larger movement of over 2,000 km along the Queensland coast in Australian waters have been recorded using acoustic tracking methods (C. Dudgeon, unpublished data). Aggregations along coastal sites in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales occur during the warmer months of each year (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2008, Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species demonstrates strong site fidelity to particular reefs in Australia (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2013) and Thailand (Spot the Leopard Shark Thailand, unpublished data), which may make them more susceptible to targeted fishing.<br/><br/>The Zebra Shark is an oviparous species. Size at birth ranges between 20 and 36 cm total length (TL). Reproductive periodicity in the wild is unknown. Captive aquaria animals have demonstrated annual egg laying periods of up to 3 months with 40–80 eggs laid per year (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2011) with up to 25% of eggs resulting in hatchlings (Squire Jnr, pers. comm., 22 Jul 2014). Age of maturity of captive female sharks is approximately 6-8 years of age based on the commencement of egg laying (Thomas, pers. comm., 18 Feb 2015; Robinson, pers. comm., 11 Jan 2015) and 7 years of age for males (Watson, pers. comm., 18 Feb 2015). Adults reach a maximum size of 246 cm TL with no sexual dimorphism evident (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2008) and live over 28 years in aquaria (Thomas, pers. comm., 17 Feb 2015). Generation length estimates based on 6 years first age at maturity and 28 years maximum longevity for female sharks is 17 years.","The Zebra Shark is susceptible to capture in a wide range of inshore fisheries and although there is no direct evidence of population decline in the Indo-West Pacific, market surveys suggest this species is much less common than it used to be (L.J.V Compagno and W.T. White, pers. comms., 2003, Pillans and Simpfendorfer 2003). Surveys from 2004-2012 in Thailand indicate that the Zebra Shark is regularly landed at fish markets on the Andaman Sea but was not recorded from the Gulf of Thailand (Krajandara 2014). However, photographs show Zebra Shark available for auction at the Samut-Sakorn fish market near Bangkok in Thailand in 2012 (Arthur Jones Dionio, pers. comm). The geographic origin of these animals is unknown as Thai fleets also operate in foreign waters (Chen 1996). The Zebra Shark is reported from fisheries operating out of Taiwan (Chen <em>et al. </em>1997), Myanmar (SEAFDEC 2004), Bangladesh (Hoq&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), India (Theisavigamani and Subbiah 2014), the Persian Gulf, the Oman Sea (Valinassab<em> et al. </em>2006, Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007), and Zanzibar (Shehe and Jiddawi 1997). Fish market surveys in Indonesia during April 2001-March 2006 recorded 77 Zebra Sharks with almost all coming from trawl fishery bycatch in Jakarta (Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Anecdotal reports suggest that a substantial decrease in Zebra Shark sightings in the Berau Archipelago, East Kalimantan was from fishers using a free diving harpooning catch method targeting Zebra Shark (Erdmann, pers. comm., 23 March 2015). Genetic analyses (DNA barcoding) of shark fins collected during market surveys conducted across Indonesia from mid 2012 to mid 2014 found the vast majority of landed species were pelagic sharks with common reef and carpet sharks (including Zebra Sharks) extremely rare. Given the extensive shallow coastal habitat around Indonesia that would support the reef and carpet shark species, the authors conclude that this is a strong indication of the collapse of reef shark populations in Indonesia, most likely due to overfishing (Semibiring <em>et al. </em>2015). Documented large declines in shark and ray catches associated with corresponding increases in fishing effort in the Java Sea (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009) are likely to have a large impact on the Zebra Shark in Indonesian waters and may be representative of fishing impacts across the region.<br/><br/>Legal and illegal fishing pressure has increased substantially in the Arafura Sea over the last 30 years (Resosudarmo<em> et al.</em> 2009). Trawling was banned in 1980 in all waters of the Indonesian 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone west of longitude 130 E. This resulted in concentrated trawling pressure in the eastern part of the Timor Sea and the Arafura Sea. Approximately 90%&#160;of the large industrial scale vessels are foreign-owned and aim to collect maximum possible biomass including elasmobranchs (Fegen 2003). Zebra Sharks are likely to comprise part of this catch given their presence as bycatch in trawl surveys from neighbouring regions (Okera and Gunn 1986, Ramm 1997, Roelofs and Stapley 2003). Thai vessels comprise the largest demersal trawl fleet (Fegen 2003) and the numbers of Thai vessels operating in the Arafura Sea have increased from reports of 150 vessels (Chen 1996) to approximately 700 vessels (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2005). Fegen (2003) reports that the Indonesian government issued 1,500 trawl licenses between 1998 and 2001. Thai vessels offload their catch onto freezer ships (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2005) which are then transported for sale in Thai fish markets including Samut-sakorn province, Samut-prakarn province and Songkla province (Chen 1996).<br/><br/>The Zebra Shark is found in inshore, shallow coastal areas including mudflat, mangrove and seagrass beds as juveniles and then move further offshore to coral and rocky reef areas as adults. Threats to these key habitats occur in Southeast Asia with substantial coastal development including prawn farming in coastal areas as well as up to 80% of corals bleaching in the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand during periods of elevated water temperatures in 2010 (Yeemin <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Threats within Australia are likely to be minimal. There are no target fisheries and small numbers are captured as bycatch in the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (Harry&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), the Northern Prawn Fishery (Zhou and Griffiths 2008), the Pilbara Trawl fishery (Western Australia Department of Fisheries 2010) and in nets deployed by the Queensland Shark Control program (Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). However, they demonstrate a high level of survival and records for these fisheries indicate a 79.5-100% post release survival rate. Recent acoustic tracking studies demonstrate that Zebra Sharks undertake large seasonal migrations on the eastern Australia coastline with regular movements of over 1,000 km annually and larger distances of over 2,000 km recorded in six months (C. Dudgeon unpublished data). Therefore it is possible for Zebra Sharks to move from Australia into nearby regions with fishing pressure such as the Indonesian Arafura Sea and Timor Seas.<br/><br/>A prawn trawl fishery consisting of about nine vessels operates in the Gulf of Papua in southern Papua New Guinea where Zebra Shark are caught in low numbers and mostly as juveniles (L. Baje, National Fisheries Authority, pers. comm., 2015).","The Zebra Shark comprises two distinct subpopulations based on the population genetic analysis of 13 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial ND4 sequences: Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian subpopulation and Eastern Indonesian-Oceania subpopulation (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian subpopulation</strong><br/>Population size information for the Indian Ocean-Southeast Asian subpopulation is limited. Zebra sharks are reported from fish markets across the region&#160;(Pillans and Simpfendorfer 2003). An ongoing photo-identification program in Thailand has identified approximately 250 individual Zebra Sharks in the Krabi Province in the Andaman Sea with most records from 2012–2015 (Spot the Leopard Shark Thailand, unpublished data). In contrast, only two sightings of Zebra Sharks have been reported from the Gulf of Thailand over this time. Vidthayanon (1997) and Compagno (2001) report the species as having declined in the Gulf of Thailand. Recent fish market surveys support substantial population declines in the Gulf of Thailand as the Zebra Shark was not sighted at landing sites in this region (Krajangdara 2014). Surveys of SCUBA dive schools operating in the Gulf of Thailand have recorded a significant reduction in sightings between the 1990s and 2000s from an average of one shark sighted per dive to &lt;0.25 sharks sighted per dive (Ward-Paige and Lotze 2011).<br/><br/>The Zebra Shark is likely to be locally extinct from several locations throughout Indonesia. In particular, extensive SCUBA surveys for fish diversity assessments at sites across the Indonesian Archipelago have recorded none (Bali, Anambas Archipelago, Timor-Leste, Triton Bay and Cenderasih Bay in West Papua) or very few Zebra Sharks (Southwest Sulawesi; North Sulawesi; Raja Ampat) (Erdmann, pers. comm., 23 March 2015).&#160;The Zebra Shark was observed regularly (3-7 animals per dive) on dive sites at Berau Archipelago off East Kalimantan during surveys in 1997 but none were observed on subsequent surveys in 2002 and 2004 (Erdmann, pers. comm., 23 March 2015).<br/><em><strong><br/></strong></em><strong>Eastern Indonesian-Oceania subpopulation</strong><br/>The Zebra Shark is found in large aggregations (20-50 animals) over sand near reef systems in parts of its Australian range (Pillans and Simpfendorfer 2003, Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2008). Abundance estimates based on mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification surveys of mature individuals are available for an unexploited aggregation in southern Queensland, Australia: 458 (95% CI = 298-618) (Dudgeon <em>et al</em>. 2008). Genetic effective population size estimates based on microsatellite data closely approximate these census sizes (377, 95% CI = 274–584) (Dudgeon and Ovenden 2015) suggesting the aggregation is composed of breeding adults. This population extends along the Queensland coast with genetic evidence of some segregation from northern Australia.<br/><br/>Population estimates for areas outside of Australia are unknown. Anecdotal reports from Conservation International staff at Raja Ampat in Eastern Indonesia suggest that the Zebra Shark used to be common on the large sandy regions around the reefs but are now rare.",Decreasing,The Zebra Shark is found in inshore waters of the continental and insular shelves of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans&#160;(Compagno 2001).,"Zebra Sharks are landed whole and used for their fins, skin (dried), meat and cartilage (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). Zebra Sharks are kept in aquaria around the world. They breed well in  aquaria and eggs and adults are also taken from the wild for aquaria  stock. They are valuable within the recreational SCUBA diving industry,  particularly in eastern Australia waters (C.

It is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 330–460 m, though its depth range is poorly known and it could occur deeper. It has very low biological productivity with only one pup produced per litter. The species is taken as bycatch, and possibly targeted, by demersal trawl and longline fisheries, and is likely retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and for fish meal. There are no species-specific population trends although landings data of all sharks combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) can be used to infer a reduction of 62% in the Longfin Gulper Shark over the past three generation lengths (83 years). The catch-per-unit effort of <em>Centrophorus</em> species in Lombok, Indonesia dramatically declined by 88% over two years from 2016–2018 with an inferred 99% decline in catches over three generation lengths (83 years).<em>  </em>It currently has refuge from fishing pressure in Papua New Guinea. <em>Centrophorus</em> species stocks have collapsed within 20 years where they have been targeted in Maldives and Australia which is evidence that <em>Centrophorus</em> species are unable to sustain intense target or bycatch fishing pressure due to their limited biological productivity. It is&#160;suspected that the Longfin Gulper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (83 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Longfin Gulper Shark is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 330–460 m (White <em>et al.</em> 2018). The depth range information is limited and only recorded from Papua New Guinea, and it possibly occurs deeper (White <em>et al.</em> 2017, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The species reaches a maximum size of 93 cm total length (TL), males mature at 68 cm TL and females mature by 87 cm TL (White and Dharmadi 2010, White <em>et al.</em> 2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of one pup (based on only two observed pregnant females) and size-at-birth of ~35 cm TL (White <em>et al.</em> 2018). Reproductive periodicity is unknown but could be 2–3 years based on other <em>Centrophorus </em>spp. (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, the Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus granulosus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 16.5 years and a maximum age of 39 years, resulting in a generation length of 27.8 years (Guallart 1998).","<p>The Longfin Gulper Shark  is taken as bycatch by deep-water trawl and likely deep-water longline, and retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and for fish meal.<a name=""_Hlk21689450""> The species is a bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off  the northeast and southwest coasts of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m;  these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the  incidental catch retained (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013; reported as <em>Centrophorus</em> cf. <em>lusitanicus </em>(Lowfin  Gulper Shark), D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The fishery on the east  coast, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper  waters over the past 30 years (from 1998 to 2019) due to depletion of  shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing depths  of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Prior  to 30 years ago (about one generation length) this species would not  have been fished in Taiwan as it was beyond the depth of the fishing  gear. During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling  and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho  pers. comm. 28/08/2019); this would provide a reprieve from fishing  pressure for the Longfin Gulper Shark. Deep-water longlines in Taiwan  operate at depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species as its upper depth  limit is beyond the reach of the longline gear. <br/><br/></a>In Taiwan, by the 1950s, coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is likely taken on deep-water demersal longlines that operate at depths of 150–600 m (White <em>et al.</em> 2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). The deep-water demersal longlines fishing effort has remained relatively constant over the past 15 years, except for West Java where the fishery ceased operating in ~2010 (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the species' upper-depth limit is beyond the reach of the trawl fisheries that operate to a maximum depth of 200 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). It may have previously been encountered in the Philippines by bottom set multiple hook-and-line gear that targeted dogfish sharks for their liver oil; the fishery was intensive from the 1960s–1980s and still operates but at an artisanal scale and not in the western Sulu Sea area (Gaudiano and Alava 2003, Flores 2004, D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020, J. Utzurrum unpubl. data 2020). In Papua New Guinea, the species is not encountered by commercial fishers (White <em>et al.</em> 2017), as it occurs at depths not yet fished (NFA 2020).</p>","<p>The Longfin Gulper Shark is caught relatively frequently but in low numbers in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013; reported as <em>Centrophorus </em>cf. <em>lusitanicus</em> (Lowfin Gulper Shark), D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Elsewhere, it has only been reported from landing sites with no information on catch rates (White <em>et al.</em> 2017). There is no species-specific data from Taiwan, landings data are available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. The landings data showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from 1953 to 2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t annually in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. This represents a 62% decline when scaled to the past three generation lengths (83 years) for the Longfin Gulper Shark, and although not species-specific, is informative for inferring the possible levels of reduction of this species in Taiwan.<br/><br/>In Lombok, Indonesia the catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. declined markedly by 88% from 2016 to 2018 and then remained at the 2018 level in 2019 (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, data from a targeted demersal longline fishery for gulper sharks&#160;landed in Tenau, East Nusa Tenggara documented a decline in catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) from 145 kg/trip to 78 kg/trip between 2011–2014 (Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017).&#160;Total catch of dogfishes, a mixed category for more than 10 species, reported to the Indonesian&#160;National Shark Data Collection program&#160;decreased from&#160;16,536 t in 2005 to 4,820 t in 2016&#160;(DGCF 2017). This equates to&#160;&gt;99% reduction in population over three generation lengths (83 years) of the Longfin Gulper Shark. <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. populations are reported to have collapsed  when fished intensively for as little as two decades, as seen in the  Maldives and Australia (Graham <em>et al.</em> 2001, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). These collapses indicate that the biologically unproductive <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. are unable to sustain intense target or bycatch fishing pressure.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across the range of this species, inferred population declines in Taiwan are 62% across the past three generation lengths of the Longfin Gulper Shark (83 years), with an 88% recent decline in CPUE for all <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. in Lombok, Indonesia over two years, and 99% inferred decline in catches of the Longfin Gulper Shark over three generation lengths (83 years). This species likely has little resilience to fishing pressure. It has refuge in some parts of its range as it occurs beyond the depth of fishing gear. Overall, based on actual levels of exploitation, it is suspected that the Longfin Gulper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (83 years).<br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-AU""> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Longfin Gulper Shark is patchily distributed across the Northwest and Western Central Pacific, and the Eastern Indian Oceans. It is known from Taiwan, eastern Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea (Huon Gulf) and likely, but not morphologically verified, from off Puerto Princesa City, eastern Philippines (White<em> et al.</em> 2017). The specimen from Philippines was slightly different genetically from other <em>Centrophorus longipinni</em>s but similar to an Indonesian specimen that was examined and found to be morphologically identical to the other <em>C. longipinnis</em> specimens (White<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>","<p>In Indonesia, <em>Centrophorus</em> spp. are landed with the livers removed and used for meat; the liver oil is processed locally and exported (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Elsewhere, based on other <em>Centrophorus</em> spp., the Longfin Gulper Shark is likely used for its meat, fins (low value), and liver oil (high value) (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). Individuals too small for human consumption are likely used for fish meal (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). </p>",Marine,"<p>There are no species-specific conservation measures in place. In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019). Since 2005, shark fins must be naturally attached on vessels that use ice to preserve the catch (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao<em> et al.</em> 2019). Research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catches should be monitored. To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It occurs on continental and insular slopes at depths of 340–610 m. The species may be retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years). All of the species' distribution overlaps with intense fishing activities.

It reaches a maximum size of at least 99 cm total length (TL); males mature ~71 cm TL; females mature ~86 cm TL; size-at-birth ~40 cm TL (White <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nothing else is known of its biology Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely related species, Harrison's Dogfish (<em>Centrophorus harrissoni</em>), which has a female age-at-maturity of 23 years and a maximum age of 36 years, resulting in a generation length of 29.5 years (Whitely 2004).","<p></p><p>Off East Africa, fishing effort is intense (Jacquet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Benkenstein 2013) and monitoring of artisanal and industrial fishing is difficult and reporting of catch landings is poor. Fishing effort is expanding into deeper waters and in some areas, shore-based artisanal fisheries using a number of gear types have the capacity to fish at depths where the species is likely to occur. Unidentified deep-water sharks, including <em>Centrophorus</em> spp, have been landed recently in Zanzibar Island, Tanzania (R. Bennett pers. comm. 21/02/20). All catch in these artisanal fisheries is likely to be utilized (R. Bennett pers. comm. 21/02/2020). There are a number of industrial demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to 1968, which operate in the Southeast Indian Ocean and target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Bycatch comprises a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Fishing pressure in this region is expected to continue. For example, in 2017, the fishery in Madagascar intensified from 2 to 12 Chinese deep-water trawlers in 2017 without any known management measures (R. Bennett pers. comm. 25/5/2018). <br/><br/>Across West Africa, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950–2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1950–1998,&#160;there was an apparent increase in reported landings&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Gulper sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). Recently, targeted longline fisheries for <em>Centrophorus </em>spp and other deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016).&#160;In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;</p><p></p><br/><p></p>","Population size and trends for this species are unknown. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp) are highly susceptible to population reduction from fishing activities because of their slow life histories. Targeted gulper shark fisheries have experienced significant reductions (&gt;95%) in the catch or have altogether collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years) (Graham <em>et al. </em>2001, Ali 2015). <br/><br/>Across West Africa, fishing pressure is intense, and many fisheries are now characterised by severe overexploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel <em>et al.</em> 2007).&#160;Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks, including gulper sharks,&#160;in the Mauritania Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and<em> Merluccius polli</em>) fishery declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). This would amount to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations&#160;(89 years).&#160;Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and the likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Given its presently known distribution, the species may be widely distributed around most of Africa and may find some refuge where there are little or no deep-water fishing activities.

It is an inshore and offshore pelagic species that occurs in continental shelf areas from the surface to depths of 50 m. The species has a low reproductive output with one pup born, possibly every 1–3 years, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity and be incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devilray (<em>Mobula</em>&#160;spp.) fisheries worldwide.&#160;The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray was a large component of targeted fisheries in Pakistan, and possibly Indonesia, but has not been reported in recent years. This species is also a bycatch component of many small and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated and reported as&#160;<em>Mobula</em>&#160;spp. Species misidentification of the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray in catches and landings is exacerbated by its confusion with the Shortfin Devilray (<em>M. kuhlii</em>), that has only recently been clarified with the designation of the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray as a separate and valid species. The lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that populations are declining worldwide. Notable declines in landings of the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray of 100% over five years have been documented at one fishing landing site in Pakistan. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the past three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. Based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020–2058) due to ongoing demand for high-value products, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd+3d.<em></em>","<em></em>The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray is an inshore and offshore species found in continental shelf areas, including coral reef habitats, to 50 m deep (Weigmann 2016, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020). Schooling behaviour is common for this species (Broadhurst <em>et al.</em> 2018, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2020). It reaches a maximum size of 130 cm disc width (DW); males and females are mature by 99 cm DW and 92.5 cm DW, respectively (Broadhurst <em>et al.</em> 2018, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2020). Reproduction is viviparous, with a gestation period at least 10 months and possibly &gt;12 months, generally producing a single large pup with an estimated size-at-birth of ~43 cm DW (Broadhurst <em>et al.</em> 2018, Broadhurst <em>et al. </em>2019). Other <em>Mobula</em> species have a resting period of 1–3 years between pregnancies (Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em> 2018), and this may also be true case for the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray. Age-at-maturity and maximum age are unknown; they are inferred from the only <em>Mobula</em> spp. with age parameters, the congener Giant Devilray (<em>M. mobular</em>), that has an estimated age-at-maturity of 5–6 years and maximum age of 20 years (Cuevas-Zimbrón<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013, Pardo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), resulting in a generation length of 12.8 years. However, the Giant Devilray reaches a considerably larger size than the Bentfin Devilray (520 vs 130 cm DW) and therefore this generation length is likely overestimated.","<p>Mobulid rays, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, are targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and artisanal fisheries (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020). These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their tendency to aggregate makes mobulid rays particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine fisheries and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017). Devilrays are often easy to target because of their large size, slow swimming speed, tendency to aggregate or predictably use specific habitats, and their general lack of human avoidance (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012). The species’ preference for coastal waters places it within the range of inshore fisheries, which are known to be intensive in many parts of its range, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and elsewhere (de Young 2006,&#160;Flewelling&#160;and&#160;Hosch&#160;2006, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>Some of the largest documented targeted artisanal fisheries for  mobulids, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, have been in India,  Indonesia, Mozambique, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan  (Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).  In some regions, directed artisanal fisheries can land hundreds of  Longhorned Pygmy Devilray per annum (that may include the Shortfin Devilray, <em>M. kuhlii</em>) (Alava&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Dewar 2002, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison<em>&#160;et al</em>.  2018). While many artisanal fisheries have grown into trade fisheries,  some still target these rays mainly for food and local products (White<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006a,  Fernando and Stevens 2011). Mobulids, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray,  are caught incidentally as bycatch throughout their ranges in small- and  large-scale fisheries (Croll&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Despite being  unintentionally caught, mobulid rays are typically kept because of their  high trade value and even when discarded alive they are often injured  and have high post-release mortality (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016,  Francis and Jones 2017). <br/></p>    <p>Even after Appendix listings on the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and dozens of national fishing bans, many fisheries remain open and active. Robust, quantitative assessments are challenging because multiple mobulid species are caught and landed simultaneously, and species identification continues to be a source of error in this group (Croll&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;</p>  <p>Global landings of mobulid species, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, have been increasing steadily due in large part to the recent rise (from the 1990s onwards) in demand for gill plates (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Many former bycatch fisheries have become directed commercial export fisheries (Dewar 2002, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006b, Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Between 2000 and 2007, total reported landings of ‘Mantas, devil rays nei’ ('nei' refers to 'not elsewhere included') increased from 900 tonnes to over 3,300 tonnes and from 2008 to 2014 landings averaged 4,462 t per annum, according to the FAO Fishstat Capture Production database (Lack and Sant 2009, Oakes and Sant 2019); reported landings are likely to represent only a fraction of total fishing-related mortality (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Almost all (99%) of mobulid gill plates are destined for the markets of Guangzhou, China, with these products sourced from over 20 countries and regions (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al. </em>2017). The source locations for the largest product volumes are Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, China, and Viet Nam (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Demand has driven up the price of these products in recent decades as well as the volume of product being traded. Between 2011 and 2013, there was an increase from 60 to 120 t of mobulid gill plates moved through shops in Guangzhou (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In the Indian Ocean, specifically India, intensive gillnet fisheries take mobulid species, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, along the eastern and western coasts of India (Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, Nair <em>et al.</em> 2015). Devilrays are also taken in the Indian Ocean as bycatch in pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries targeting swordfish (Coelho<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011), and in the tuna purse seine fishery (Lezama-Ochoa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) but effort trends for these fisheries are unknown. Off Pakistan, Longhorned Pygmy Devilray was the second most commonly landed mobulid from 2013 to 2015 and represented 30% of the mobulids landed by number as bycatch from tuna gillnet fisheries in Karachi Fish Harbour (Khan 2018). In the Saudi Red Sea, only one specimen of the Shortfin Devilray (<em>M. kuhlii</em>) which may have been the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, was recorded during extensive landing site surveys in 2011–2013 (Spaet and Berumen 2015). The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray is rarely reported in landings from the Arabian Gulf (Stevens <em>et al. </em>2018). In Oman and United Arab Emirates, devilrays, likely including Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, are often caught incidentally using beach seines (FAO 2019, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data).</p>  <p>In Indonesian waters, the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray is frequently reported in fishery landings (Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018) and was possibly misidentified as <em>Mobula </em>cf. <em>kuhlii </em>that accounted for 2% of the abundance of mobulids landed as bycatch of gillnet fisheries targeting Skipjack Tuna (<em>Katsuwonus pelamis</em>) (White <em>et al.</em> 2006b).&#160; <em>Mobula eregoodootenkee</em> (previous nomenclature for the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray) was not reported from 2014 surveys of three Indonesian sites where targeted mobulids are landed, although it may have been misidentified as <em>Mobula</em> cf. <em>kuhlii</em> or included as <em>Mobula</em> spp. (Lewis<em> et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>In the Western and Central Pacific from 2010 to 2015, observed bycatch of mobulids (excluding Giant Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>)) in purse seine fisheries was 4,324 individuals, and in longline fisheries was 410 individuals. The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray is likely among these catches, and although none were reported, the majority of catches were reported as <em>Mobula</em> spp., hence many were not identified to species (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016).&#160;</p>  <p>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, climate change, ocean acidification, oil spills, and other pollution, including microplastics and contaminants (e.g. persistent organic pollutants) (Essumang 2010, Ooi <em>et al. </em>2015, Stewart&#160;<em>et al. </em>2018, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;Furthermore, shallow water lagoon systems have been identified as important nursery habitats of other mobulids. The effects of habitat destruction and degradation and pollution in these systems may negatively impact the survival of juvenile Longhorned Pygmy Devilrays (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>","<p>Some localized data for the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray are available. Globally, genus-wide declines are suspected based on a combination of declining sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) data from monitored populations, catch landings data, and evidence of depletions (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Couturier<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012, Hall and Roman 2013, Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013,&#160;Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015, Croll <em>et al. </em>2016, Rohner <em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2017). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Many of the rates of decline are inferred or suspected, based on generic declines or inferences combined with knowledge of the area of occurrence for specific species, general abundance estimates, and constraining biological traits. <br/></p>  <p>In Pakistan waters, the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray was the second most common species of <em>Mobula</em>&#160;landed in 2013, yet landings of this species declined severely from 2013 to 2018 (Khan 2018, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2020). The landings of 10–20 individuals per month at Karachi Fish Harbour peaked at 54 individuals in October 2013, then declined rapidly from 2014 to an absence of any individuals from 2017 onwards, despite regular fisheries monitoring (Khan 2018). This infers a drastic population reduction of the species in Pakistan over a short period of 5 years, as the fishing effort remained fairly stable over that period (Khan 2018).</p>  <p>In Indian waters, population reductions are inferred based on general declines in devilray catches. Despite increasing effort in several regions, including Kerala (Nair&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), along the Chennai and Tuticorin coasts (Kizhakudan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), and Mumbai (Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2009), declining catches indicate depletion of stocks. Trawlers in Mumbai reported maximum landings of 6.3 t for '<em>M. diabolus</em>'&#160;(an invalid, perhaps generalized name for devilrays) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years when fishing effort almost doubled, from which local population declines can be inferred. </p>  <p>In Indonesian waters, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula</em> spp.' that may include the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor; and, Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al. </em>2015). From 2001 to 2014, landings of Shortfin Devilray (<em>M. kuhlii</em>), that may be misidentified Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, declined by 93% in Tanjung Luar, and was not reported during 2014 in Cilacap (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from these landed catch declines and a concurrent increase in the number of operating fishing vessels. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids, including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fisheries either collapsing or fishers having to switch to new fishing grounds, often significantly further distances away from ports (Dewar 2002, Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;</p>  <p>Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devilrays in several regions, specifically at major known aggregation areas for the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, with suspected local and regional declines of 50–99% over the last three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray global population has undergone a reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020–2058) due to ongoing demand for products. </p>",Decreasing,"<em></em>The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray has an Indo-West Pacific distribution from South Africa to Australia (Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). As presently known, the distribution is patchy, but it is most likely more wide-ranging than current confirmed records suggest.","<p>The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray is used for its meat, and likely as for other <em>Mobula</em> species, the skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates (Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2020). The meat from mobulid rays, including the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, is often used locally or traded regionally, both fresh and dried, for human consumption (Khan 2018, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Similar to other <em>Mobula</em> species, it is likely that the cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs <em>et al.</em> 2011, Couturier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). The gill plates are used for Chinese health tonics (O’Malley <em>et al. </em>2017). However, to date there are no confirmed records from retail surveys of gill plates in trade of the Longhorned Pygmy Devilray, or of the similar-sized Shortfin Devilray (<em>M. kuhlii</em>) (Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray gill plates are unique and easy to identify and it is possible that their small size precludes demand, as smaller gill plates fetch lower prices, or that they have been included as <em>Mobula</em> spp. in the retail surveys (O’Malley <em>et al.</em> 2017, Notobartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020). </p>",Marine,"<p><a name=""_Hlk2848366"">The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for elasmobranchs, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. </a></p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk2848373"">The Longhorned Pygmy Devilray was listed on Appendix I and II of CMS in 2014, reflecting Parties’ commitments to strictly protect the species and work regionally toward conservation, respectively.

This latest measure still allows retention and donation for domestic human consumption of any <em>Mobula </em>species unintentionally captured and landed by purse seine vessels.

It is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper-mid slope at estimated depths of 180–790 m. The species is a bycatch of deep-water demersal trawl and longline fisheries and retained for human consumption and fish meal. Landings data from northeast Taiwan and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays across the Taiwan and Japan Exclusive Economic Zones indicate declines of 52–99% over the past three generation lengths (63 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Fishing pressure is high across the spatial and depth range of the Taiwan Spurdog. Fishing pressure and demersal trawl effort in Japan is decreasing and continuing to decline. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan may also afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. It is inferred that the Taiwan Spurdog has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (63 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","<p>The Taiwan Spurdog is demersal on the outer continental shelf and upper-mid slope (White and Iglésias 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). The depth range is unknown, but based on records from Taiwan is estimated at 180–790 m (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a maximum size of 85 cm total length (TL); males mature at 73 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2007, White and Iglésias 2011, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a closely-related species, the Japanese Spurdog (<em>Squalus japonicus</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 19.3 years and a maximum age of 22 years, resulting in a generation length of 21 years (Sioa 2010).</p>","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. In Taiwan, and likely Japan, it is taken as bycatch by deep-water demersal trawl and longline and retained (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, deep-water trawl fisheries operate on the east coast, targeting multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained and marketed (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The fishery, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper water over the past 30 years (from 1998 to 2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species; from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Commercial deep-water longlines operate on the east coast of Taiwan, targeting mostly tuna with incidental catch of shark retained and marketed. The longline fishery likely began during the 1980s, and operates at depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22884355"">In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). </a>The number of powered vessels operating in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao<em> et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk21698750"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). </a><a name=""_Hlk22647605"">The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). </a><a name=""_Hlk21701990""></a><a name=""_Hlk21701973""></a>Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg per capita in 2013 it is higher than that of neighbouring China (Helgil 2019).</p>","<p>Fifteen years ago this species was the most common <em>Squalus</em> spp. landed in Taiwan (White and Iglésias 2011) but it is not commonly landed now (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). In the Yilan County, northeast Taiwan, the combined catch of all small shark species taken by bottom trawl decreased by 81% over 10 years from 1999 to 2008 (Siao 2010). That is, from ~2,600 t in 1999 to ~500 t in 2008. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Although there is no detailed concurrent effort data, the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area remained fairly stable from 1999 to 2008 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). This infers that there was a marked population decline of small sharks caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1999 to 2008.<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">Landings data are also available on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Liao<em> et al</em>. 2019, </a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019</a><a name=""_Hlk20403143"">). </a>Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, despite attempts by the Taiwan government to restrict effort in response to depletion of fisheries resources. Since the 1990s, industrial effort has declined, however there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. <br/><br/>The landings data in Taiwan showed a 52% decline of all combined shark species over 63 years from the 1953–2015. The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). These long-term declines in shark abundance can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.<br/><br/>There is no species-specific landing data from Japan, although catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the <a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Japan EEZ</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Across Japan, fishing effort has declined by about one third since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). The reconstructed catch data showed a 98% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ over 65 years, that is from around 1,300 t annually in the early 1950s to around 14 t annually from 2010 to 2014. Some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ.<br/><br/>When the declines in Yilan County, the entire Taiwan EEZ, and the entire Japan EEZ are scaled to three generation lengths (63 years) they represent declines of 99%, 52%, and 97% respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.<br/><br/>Fishing pressure is high across the spatial and depth range of the Taiwan Spurdog. Fishing pressure and bottom trawl effort in Japan is decreasing and continuing to decline. Most of the distribution is in Taiwan waters where the inferred declines over three generations (63 years) range from 52–99%. The inshore trawl bans in Taiwan may also afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Overall, it is inferred that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (63 years).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Taiwan Spurdog is endemic to Taiwan and southern Japan in the Northwest Pacific (White and Iglésias 2011, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","<p>In Taiwan, and possibly Japan, the larger individuals are used for human consumption and the smaller individuals are used for fish meal (H.

There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21700268"">In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is found inshore on the continental shelf in depths of less than 50 m, associated with turbid estuarine waters. The species is caught in a variety of gears including demersal trawls and gillnets and the meat is retained for human consumption and the fins are traded. This species was recently resurrected and hence there is little information on former and current catches. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Reconstructed catches of mainly carcharhinids and elasmobranchs in Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia (Peninsular and Sarawak), and China can be used to infer population reductions of 28–76% when these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Borneo Broadfin Shark (20 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in carcharhinid sharks, particularly in the central part of this species distribution. The species is exposed to intense fishing pressure and has no refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Borneo Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (20 years) due to actual or potential fishing levels, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Borneo Broadfin Shark occurs inshore on the continental shelf associated with turbid estuarine waters and presumably in depths of less than 50 m based on its sister species, the Broadfin Shark (<em>Lamiopsis temminckii</em>) (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It attains a maximum size of 157 cm total length (TL), males mature at ~114 cm TL and females mature at 130 cm TL (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, White et al. 2010, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of typically of 4–8 pups (usually 8), a gestation length of eight months and a size-at-birth of 40–60 cm TL (Last et al. 2010). The generation length is suspected to be around 6.5 years, similar to that of the Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) which is a similar-sized species from the same family (Lessa <em>et al</em>. 2000).","There is little information on catches of the Borneo Broadfin Shark as species-specific data are not usually recorded. The species is taken in a variety of gear including demersal trawls and inshore gillnets at locations influenced by river run-off, such as Mukah, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g., Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks are subject to intense fishing pressure on coastal and shelf habitats in Viet Nam. There is some targeting of sharks using longlines, hook and line, and ‘shark lines’. Target shark fisheries developed in the 1980s in response to demand for shark fin and other products including shark skin, cartilage, and liver oil and reached a peak at the end of the 1980s followed by a decline in catches (Lack and Sant 2012, V. Vo pers. comm. 14 May 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the early 1970s but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The fleet tends to operate in offshore fisheries (&gt;5 nautical miles (nm) from shore) and mostly use trawls, but also purse seine, longlines, and traps (FAO 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nm from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated in the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak had more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009). As this species predominantly occurs inshore, pollution from river outflow is also a possible threat.","There are no species-specific time series available. Intensive fisheries began more than a century ago in the South China Sea region (Butcher 1996), which is one of the most heavily fished and poorly monitored regions in the world (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016, Hilborn <em>et al</em>. 2020). Consequently, most target fisheries of productive medium-sized teleost fishes were overfished by the 1960s and populations of larger sharks and rays collapsed and disappeared long before systematic catch documentation. For example, industrial trawl fisheries were introduced to the Gulf of Thailand in the 1960s and thereafter a rapid build-up of effort occurred due to initially large catches followed by the 1973 fuel crisis which forced vessels to return to their local waters in the Gulf of Thailand (Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). This led to a rapid decline in catch-per-unit-effort from 300 kg per hour of trawling in 1961 to 50 kg per hour in the 1980s and 20–30 kg per hour by the 1990s. By 1970, large finfish, sharks, and skates had been fished down resulting in a 60% decline with the first 5 years of industrialized trawl fishing in the Gulf of Thailand (Myers and Worm 2003, Pauly and Cheunpagadee 2003). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Landings data for 1998–2018 are available for all combined shark species from the Gulf of Thailand (Krajangdara 2019). These showed an 86% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 9,005 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to 1,250 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort, but it suggests that the population reduction from 1960 to 1990 of the overall 76% decline is likely to have continued and be much greater than this estimate. <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 were reconstructed for the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Throughout Indonesia, reconstructed carcharhinid catches increased throughout the mid- to late-1900s. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before collapsing by ~325% in the mid-1990s to 11,500 t, where catch has remained relatively stable since (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000–17,500 t until 2004. Thereafter, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600–14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian EEZ portion of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort.<br/><br/>Fishermen have reported decreased catches and smaller sizes of sharks in Indonesia, which is strongly indicative of overfishing. Decreases were reported in more recent years of commonly caught species, that is, Whitetip Reef Shark (<em>Trianaedon obesus</em>), Snaggletooth Shark (<em>Hemipristis</em> <em>elongata</em>), Silvertip Shark (<em>C. albimarginatus</em>), Blacktip Reef Shark (<em>C. melanopterus</em>), Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Grey Reef shark (<em>C. amblyrhynchos</em>), and Bull shark (<em>C. leucas</em>) and decreases starting 20 years ago in other species (Hammerhead sharks (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.), Wedgefishes (<em>Rhyncobatus </em>spp.), and Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>) with no species having increased in abundance over the past two decades (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are few records of the Borneo Broadfin Shark giving rise to concern that this species may be as depleted as Indonesian Guitarfish (<em>Rhinobatos penggali</em>) (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). <br/><br/>In Peninsular Malaysia, catch of carcharhinids in the east has increased at a relatively stable rate beginning in the 1950s to 2014 with a catch of ~4,500 t. In the west, Carcharhinid catch sharply increased in the early 1960s from under 1,000 t per year to ~6,500 t by the late 1970s. Catch has since decreased sharply and has been under 2,000 t per year since 2010 (Zeller and Pauly 2016), suggesting a decline of 66% over 40 years. This equates to a population reduction of 35% over three generation lengths (20 years) of the Borneo Broadfin Shark. In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), reconstructed carcharhinid landings showed a 66% decline from a peak of 7,400 t in 1997 to 2,500 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s, then sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t then decreased to 4–5,000 t throughout the 1980s, before increasing to the peak 1997 catch and then steeply declining in the mid-2000s. Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines can be used to infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Sarawak. A total of 42 records f the Borneo Broadfin Shark were found in Sarawak market surveys from 2017 to 2019, which represented 0.9% of recorded elasmobranchs on sale (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>When these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Borneo Broadfin Shark (20 years) they represent a population reduction of 76%, 28%, 72% and 29% in Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia (Peninsular and Sarawak), and China, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in carcharhinid sharks, particularly in the central part of this species distribution. Fishing pressure is intense across the species range, and it has no refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Borneo Broadfin Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (20 years) due to actual or potential fishing levels.",Decreasing,"The Borneo Broadfin Shark is found in the Western Central and Northwest Pacific in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, but likely occurs more widely through the Indo-Malay Archipelago to southern China (White <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013, Krajangdara 2019).","The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets across the region. The fins are dried and traded internationally (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cardeñosa <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,"No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). There are no marine protected areas (MPAs) in its Indonesian distribution (CTI 2020). <br/><br/>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12°N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, there are approximately 124 coastal marine protected areas in the southern China provinces, although only a few are documented internationally (McCook 2019). Fifty-four national marine reserves are reported by FAO (2019) and five marine protected areas, all each less than 20 km², are reported in the World Database of Protected Areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN 2019). All protected areas across China have recently been nationalized (McCook 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

Based on a generation length range of 12–20 years, the ratio of B/B<sub>MSY</sub> has declined between 78% and 90% over the past three generation lengths, or 36 to 60 years (1956–2016; 1965–2016; 1980–2016). However, this species is currently not subject to overfishing, and F/F<sub>MSY</sub> has averaged less than 1 over the past one generation length (12–20 years), indicating more sustainable current management. Southern Bluefin Tuna is therefore listed as Endangered under criterion A1.","Adult Southern Bluefin Tuna lead an oceanic, pelagic existence and can be found to depths of at least 1,000 m (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Like other tunas, the Southern Bluefin Tuna is an opportunistic feeder, preying on a wide variety of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps, and other marine animals (Serventy 1956).<br/><br/>Large Southern Bluefin Tuna migrate northwards to spawn in a relatively small area off northwestern Australia and to the south of Indonesia in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (Nishikawa <em>et al</em>. 1985). Sexually mature fish have been taken on the spawning grounds every month except July, with peaks in abundance during October and February (Farley and Davis 1998) at water surface temperatures in excess of 24 °C. Once females start spawning, they appear to spawn daily, similar to other tunas. On the spawning grounds, smaller fish (150–169 cm) are better represented in deep catches, while larger fish (190–209 cm) and spawning fish are better represented in shallow catches (Davis and Farley 2001). The Southern Bluefin is an asynchronous indeterminate spawner with an annual batch fecundity of 57 oocytes per gram of body weight, similar to that found for Yellowfin Tuna. Fecundity of a 158 cm female, with each ovary weighing about 1.7 kg, was estimated at about 14–15 million eggs (Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001). It is not known whether all mature fish spawn each year, every few years, or at a lower frequency.<br/><br/>Southern Bluefin larvae have only been caught within latitudes 7–20°S and longitudes 102–124°E from September to March (Ueyanagi 1969, Davis <em>et al</em>. 1990). After the larval stage, juveniles leave the spawning ground, moving south along the coast of Western Australia, reaching the south coast by age one where they spend the austral summer (Hobday <em>et al</em>. 2016). Most juveniles continue to spend austral summers in the Great Australian Bight until about age five. While in the Bight, telemetry indicates that fish spend much of the day in the upper 10 m and tend to move into deeper waters at night (Davis and Stanley 2002). During the winters they migrate across the Great Australian Bight and around Tasmania to 45°S, along the southeastern Australian coastline to about 30oS off northern New South Wales or as far east as New Zealand. Fish older than five years disperse widely across the southern oceans, from the Tasman Sea across the Indian Ocean to the Western Atlantic. Occurrence of juveniles 2–4 years of age on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean during the Austral summer months confirms that not all juveniles are restricted to the southern coastal waters of Australia (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, a large archival tagging study (Basson <em>et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the number of juveniles straying from Australian waters was quite small (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>The maximum size of the Southern Bluefin Tuna is 225 cm FL and 200 kg. The IGFA all-tackle game fish record is a 167.5 kg individual caught off Tathra, in southern New South Wales, Australia in July 2009 (IGFA, 2020). Use of the bomb radiocarbon dating suggest that a large percentage of&#160; fish greater than 180 cm FL are at least 20 years of age and that Southern Bluefin can live to ages in excess of 30 years (Kalish et al. 1996). Otolith-based aging found ages of upt to 41 years (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shimose and Farley 2016). Females outnumber males in catches of juveniles, but the sex ratio is reversed in adults, with males outnumbering females. The onset of maturity in females varies between 5 and 8 years, and length at first maturity between 110–130 cm FL (Thorogood 1986). Size at 50% maturity has been estimated to be 152 cm FL (Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001), and the mean age of maturity is 10–11 years, which does not differ significantly between the sexes (Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lin and Tzeng 2010, Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, generation length was very conservatively estimated to be at least 12 years due to estimated ages of first maturity and longevity of 10 and 40 years respectively (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010). However, most estimates of spawning seem to fall between 10-15 years for 50% spawning, which indicates that 12 years is likely too low of an estimate of generation length. Even if 100% spawning by age 9 is assumed (knife edge), the generation length is likely to be at least 20 years given an estimated longevity of at least 40 years (CCSBT 2013, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2014, A. Boustany pers. comm. July 2020). Therefore, generation length is estimated to be between 12 and 20 years, although 20 years may still be an underestimate.<br/><p></p>","<p></p>While Southern Bluefin Tuna is currently not undergoing overfishing, it is overfished and its biomass is extremely low compared to the historical levels (SSB is currently ~13% of unfished stock levels in southern Australia). Canning has been the most important form of local utilization of this highly esteemed fish until the early 1980s. Currently, Japan is the primary market, with a very high percentage of the world catches consumed as sashimi (Polacheck 2012, Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>Although the species is not currently overfished, at least in Australian waters, the main potential threat of overfishing still remains. One of the potential problems with the management of this species via annual total allowable catches (i.e. by weight of fish caught), however, is that most of the fish caught in southern Australian waters for sea cage fattening are immature juveniles, with at least 85% of the catch used for aquaculture (DAWE 2020). <br/><p></p>","The Southern Bluefin Tuna has been intensively fished since the 1950s, primarily being taken on longlines, although as of 2019, purse seines now account for approximately 32% of the catch. In 1992, the first commercial sea-cage farms began fattening purse seine-caught Southern Bluefin Tuna in large mesh enclosures moored offshore near Port Lincoln, South Australia (Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most of the tuna transferred to tuna farms are immature fish (age 2–4 years) and are fattened in enclosures for about 150 days. Worldwide reported landings show a gradual, but variable, increase from 13,716 mt in 1952 to a high of 81,416 mt in 1969, and then gradually decreasing to 10,961 tons in 1991. Catches from 1992 to 2012 were relatively stable, averaging around 16,000 mt per year, and steadily increased to 23,312 mt in 2016. Genetic and otolith composition analyses of Southern Bluefin from South Africa, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania showed no significant heterogeneity, consistent with the hypothesis of a single panmictic stock and spawning unit (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 1995, Grewe <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the 2017 stock assessment (CCSBT 2017), the species is estimated to have declined by 77%, 83% and 90% over three generation length periods of 36, 51 and 60 years respectively. Declines were calculated using a 3-year average for the endpoints and assuming a linear decline. The highest decline estimate is likely most representative of the overall status of this species, given that a generation length of 20 years may still be an underestimate.<br/><br/>According to the most recent 2020 reports, (ISSF 2020, CCSBT 2020), Southern Bluefin is heavily overfished but overfishing is not occurring due to measures taken in a rebuilding plan. Since 2017,&#160; the CCSBT has measured reproductive capacity as Total Reproductive Output (TRO) rather than Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). The most recent 2020 stock assessment (CCSBT 2020) suggested that the TRO is at 20% of its initial level, and remains below the target and the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield. This indicates improvements in the stock condition since the 2011 stock assessment, which indicated the stock in 2011 was at 5.5% of initial TRO, and the 2017 stock assessment, which indicated the stock in 2017 was at 13% of initial TRO.<br/><p></p>",Increasing,"The Southern Bluefin Tuna is found in the southern parts of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It primarily occurs in temperate and cold seas, mainly between 30°S and 50°S, to nearly 60°S, but moves up into tropical waters of the Eastern Indian Ocean to spawn (Collette and Graves 2019).","Southern Bluefin Tuna is an important commercial species. The main market is Japan, where a high percentage of the world's catches are consumed as sashimi (Polacheck 2012, Collette and Graves 2019). Juveniles (~2–5 years old) are caught by purse seine and fattened in sea cages off southern Australia, where currently ~85% of the Australian catch is used for that purpose.",Marine,"<p></p>Southern Bluefin Tuna is a highly migratory species listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. The stock is assessed and managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), but practically all catches are made in the IOTC, ICCAT and WCPFC convention areas (approximately 56% in the Indian Ocean, 27% in the Pacific Ocean and 17% in the Atlantic Ocean in 2019). It is important to note that under current management, the spawning population of Southern Bluefin Tuna has continued to recover since around 2009, and the population trajectory has been tracking toward the management target (CCSBT 2020).<br/><br/>The latest Management Procedure includes an interim target reference point of 30% Total Reproductive Output to be achieved with 50% probability by 2035 (DAWE 2020). The stock is primarily managed through annual total allowable catch (TAC). The TAC for 2021 to 2023 is 17,647 tonnes (ISSF, 2020). Other conservation measures adopted by the CCSBT include requirements for fleets to monitor and submit data to show compliance with TACs, development of scientific observer programs, monitoring of farming operations and port inspection of catches. However, the monitoring of farming operations may be inadequate, and therefore the purse seine catch may be uncertain. <br/><br/>The CCSBT scientific committee has long recommended the use of stereoscopic cameras to accurately estimate the amount of caged fish in farming operations, but this recommendation has not yet been realized. The CCSBT has also implemented a Trade Information Scheme to collect more accurate and comprehensive data on Southern Bluefin Tuna fishing by monitoring trade and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing (ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 59.2% over three generation lengths (44 years). Therefore, the Grey Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of  50–79% over the last three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation  and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Grey Reef Shark is found in clear tropical waters from the surface to depths of around 280 m (Last and Stevens 2009) and is common around coral reefs, particularly near drop-offs and fringing coral reefs. Its distribution is patchy in continental shelf waters. It attains a maximum size of 255 cm total length (TL), males mature at 110–145 cm TL and females mature at 120–142 cm TL (Wetherbee&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997,&#160;Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 1–6 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 48–49 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Wetherbee&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1997).&#160;Smart<em> et al.</em> (2016) provide age data from Papua New Guinea where the females mature at 9 years, and Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006) showed they reach a maximum age of at least 20 years on the Great Barrier Reef. Based on these data, generation length is estimated to be 14.5 years.","<p>The Grey Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. There is little species specific information on catches. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. However, it is occasionally taken in industrial scale fisheries. For example, Grey Reef Shark made up 4.2% (by number) of the sharks caught by the Papua New Guinea Shark Longline Fishery, making it the second most commonly caught species (White <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries.&#160;In Indonesia it makes up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Grey Reef Shark makes up 6.3% (by number) of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al</em>. 2015). In many parts of east Africa, and south and southeast Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.&#160;</p><p>This is a common display species in public and private aquaria.

Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.</p><p>&#160;</p>","Genetic and telemetry studies support an isolation by distance model of population structure (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2015, Momigliano <em>et al</em>. 2017) that result in significant structuring in the population. A lack of sampling throughout its range means the number and boundaries of these populations cannot yet be determined. There are numerous accounts of population trends for individual locations throughout its range. Many of these accounts have demonstrated substantial declines in abundance. This includes Chagos Archipelago where Graham <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated that the reef shark population, including Grey Reef Sharks, had declined by 90% between 1976 and 2005 based on diver surveys. However, Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2018) reconstructed shark populations at this location and concluded that Grey Reef Sharks had in fact recovered at this location to be at 79% of their original abundance. In the Pacific Ocean, Nadon <em>et al</em>. (2012) used manta tow data from 15 locations and found that Grey Reef Shark populations far from human populations (Jarvis Reef, Phoenix Islands, Line Islands, Johnston Atoll, Wake Island, Northwest Hawaiian Islands and western and northern Mariana Islands) were close to their carrying capacity, while those close to human populations (Hawaii (main islands), American Samoa and southern Mariana Islands) were heavily depleted (&lt;3% of carrying capacity). On Australia's Great Barrier Reef there are varying reports of population decline and recovery. Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported that Grey Reef Sharks were suffering from ongoing collapse, with annual declines of between 7 and 17%. However, subsequent research has shown that populations have not declined as dramatically as first estimated (Heupel <em>et al.</em> 2009), and Espinoza <em>et al</em>. (2014) demonstrating that rezoning of the reef had led to increasing abundance in areas protected from fishing.&#160;<br/><br/>To account for differences in the trends of Grey Reef Sharks between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimated depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef-level depletion estimates were aggregated, weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area), to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Grey Reef Sharks was estimated as 59.2% (standard error 51.9–66.5%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (434 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded, based on the Global Finprint data that the Grey Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% in the last  three generation lengths (44 years).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Grey Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-West and Central Pacific Oceans, and also occur in some parts of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (Last and Stevens 2009).","<p>This is species is retained for its meat, fins, liver and skin.

Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures).

It is also known to occur around and within mangrove forests, which may be used as nursery grounds. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and demersal trawl. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality; and mangroves from deforestation and coastal development. While there is limited species-specific data available, it is likely to have undergone declines based on its large size and presumably low productivity, and intensive coastal fisheries through much of its range. Landings surveys, dive surveys, diver interviews, and anecdotal evidence indicate substantial declines over the past three generations lengths (50 years). Results from baited remote underwater video system surveys of coral reefs across its range (242 reefs in 36 nations) indicate that the species has declined to very low levels through much of its range in Asia and Africa, but remains common in Australia, and in some island nations of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is estimated that the Sharptooth Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark&#160;is demersal in shallow inshore and offshore waters at depths to at least 90 m and is often found on and around coral reefs and on sandy plateaus near coral (Stevens 1984, Compagno 1998, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It is also known to occur around and within the mangrove forests in certain areas, which may be used as nursery grounds (Bonfil 2003). It reaches a maximum size of 340 cm total length (TL), males and females mature at 220–240 cm TL (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 6-12 pups (average 9.3), a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 60 cm TL. The generation length is suspected to be around 16.5 years, similar to that of the Lemon Shark (<em>Negaprion brevirostris</em>) which reaches a similar&#160;maximum&#160;size (Brown and Gruber 1988).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is caught throughout much of its range in industrial and small-scale longline, gillnet, trawl, and handline fisheries that occur in coastal waters, including around coral reefs and mangrove habitats. It is retained for the meat and fins where possible. There is little data available on the capture of this species in fisheries of island nations in the Pacific Ocean where the species show little trend in population size. Throughout the coastal waters of Asia, it is caught in gillnets, longlines, trawls and handlines and landed. However, in recent years it has rarely been reported in surveys of landings sites. For example, Winter <em>et al</em>. (2020) reported a single individual in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9 month period in 2017–2018. Similar levels of paucity of catch are reported in Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018), Philippines (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017) and Sri Lanka (Dissanayake 2005). In the Arabian Seas region, there is little species-specific data on&#160;Sharptooth Lemon Shark catch but generally, carcharhinids there are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (e.g., De Silva 2006, Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in northern waters. For example, Harry <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that it made up 0.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is&#160; taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019). The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was identified as a minor component of the large and prevalent Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) in northern Australian waters during the early 2000s (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Marshall 2011). However, the IUU fishing has declined significantly since 2006 due to increased border surveillance, international agreements, and possibly increased fuel prices and reduction in target shark species (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Haward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The reliance of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on mangrove habitats, especially as pupping and nursery grounds makes them susceptible to declines in habitat quality. The extent of mangrove habitat has declined markedly, with 20-35% of areas lost during the last half of the 20th century (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010) as a result of coastal development for urbanisation, aquaculture and agriculture, timber harvesting sand resource extraction (Goldberg <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was observed in a global baited remote underwater video system (BRUV) survey of global coral reefs (FinPrint 2020). The survey deployed 11,211 video units on 242 reefs in 36 nations throughout the geographic range of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species was not observed in sufficient numbers to quantitatively estimate levels of population reduction, however, it was regularly observed in Australia, and some island nations in the Western Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Palau) and Indian (e.g., Seychelles) Oceans (C.A. Simpfendorfer unpubl. data 2020). In these areas, its population appears to have remained stable. However, along the continental margins of Asia and Africa, and some parts of the Pacific this species was rarely observed, suggesting that populations have declined substantially in those areas.&#160;<br/><br/>Market surveys at landing sites in Indonesia (e.g., White 2007, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020) since the mid-1990s have only recorded this species in small amounts, suggesting that it has undergone substantial decline. A similar situation exists in the Philippines (<span style="""">Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017</span>) and Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018) where it is only occasionally recorded at landing sites. In other nations (e.g<span style="""">. Bangladesh - A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020; Mynamar - Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015; Malaysia - A. Bin Ali unpubl. data</span> 2020), it is known from historic records, but has not been observed in recent surveys of landing sites.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark represented &lt;1% of landings by number in the Red Sea (Yemen, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia) (Bonfil 2003,&#160;Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species was not observed in recent BRUV surveys or underwater visual surveys in this area (Kattan 2014, Spaet <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Divers in the Red Sea have reported significant declines over the past 30–40 years (J.L.Y. Spaet pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In the Gulf, this species appears to be uncommon with only one historical record reported in Saudi Arabia (Basson <em>et al. </em>1977). More recently, the species was not recorded from landing site surveys in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar (Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Moore and Peirce 2013). However, the species represented&#160;0.33% of shark landings by number in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and 0.6% of sharks by number traded through the UAE from Oman (Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2016). Marshall and Barnett (1997) reported this species as being one of the most commonly landed species in Somalia shark fisheries. It is reportedly uncommon in fisheries in Oman, India and the Maldives with no catch data available (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160;Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015,&#160;T. Al Mamari, M. Khan, and K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In Pakistan, it used to caught in large quantities using live baits, however, there has been an ~90 % decrease in catches in recent years (M. Khan pers. comm. 12 December 2020).&#160;Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, Yemen (including the Socotra Archipelago), and Somalia were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002, Glaser <em>et al. </em>2015). Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001, despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016).<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is regularly caught in small amounts as a non-target species in gillnet fisheries in the north of the country (e.g. Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Catch levels have not caused the decline of the species, and it is considered to be sustainably fished (<span style="""">Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019</span>).<br/><br/>The interpretation of the level of global population reduction is complicated by the divergent state of this species between island (limited population reduction) and continental margin (large population reductions) portions of its range. However, it is no longer observed in many parts of its range and this large area across which it has declined, compared to the habitat area available in small island nations and northern Australia where it remains healthy and thus has some refuge from fishing, suggests that the overall level of population reduction is likely to be large. Thus, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50-79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).",Decreasing,"The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is widespread in coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indian and Northwest, Western Central, and Eastern Central Pacific Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).","The meat of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is used fresh, dried, salted, frozen, or smoked. Fields <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported that Sharptooth Lemon Shark made up 0.6% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. The species is occasionally displayed in aquaria. In the Western and Central Pacific, the species is a key component of the tourism industry where diving and interactions with this shark regularly occur. It is estimated that the species generates around $5.4 million USD per year within a shark feeding ecotourism operation in French Polynesia (Clua <em>et al</em>.2011).",Marine,"There are few species-specific regulations in place to protect this species. In northern Australia, fisheries that target sharks are managed using output (i.e., effort controls) and/or Total Allowable Catches (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory). These catch limits are not species-specific, but are for sharks or subsets of shark species. There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge for reef associated sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2020) and cover significant parts of the range, especially in the Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Palau). To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large sharks in prawn and shrimp trawls (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2020). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 60 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Whitespotted Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Whitespotted Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Whitespotted Whipray&#160;occurs inshore on soft substrates<em></em> down to depths of at least 60 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 116 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 48–58 cm DW, and females mature at 63 cm DW, and size-at-birth is 13–21 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2–4 pups (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). There is no information on this species' maximum age and age-at-maturity, hence, generation length was inferred based on data for&#160;Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The Blackspotted Whipray has a smaller maximum size (80 cm DW) than the Whitespotted Whipray (116 cm DW), therefore generation length was scaled to be 25 years.","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Whitespotted Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956–2004) but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956–2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics <span lang=""EN-US"">pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Seine nets and bottom trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).</span></p><p>The Whitespotted Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In the Philippines, the Whitespotted Whipray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>In Indonesia, these small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).</span></p><p>The Whitespotted Whipray is the most commonly landed ray in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive trawl and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly et al. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of its fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased by nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg / hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).</p><p><span class=""tlid-translation"">In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length). About 6,600 trawlers are operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al. </em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently begun (2 years) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses bottom set gillnets to catch up to 6 tonnes of rays per trip (3-5 days). There are currently 20–<span class=""tlid-translation"">40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;</span></span></p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy metals) (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). There has been an estimated 10–20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</span></p>","<p>There are no population species-specific trend data for this species.&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">D</a><span lang=""EN-US"">espite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to <span lang=""EN-US"">2014 have been reconstructed for the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk20403173"">Chinese EEZ</a>, based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016).

As the human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improve, fishing effort and power are continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in the Asian region (Anticamara&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The reconstructed catch data showed a decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Chinese EEZ over 65 years, from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014, a 67% decline in less than three generation lengths. Additionally, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured in Chinese waters (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).</span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, landings data<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;are available on the combined catch of all ray species taken by bottom trawl in Da-xi, Yilan County. The landings increased by 98% over 14 years from 1993–2006 (Lee 2008). That is, from ~1 t in 1993 to ~50 t in 2006. There is no detailed concurrent effort data, however the number of trawl vessels operating in the Yilan County area during the latter part of the time-series (1999–2008) were relatively stable (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics 2019). This marked increase in rays caught by trawlers in the Yilan County from 1993–2006 is likely a reflection of an increase in reporting of the ray catch over that period, rather than an actual increase in abundance (H. Hans and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019)<strong><span lang=""EN-US"">.</span></strong></span></p><p>In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data of all combined ray species from municipal and commercial fisheries shows that annual landings rose from 4,160 t in 1976 to a peak of 10,990 t in 1991, then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017) This indicates a decrease of 76% in 16 years (less than one generation length) from 1991–2006.</p><p>Landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite the increased effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three-generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5%.</p><p>Four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>The catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Whitespotted Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>In Cambodia, this species is now considered rare but is caught in trawls, gillnets, and longlines (S. Li unpubl. data 2020). This may be indicative of historic depletions.</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998–2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 tonnes since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inferences on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p>Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort. In Viet Nam, there is a lack of species-specific data, however, reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–<span lang=""EN-US"">2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam EEZ, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in <span lang=""EN-US"">sharks, rays, and skates<span lang=""EN-US""> landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the <span lang=""EN-US"">fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).</span></span></p><p>In Bangladesh, <span lang=""EN-US"">questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. These declines have led to fishers using other net types (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” resulting in many attempts to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>This species is very&#160;rarely seen in the Gulf of Oman and has not been documented in landing surveys from Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE (Moore <em>et al. </em>2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). However, it was recently caught in research trawls surveys off the Gulf coast of the UAE (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). In Iranian waters, the species has shown sharp declines in trawl catches since 2010, but these have not been quantified (F. Owfi pers. comm. 07/02/2017). In Oman, this was one of the most commonly captured batoid species in research trawls in 2007-2008 (McCoy <em>et al.</em> 2009) but was not common in landing surveys (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p><p>In Pakistan, the species is caught in gillnet and trawl fisheries and has recently shown signs of declines of at least 30% (M. Khan pers. comm. 07/02/2017).&#160;Although this species appears in landings in both Pakistan and India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing.&#160;The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990<span lang=""EN-US"">–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, in 1990 the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 in 2004 (Raje &amp; Zacharia 2009). The Whitespotted Whipray averaged 1.22% of trawl captured in weight but trends in landings across years were not available. These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense (see Threats section), for example, between 2003<span lang=""EN-US"">–2004, 120 t of Whitespotted Whiprays were landed from trawl fisheries in northwestern India (Raje&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Trawl fisheries have expanded rapidly since then (K.V. Akhileshpers. comm. 07/02/2017) and approximately 90 tonnes of this species were captured each year along the west coast of India from 2010<span lang=""EN-US"">–2015 (S.J. Kizhakudan pers. comm. 07/02/2017).</span></span></p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Whitespotted Whipray.

They are frequently landed throughout the Southeast Asian portion of their range and the meat is consumed fresh for human consumption.&#160;</p><p>Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (Haque A.B unpubl. data 2020).</p>In the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption.&#160;In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia (M. Khan&#160;unpubl. data 2017). In India, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin where the meat of the Whitespotted Whipray is preferred (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of whiprays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Throughout Indonesia, there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia, there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km<sup>2</sup> that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983, in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). These bans and closures imply that ‘baby trawlers’ became illegal (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nautical miles from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on ""muro ami"" gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><a name=""_Hlk21689683""><span lang=""EN-US"">In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). </span></a><a name=""_Hlk21689697""></a><span lang=""EN-US"">There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019).

Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced.

It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 40 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and Bleeker's Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and the skins are desirable and are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). Overfishing of inshore habitats is evident throughout its range such that it is now considered rare in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that Bleeker's Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>Bleeker's Whipray is benthic from the surface to depths of 40 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 119 cm disc width (DW), males and females mature at ~51 cm DW and size-at-birth is ~21 cm DW (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic vivipartity with litter sizes of 1 or 2 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length was based on data for Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The maximum size of the Bleeker's Whipray  is&#160; larger (119 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted  Whipray (80 cm DW), thus it is suspected the generation length of Bleeker's  Whipray is 25 years.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, Bleeker's Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries.&#160;In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters, before a nationwide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).&#160;</p><p>The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In India, juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat.&#160;The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over one generation length).&#160; About 6,600 trawlers were operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2006).&#160;</span></p><p>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 tons per year with 170,000 tons (per year) from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 tons from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg / hr in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fibreglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast&#160;(Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20-25 days (NARA 2003).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).&#160;</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Despite the lack of species-specific trend data, landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak.&#160;</p><p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite the constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths, this indicates a suspected population reduction 94–97.5% (75 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species.</p><p>Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. dat<a>a</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>In Sri Lanka, overall reconstructed landings have increased 4-fold from 150,000 t in 195 to 500,000 t in the 2000s (O’Meara <em>et al. </em>2011). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but these fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished because “it became clear that the coastal sector had limited capacity for further expansion” resulting in many attempts were made to expand the fishing more towards the offshore areas (Dissanayake 2005).</p><p>Although this species appears to be common in Pakistan and India, the population is suspected to have declined due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period, trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). Bleeker's Whipray was the most dominant species landed during this period with an average annual landing of 250 t, at a catch rate 0.18 kg h<sup>-1&#160;</sup>constituting 51.1% of the ray landings. However, the catch decreased from 371.0 t in 1993-95 to 148.0 t in 2002–04 (Raje and Zacharia 2009; as&#160;<em>Himantura alcockii</em>). This would be a ~95%&#160;decline if extrapolated over a period of three generation spans (75 years) of Bleeker's Whipray.&#160;These declines are likely representative of the broader situation across large parts of the species' range, where fishing pressure is intense (see Threats section), for example, between 2003–2004, 1,391 t of Bleeker's Whiprays were landed from trawl fisheries in northwestern India (Raje&#160;<em style=""font-family: Times; font-size: medium;"">et al.</em>&#160;2007). Ongoing fishing is suspected to result in continuing population declines in the future.&#160;</p><p>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Bleeker's Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Bleeker's Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).</p>",Decreasing,"Bleeker's Whipray occurs in the Western and Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Pakistan to Malaysia (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Krajangdara 2019, A.

This species is sometimes landed in the markets in Singapore, where catch from Indonesia and Malaysia is landed&#160;(N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). They are infrequently landed in Bangladesh, though desirable due to their size, and the skin is exported to Myanmar (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The meat is consumed both locally and exported.&#160;Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export.

Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure. In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015).</p><p>There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).</p><p>Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, Sri Lanka does not have trawl fisheries. However, incidental catches likely occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). In India, the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park and Sunderbans biosphere reserve could protect this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Further research is needed on population size and trends, life history, and catch rates should be monitored throughout this species’ range.</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global
175221157,161547,Pateobatis uarnacoides,Endangered,A2d,2020,2020-05-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whitenose Whipray (<em>Pateobatis uarnacoides</em>) is a medium-sized (to 119 cm disc width (DW)) ray that is widespread in the Eastern Indian and Western Pacific Oceans from Bangladesh to Java, Indonesia and Viet Nam. It is demersal in inshore and brackish waters from the surface to depths of 75 m. Whiprays larger than 100 cm DW have limited biological productivity and the Whitespotted Whipray has an inferred generation length of 25 years. The meat is considered to be of good quality and is consumed locally and traded internationally, and their skins are processed into leather. There is a long history of overfishing inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ entire range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all whiprays from both Malaysia and Indonesia can be used to infer declines of 45–99% over the past three generation lengths (75 years). In Thailand, ray landings have decreased by 78% in 8 years, a significant decrease in less than one generation length. Overfishing of inshore habitats is evident throughout its range such that it is now considered rare in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure which is high and increasing across its range resulting in severe declines and localised disappearances. It is suspected that the Whitenose Whipray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","<p>The Whitenose Whipray is demersal on soft habitats from the surface to 75 m (Weigmann<em>&#160;</em>2016). It reaches a maximum size of 119 cm disc width (DW), males mature at 50 cm DW and size-at-birth is 18 cm DW (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy (White <em>et al. </em>2006). Little else is known of its biology. Generation length was based on data for Blackspotted Whipray (<em>Maculabatis astra</em>) (Jacobsen and Bennett 2011). Female Blackspotted Whipray have a maximum age of 29 years and an  age-at-maturity of nine years and thus, a generation length of 19 years  (Jacobsen and Bennett 2010). The maximum size of the Whitenose Whipray  is&#160; larger (119 cm DW) than that of the Blackspotted  Whipray (80 cm DW), thus it is suspected the generation length of Whitenose Whipray  is 25 years.</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout its distribution, the Whitenose Whipray is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence  fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet,  lift net, longline, push net, and traps and it is retained for human  consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020). The Whitenose Whipray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).</p><p>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, the effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprised over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). S<span class=""tlid-translation"">tingrays contribute the most (more than 95%) to elasmobranch catch by danish seines (cantrang) operating in the Java Sea (Fahmi&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""tlid-translation"">&#160;2008).<span class=""tlid-translation""></span></p><p>The Whitenose Whipray is one of the most commonly landed rays in the gill and tangle net fisheries in Indonesian waters (D’Alberto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). These fisheries, along with trawling, are particularly intensive in the Arafura Sea region (W. White pers. comm. 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further south to maintain catches (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Although the numbers of trawlers currently operating is unclear, this intensive fishing pressure still continues; high levels of Indonesian trawl fishing in the Arafura Sea adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone has been reported (Heazle and Butcher 2007, Northern Territory Government 2009), in addition to intensive trawl and gillnetting throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operating throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the actual level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.</p><p>In Malaysia, fisheries significantly contribute to the national economy through employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. Fisheries operating within 30 nm from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 GT. In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. These fisheries have contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).</p><p>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 Kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 Kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).</p><p>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004 large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Mizrahi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale and include many subsistence level fishers. This species is the third most commonly landed species in Myanmar (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). At times since 1950 significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners.&#160;International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). The marine capture fisheries of Bangladesh exploit a complex, multi-species resource, and can be subdivided into subsistence (small-scale, non-commercial), artisanal (small-scale, commercial) and industrial (large-scale, commercial) fisheries sectors. Among the commercial catch, more than 90% is landed by artisanal fishing vessels, while industrial fisheries contribute around 6% to the total landed catch (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Each trawling vessel is equipped with trawl gear as well as bottom set longline gear to target shark and rays. There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. Many trawlers in the SW region of the country will go out to sea for more than 15 days and return with greater landings of larger ray species (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). It is believed that there may be nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>There is a large amount of Illegal, Ureported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).</p><p>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also indirectly threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>","<p>There is no species-specific population trend data for this species. Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates are available for the Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. The reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).</p>Landings data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, Western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. Despite the lack of species-specific data, landing data from 1950 to 2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian EEZ.<p>In Eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, a time-span of less than one generation length, despite a still increasing fishing effort. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this decrease is equivalent to 93%. In Western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65%. In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016), or a decrease of ~92% when scaled to three generation lengths (75 years). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (75 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 92–97.5%.</p><p>Four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for Eastern Indonesia, Central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’). Finally, research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea can be used to show changes in relative abundance.</p><p>Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In Eastern Indonesia, the catch has since decreased by 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 tper year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased by 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber <em>et al. </em>2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (one generation length) (Blaber <em>et al.</em> 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia, there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Whitenose Whiprays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (75 years).</p><p>There are no species-specific ray landings in Thailand, however, data are available on combined ray landings from 1998 to 2018. Ray landings peaked in 2003 with over 18,000 t reported but rapidly decreased and have been under 4,000 t since 2011, a decrease of ~78% in 8 years (Krajangdara 2019) and 100% when scaled to three generation lengths (75 years).&#160;</p><p>In Myanmar, there is limited species-specific landings data available, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of IUU fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places them in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns about the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.</p><p>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals. This has led to fishers using other net types because of the large decline in ray catches (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in whiprays or rays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Whitenose Whipray. Overall, it is suspected that the Whitenose Whipray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (75 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Whitenose Whipray is found in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans from Bangladesh to Java, Indonesia and to Viet Nam (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).","<p>The Whitenose Whipray is used for its meat and skin (A. Bin Ali and Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). The meat is consumed fresh or salted and dried. This species is also landed and sold in the markets in Singapore, which are landed from Indonesia and Malaysian waters&#160;(N. Clark-Shen pers. comm. 06/05/2020). Larger rays, like this species, are very desirable in Bangladesh for their meat and skin. Ray meat is consumed locally and exported. The skins from large rays are exported to Myanmar to be made into accessories (e.g. handbags). Smaller rays are retained for their meat but the skins are too small to be utilized. Small rays are often dried whole for local consumption and export. There has been some increase in the demand for ray meat in cosmopolitan areas and restaurants (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>No specific measures are in place. In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance are limited (Teh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020).</p><p>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al. </em>1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari, 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.</p><p>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 gross t are prohibited to fish within three nautical miles from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2001 the government banned the capture and sale of whale shark (Notification 2/2001), and in 2004 established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008 a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher pers. comm. 2020).</p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>","",,false,false,Global

It is benthopelagic in inshore waters from the surface to depths of 50 m. It is taken as target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with a wide range of gears and is retained for the meat which is consumed locally and traded internationally and in some countries used for fish meal production. There is a long history of overfishing of inshore populations and fishing pressure remains high, and may be rising, across the species’ range. There are no species-specific time series, although landings data of all elasmobranchs, rays and whiprays from across its range&#160;infer declines of 40–98% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). This species has minimal refuge from fishing pressure and its habitat has also been degraded by urban development and agriculture. It is possible locally extinct in Viet Nam and Cambodia. It is suspected that the Oman Cownose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to actual levels of exploitation and a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","The Oman Cownose Ray is benthopelagic over the continental shelf, mostly inshore from the surface to depths of 50 m (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016, Weigmann 2016).

The species form large aggregations, similar to another member of their genus the Javanese Cownose Ray (<em>R. javanica</em>) (James 1962, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). As there is no information on the age-at-maturity and maximum age of this species, generation length is estimated to be 10 years based on the slightly larger (110 cm DW) American Cownose Ray (<em>R. bonasus</em>) (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p></p>The Oman Cownose Ray in taken as target and bycatch in coastal industrial and artisanal fisheries fisheries throughout its range by a range of gears including demersal trawl, purse seines, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is retained for human consumption or for fish meal. The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). However, since the 1970s, most of the Taiwan global shark catch is from Taiwan fishing vessels operating in distant waters outside Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>The Oman Cownose Ray is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam and Cambodia, if it is still extant in the two countries. There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~78,000 vessels) but also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Oman Cownose Ray is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries and all incidental catch appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s and by the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) (Palomares et al. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili et al. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Malaysia, this species is now considered very rare and only juveniles are observed at landing sites, indicating a likely decline in recent years (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly et al. 2020). Consequently, fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Nevertheless, fish consumption continues to rise and most (~85%) comes from the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale inshore fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption. In Thailand, the gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, <em>Rhinoptera </em>spp. are caught in large abundances in purse seines, up to 10,000 kg/year (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher; foreign vessels were banned in 2014. In Bangladesh, this species is among one of the most abundant rays landed frequently in longlines and setbag nets amongst other modified gill nets (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). There has been an increase in fishing vessels over the past 10 years. It is believed that there may be a number of nursery areas around coastal Bangladesh. Sharks and rays landed in the pre-monsoon season are often pregnant and near term. This period overlaps with significant fishing pressure (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, this species is caught mostly in gillnets and demeral set gillnets in artisanal coastal fisheries (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020). Coastal fisheries account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts operate and of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines (Wijayaratne 2001, NARA 2003). In India, <em>Rhinoptera </em>spp. have been caught regularly in the mixed species fishery by a large suite of gears. Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported Rhinoptera spp. formed 8% of rays landed at Chennai, Bay of Bengal during the 2002–2006 period, in which trawls were the major gear used and the annual catch ranged between 33–120 t. Juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. There are approximately 24,554 trawl vessels operating in the Indian part of the species' range (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). The shallow depth distribution means this species is unlikely to have a depth refuge. There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years (just over two generation lengths) (CMFRI 2010). A ray fishery has recently began (two years ago) in the Andaman and Nicobar islands and uses demersal set gillnets to catch up to 6 t of rays/ trip (3–5 days). There are currently 20–40 boats operating in this fishery (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Pakistan, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf areas, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>This species comprised 3% of all elasmobranch landings (by number) along the eastern coast of the Red Sea (Saudi Arabia) where only juveniles were caught (Spaet and Berumen 2015). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the species comprised 59.4% of examined batoid landings (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2019). The species was not observed during landing surveys in Bahrain, while small numbers were observed in Kuwait (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012; although larger numbers of unidentified Rhinoptera spp. where also reported). It is caught in trawl fisheries off Somalia (M. Ali unpubl. data 2019), and likely elsewhere that is undocumented.<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, overall catches reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999 suggesting stocks are fully fished. There is concern for serial depletion with the number species landed near-doubling from only 85 in 1971 to 152 reported in 2000 (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are underreported and most small scale/artisanal/subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or overexploited, especially where they are found close to population centres. Over the last ten years, the number of underexploited fisheries in the coastal zone has tended to decline and such fisheries are now an exception (FAO 2006, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of illegali, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey et al. 2010). This species’ preference for coastal waters means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation, including pollution and clearing, and destructive fishing practices. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in Indonesia and Malaysia through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture. Across Indonesia and Malaysia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160; In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945–1995 (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995). Marine habitats in the Arabian Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""><span class=""tlid-translation""></span></span></span></p>","<p>  </p>The ranges of this species and the Javanese Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera javanica</em>) overlap, and identification is problematic with species-specific information typically not available. Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the Chinese and Viet Nam Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase. In Viet Nam, the reconstructed catch data showed an 97% decline from 1986–2014. Catches peaked at 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines can be inferred to represent reductions in the populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Oman Cownose Ray (30 years) they represent declines of 40% and 98% in China and Viet Nam, respectively.<br/><br/>In Taiwan and Thailand, landings data are available on the combined catch of all skate and ray species, respectively, and in the Philippines reconstructed catch data is available for all ray species. In Taiwan, landings data indicate an 80% decrease over 49 years from 1953–2001. The annual landings rose from 560 t tonne in 1953 to a peak of 1,800 t in 1973, then declined steadily to the 114 t in 2001 (Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Across Taiwan, both industrial and artisanal fishing effort have increased substantially since the 1950s, and these declines can be inferred to represent reductions in the skate populations. In Thailand, landings data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003–2018. Catches rose steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a steady decline in catches to ~2,000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003–2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort. In the Philippines, reconstructed catch data showed a 76% decline in 16 years from 1991–2006. Catches peaked at 10,990 t in 1991 and then declined to 2,600 t in 2006 (NFRDI 2017). This infers a population reduction as fishing effort increased during this period. When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Oman Cownose Ray (30 years) they represent declines of 63% and 94% in Taiwan and the Philippines, respectively.<br/><br/>Landings data from 1950–2014 are available on combined whipray species from fisheries within the Malaysian and Indonesian EEZs. While not a species of whipray, the Javanese Cownose Ray is caught in similar gears, thus the trends in whiprays is suspected to be similar to that of this species. There are four lines of evidence throughout Malaysia that can be used to infer population trends including catch reconstructions for eastern Peninsular Malaysia, western Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In eastern Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased starting in the late 1960s reaching a peak of over 13,000 t in 1999. Catch since decreased and was ~7,700 t in 2014, a 53% decrease in 15 years, despite a still increasing fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In western Peninsular Malaysia, whipray catches increased throughout the 1960s. Catch oscillated between 7,000 and 13,000 t until 2009 where it stabilized at ~6,500 t for five years, a decrease of ~65% (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sabah, whipray catches steadily increased from 1950 to 1994. In 1995, whipray catch peaked at ~11,550 t. It has since decreased to just over 6,000 t, despite constant effort, equivalent to an inferred population decrease of ~60% over 19 years (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Sarawak, there was a 37.5-fold increase from ~200 t per year in the mid-1960s to ~7,500 t in the mid-1970s. The catch remained high for less than a decade before declining to under 3,000 t per year for 10 years, despite increasing effort. A population reduction of at least 50% can be inferred through this time. Catch then increased again to over 6,000 t per year, coinciding with a steep increase in effort, before decreasing to ~4,500 t per year since 2004. Since the initial peak of whipray catch in Sarawak in 1997 at 7,700 t, there has been a 52% decrease (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Overall, in Malaysia, whiprays are suspected to have been reduced by over 50% across all regions in the past 10–20 years. When scaled to three generation lengths (30 years), this indicates a suspected population reduction of 64–98%.<br/><br/>There are four lines of evidence throughout Indonesia that can be used to infer population trends, three catch reconstructions and a research survey trend: catch reconstruction for eastern Indonesia, central Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean portion of Indonesian EEZ specifically western Sumatra and southern Java (hereafter ‘Indian Ocean’), and research survey data in 1976 and 1997 in the Java Sea. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In eastern Indonesia, catch has since decreased 45% between 1998 at 300 t and the early 2000s to the most recent catch estimate of 167 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 t to &gt;200 t per year (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Catches are still increasing in the Indian Ocean; however, this increase may be related to increasing fishing effort and demand for rays in the area and likely does not reflect the actual population trend (Blaber et al. 2009). These rising catches are unsustainable and instead arise from shifts in fishing effort into deeper waters due to decreased catch closer to shore (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Finally, research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, CPUE is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007). Considering these catch trends, the suspected population reduction of Oman Cownose Rays in Indonesia is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general fisheries catches (all species, not just rays) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950, there are significant concerns for the status of many species. Trawl surveys in Myanmar undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel 'Dr Fridtjof Nansen' in 1978–80 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad <em>et al</em>. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Declines in ray catch rates declined more than for sharks. Surveys of local markets from 2006 to 2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, questionnaires of local fishers revealed a steep decline in rays in the past 10 years (Ullah <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly et al. 2020). Fishers reported that when fishing for larger rays ten years ago, a 7-day trip would yield over 1,000 individuals. Recent 7-day fishing trips now only yield 2–5 large ray individuals (A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In India, fishing effort is on the rise (Dineshbabu 2013). Historically, this species appear to be abundant, for e.g., James (1962), reported a landing of large number rays (&gt;1,000) within two weeks. In the south east coasts of India and adjoining waters of Sri Lanka this species was seen in large aggregations before the mechanisation of vessels. The annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled consequently in 1990 and the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This is approximately an 86% decline over a period of three generation lengths (30 years). Although this information is not species-specific, and the proportion of cownose rays in the catch in unknown, it provides a good indication of ray declines in India. A general reduction in elasmobranch catch per effort has been reported from India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), which could be applicable to this species. In Pakistan, while specific data are lacking, dramatic declines have occurred in cownose ray landings since 1999 (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>Actual levels of exploitation are high across the range of this species and declines in elasmobranch, rays, and whiprays can be considered representative of population reduction of the Oman Cownose Ray. These declines ranged from 40–98% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) of the Oman Cownose Ray. Overall, it is suspected that the Oman Cownose Ray has undergone a 50–79% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (30 years).",Decreasing,The Oman Cownose Ray is widely distributed throughout the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans from Mozambique to Japan (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).,"The flesh of the Oman Cownose Ray is valuable and used fresh or salted and is consumed locally or exported dried (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010, A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In the Gulf of Oman this species is of low value and likely to be discarded. However, it is utilized in Pakistan and India. The meat is usually sold either fresh or dried for human consumption. In Pakistan, the wings (pectoral fins) of adults are frozen and exported to Thailand and Malaysia or used as raw material for fish meal production (M. Khan unpubl. data 2020). In India, elasmobranchs are consumed historically and in the southern state of Kerala, there is a specialized market selling only rays in Thalassery, north of Cochin (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2017). The skin of whiprays is often processed and used for leather in India (R.W. Jabado unpubl. data 2017). Ray meat, both fresh and dry salted, is increasing in demand and therefore price in India.",Marine,"<p></p>No specific measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Sea to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon et al. 2012). In Taiwan, there are ~32 Protected Areas which cover ~38% of the Taiwan coastline and ~47% of Taiwan territorial seas, with no-entry and no-take areas accounting for 0.9% and 4.6% of the territorial seas, respectively (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012, Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). There is a prohibition on using any net fishing gear (e.g. trawls, seine nets) in 68 reef areas (Fisheries Agency 2019). Since 1999, all bottom trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao et al. 2019). Since the mid–2000s, gillnets have been banned within 3 nm in parts of five counties with a policy of gradual removal of gillnets from within 3 nm of the entire coast and government assistance to transition to line and troll fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Viet Nam, there is a prohibition on destructive fishing practices, and some fisheries regulations, however, enforcement and compliance is limited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are at least three Marine Protected Areas (Hon Mun, Cu Lao Cham, and Con Dao) with an aim to preserve 2% of the marine area (FAO 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines in 1981, there were 5-year closures of the trawl and purse seine fisheries in the waters of Bohol, Cebu, and Negros Oriental and in 1983 in Batangas (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). In 1998, active fishing gears, including trawlers, ‘baby trawlers’, purse seines, and tuna longlines, were prohibited within municipal marine waters (&lt;3 nm from shore). In 1998, a ban was also legislated on muro ami gear (an encircling net and pounding devices) and other gear destructive to coral reefs and marine habitats (FAO 2020b). Trawlers within commercial waters have been required since 2010 to use Juvenile and Trashfish Excluder Devices under the Fisheries Administrative Order 237 series of 2010. (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020), which may reduce the retention of larger sharks and rays (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the Philippines, there are ~&gt;1,800 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (NFRDI 2017, CTI 2020). Some of these MPAs are known to provide shark and ray protection including Donsol, Malapascua, Cagayancillo MPAs, and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park (NFRDI 2017, Murray et al. 2018).<br/><br/>In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km² that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). In Malaysia there are 51 MPAs making up 5,462 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region, however, are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In Thailand, all commercial fishing vessels greater than 10 Gross Tonnage are prohibited within three nm from the shore (DoF 2015). There has been limited management of shark and rays in Myanmar. In 2004, the government established two shark reserves in the Myeik Archipelago where targeting sharks is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard et al. 2015). Rays are protected from targeting by the shark reserves. In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of it in fishing communities (MacKeracher <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Kuwait is the only country across the range of this species with regulations specifically banning catches of rays. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. Furthermore, there are no trawl fisheries in Sri Lanka.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest measures. Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 60–100 m. The species is taken as bycatch by demersal longlines and demersal gillnets and retained for the meat which is consumed locally and for the fins that are traded internationally. There is a long history of overfishing across Indonesia and declines in elasmobranch catches suggest declines of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) of the species in Indonesia. Its Indonesian distribution is adjacent to heavily populated areas, making it easily accessible to fishers. However, the species likely has some refuge in the Nicobar Islands.<br/><br/>The Indonesian Houndshark has a small area of occupancy (AOO) of ~72 km² and occurs in two locations with continuing declines inferred in the number of mature individuals. It is suspected that the Indonesian Houndshark has undergone a global population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to actual levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered A2d; B2ab(v).","The Indonesian Houndshark is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 60–100 m (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013). It reaches a maximum size of 129 cm total length (TL), males mature at 92–95 cm TL and females mature at ~100 cm TL, and size-at-birth is 28–30 cm TL (White <em>et al. </em>2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ebert&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013, Sentosa and Chodrijah). Reproduction is viviparous with histotrophy with litter sizes of 6–11 pups and size-at-birth of 28–30 cm TL (White <em>et al. </em>2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ebert&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013). As there is no information on the age-at-maturity or maximum age of this species, generation length was inferred to be 10 years based on the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>), which attains a similar maximum size of 120 cm TL (Yamada 1986, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28 August 2019).","The Indonesian Houndshark is caught as bycatch in demersal longline and demersal gillnets which operate both inshore and in deepwater areas (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). This species is especially susceptible to heavy fishing pressure as its current known area of occupancy (AOO) is limited to ~72 km² and this does not include any refuge areas (CTI 2020). The Indonesian distribution occurs between two heavily populated cities, making it easily accessible to fishers. From March 2010 to January 2011, only 114 individuals were found, despite market surveys looking for this species (Faizah <em>et al.</em> 2012). Many of these individuals were juveniles, indicating the possibility of recruitment overfishing occurring for this species. In a later survey of artisanal fishers in Lombok in January-December 2016 and April and July 2017, 454 individuals were observed with most of the individuals also juveniles (Sentosa and Chodrijah 2020) and the first estimation of growth indicating the species likely has a slow growth rate (Sentosa and Chodrijah 2020). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most  (~90%) of  fisheries  production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by  these  small-scale  fisheries has tripled when taking population growth  into  account  (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important  resource in  Indonesia  and are the main livelihood for some communities  (Sadili <em>et al</em>.   2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense  with the largest   chondrichthyan fishery globally and the country has  been among the top  shark  fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and  Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands there are currently 2,784 fishing vessels active including 7,034 licensed fishers (Tyabji <em>et al.</em> 2020). These vessels target sharks and rays using pelagic and deep-water longlines. Additionally, sharks are caught as bycatch by longlines, trawlers, gillnets, and hook and line (Tyabji&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Near Campbell Bay on Great Nicobar Island, where this species occurs, there are ~20 commercial vessels in operation in addition to artisanal fishers, thus, this area may provide some refuge from fishing pressure (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).","<a name=""_Hlk20403143"">There are no species-specific population trend estimates.

In the Indian Ocean within the Indonesian EEZ, elasmobranch catches increased in the mid-1960s to early-1970s with catches peaking at 955 t before plummeting to less than 200 t until 1995. Catches peaked again in 1998 at 969 t and have since declined to less than 35 t in 2013 and 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). This represents a 99% decline when scaled to three generation lengths (30 years) of the Indonesian Hounshark. Although these catches include all elasmobranch species, is it suspected to be indicative of the population trend of the Indonesian Houndshark.&#160;This species is found in a small area in Indonesia that is easily accessible to fishers from both Bali and Lombok, both heavily populated areas.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands EEZ, catches of sharks, rays, and skates began to increase in the early 1990s and rose from ~250 t to 2,275 t in 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches are still increasing in the region, however, effort is also increasing with large-scale targeted shark and ray fisheries beginning in the 1980s (Tyabji <em>et al. </em>2018).

176493270,166184,Anguilla japonica,Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla japonica</em> is a facultatively catadromous (Tsukamoto and Arai 2001), semelparous (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011) fish species with multiple life stages and is assumed to be panmictic (<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Ishikawa <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2001, Han <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Minegishi <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</span></span></p><p>Available data for glass, yellow and silver eels (see ‘Population’ section) indicate that this species has declined in abundance across its range by at least 50% over the last 24 years (<em>ca</em>. three generations). As such, <em>A. japonica</em> has been assessed as Endangered (EN) under A2bcd. In brackish water areas of Japan, where naturally-recruited wild eels are dominant, declining trends have been observed in yellow and silver eel CPUE data (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em><em>, </em>Kaifu and Yokouchi<em> </em>2019). Regression analysis showed that silver eel catches in Okayama prefecture, Japan decreased 99.0% in 13 years (2002–2015), and long-line and set-net CPUEs of naturally-recruited wild yellow eel in the same prefecture also decreased 79.6% and 79.5%, respectively, in 13 years (2003–2016) (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). For glass eels, catch data are potentially biased due to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) exploitation (Kaifu 2019). Thus, landings data of glass eels cannot be accepted as a precise measure of population status (Kaifu 2019). However, due to the large scale of landings data, it can to some extent reflect true changes in fishing yields and is still helpful to understand stock status. Glass eel data gathered from nine prefectures in Japan indicated CPUE has declined by 47.2% over three generations. </p><p><a name=""_Hlk7697020"">Determining changes in abundance is particularly challenging due to a considerable lack of fisheries-independent monitoring data for eels in East Asia. For this assessment, fisheries standardised catch per unit effort (CPUE) was predominantly used and catch data from countries/regions across the distribution of <em>A. japonica </em>were also considered.<em> </em>The quality and quantity of data is disproportionate across the species’ range with the most extensive data sets coming from Japan. It is generally agreed that more fisheries-independent monitoring of eel populations is required throughout the range of the Japanese Eel. However, until such data become available, a precautionary assessment of trends in the fisheries time series data is necessary to highlight potential threats and apparent trends, as a guide for future research and conservation. Furthermore, as with some other anguillid species, the available data relating to <em>A. japonica</em> is predominantly from freshwater, where stocking can occur. In Japan, Japanese Eels are fished in both inland and coastal waters (Hakoyama <em>et al</em>. 2016), therefore coastal areas in Japan offer opportunities to investigate the population dynamics of naturally-recruited wild eels (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>).</a> There is currently one stock assessment study of <em>A. japonica</em> (Tanaka <em>et al</em>. 2014), although within this, the effects of stocking in inland fisheries were not considered. Data on eel biological characteristics (survival rate, growth rate and sex ratio), essential for assessment of population dynamics, differ significantly between wild and cultured-and-stocked eels. </p><p>Across East Asia, <em>A. japonica</em> is an important fishery resource with a long tradition of use and has high economic and cultural value. As such, one proposed driver of declines is unsustainable exploitation for consumption and stocking culture facilities. Another factor that has been proposed as causing declines in the Japanese Eel is short term changes in oceanic conditions (e.g., El Niño, typhoons, mid-scale eddies, bifurcation, global warming) which influence larval survival or transport (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012). These in turn are potentially exacerbated by multiple and more localised threats that include barriers to upstream and downstream migration (e.g. Tatsukawa 2003, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2020, Shuai <em>et al</em>. 2020), loss of habitat (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2014), pollution caused by industrial and agricultural runoff (Arai 2014), and modifications to coastal, riverine and other habitats (Yoshimura <em>et al</em>. 2005, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>). Our understanding of the individual and cumulative impacts of all these threats is poor and mitigating them in isolation is unlikely to have a significant effect on the species’ status. </p><p>There has been progress towards implementing conservation and management interventions within the species range. The capture of silver eel was prohibited or restricted in ten prefectures&#160;in Japan, with the intention of preserving spawning eels in these areas.&#160;Co-operation between Japan, China and Taiwan, Province of China in relation to improving the status of the Japanese Eel started in 2012, aimed at establishing strengthened fisheries management as well as introducing traceability schemes. In September 2014, a ‘Joint Statement’ was adopted by mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, for the conservation and management of the Japanese Eel, through a restriction on the amount of wild-caught glass eels that can be used in aquaculture production (Anonymous&#160;2014).&#160;</p><p>          </p><p>Assessment of the species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as a leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>The species is catadromous, spending its lifetime in freshwater, estuaries and coastal environments, including rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, but it migrates thousands of kilometres to spawn. While anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and movements. The proportion of yellow eels that remain in saline waters, rarely, if ever, entering fresh water, is particularly poorly understood which makes management challenging. </p><p>Little is known about the marine component of anguillid life histories in general, but <em>Anguilla japonica</em> stands alone in having a relatively well-studied spawning ecology (Kimura and Tsukamoto 2006, Tsukamoto 2009, Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Japanese Eel’s spawning area has been identified as the region along the western side of the seamount chain of the Mariana Ridge (Tsukamoto 1992, 2006, 2009, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2003). Recent studies, based on data from pop-up archival tags, indicate that <em>A. japonica</em> exhibits diel vertical migrations as it swims to the spawning site that occurs in response to light intensity and water temperature (Manabe <em>et al.</em> 2011, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018, Higuchi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The speed of migration was found to be between 18.4–40.6 km/d (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018). The average migration speed in this study was faster than in previous studies – between 2.2 and 15.1 km/d was estimated by Manabe <em>et al</em>. (2011) – possibly due to environmental factors affecting the route (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Eggs and spawning adults have been discovered in the west of Mariana Ridge (Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The depths where adults and newly hatched larvae were captured indicate that spawning occurs from 150–200 m (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p><p>Leptocephali develop in the pelagic ocean environment and over the course of five to six months they drift towards their estuarine recruitment areas in oceanic currents (Kuroki <em>et al.</em> 2009, Shinoda <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fukuda <em>et al.</em> (2018) collected metamorphosing leptocephali from the mesoscale eddy region to the East of Taiwan and found the onset of metamorphosis into glass eels occurs when leptocephali reach 67.8 ± 2.7 mm, at an age of 137 ± 15 days. This study also highlighted that <em>A. japonica</em> may recruit through the mesoscale eddies in addition to direct transfer from the North Equatorial Current to the Kuroshio. Models using virtual larvae have also suggested an importance of mesoscale eddies in <em>A. japonica</em> larval migration (Chang <em>et al</em>. 2017). Pigmentation stages of <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels are described by Fukuda <em>et al.</em> (2013). Age upon arrival to estuaries is estimated between 154 and 182 days while age at metamorphosis from larvae to glass eels is between 115–137 days (Cheng and Tzeng 1996). Therefore, time from metamorphosis to estuarine arrival is thought to be between 32 and 45 days (Cheng and Tzeng 1996). A full description of the timing of glass eel recruitment to different geographic regions is given in the ‘Geographic Range’ section. Glass eels utilise flood tidal streams selectively at night to migrate inshore in coastal areas (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2016). The subsequent timing of upstream migration of glass eels depends on the water temperature, tidal current and moon phase (Tzeng 1985). </p><p>After reaching coastal waters, a proportion of the population then moves upstream to feed and grow. However, some <em>A. japonica,</em>&#160;referred to as marine residents or ‘sea eels’, never enter freshwater, and remain in estuaries or nearby marine habitats (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 1998). Analysis of the strontium:calcium ratios within the otoliths of maturing eels reveals a signature of the transition between these environments and it has been estimated that substantial proportions (56–86%) of the eels in some areas might be estuarine/marine residents (Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2002, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2008, Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mochioka <em>et al</em>. 2012, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2012). This suggests that there is flexibility in the continental migration of <em>A. japonica</em>, and an ability to adapt to various habitats and salinities. When newly recruiting juveniles grow to yellow eel stage in saline waters, they are likely to become estuarine/marine residents due to a developmental shift in salinity preference (Fukuda <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p><p>During their growth phase, <em>A. japonica</em> feed mostly on invertebrates such as benthic crustaceans and insect larvae, and also on small fishes (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Itakura <em>et al.</em> (2015b) found differences in feeding habits of eels in rivers with natural shore areas when compared to revetment areas. Overall, in natural shore areas there was a greater prey diversity consumed. Terrestrial oligochaetes were observed only in the diet of eels from areas with natural shores, whereas bivalves were consumed more in areas where there was revetment. The maximum size this species attains is approximately 100 cm TL and 1.5 kg in weight (Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2007). In a survey of yellow stage <em>A. japonica</em> in nine prefectures in Japan, growth rate (mm/year) was 96.7 ± 38.6 for females (n = 3643), and 120.5 ± 65.4 for males (n = 907) (Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). </p><p>Yellow stage <em>A. japonica</em> have been found to exhibit dormancy in freshwater during winter, with little activity occurring at temperatures below 13°C (Itakura <em>et al.</em> 2017). Eels tracked over the period of a year displayed small ranges and a homing ability that allowed them to return to their original habitat from as far as 1 km away (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2017). Onset of spawning migration in silver eels has been linked to lunar periodicity, and silver eel activity has been found to be highest during the new moon period (Sudo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Experimental results indicate that silver <em>A. japonica</em> may use geomagnetic cues for orientation back to their natal water for spawning (Nishi <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>As with many eel species, the generation times for <em>A. japonica</em> are highly variable depending on sex, individual variation and locality/latitude. For example, Kotake <em>et al</em>. (2007) studied <em>A. japonica</em> from three different latitudes and found that the age of silver males ranged from 4 to 10 years and silver females from 3 to 17 years. Other studies on the average age of silver-phase Japanese Eels, provide estimates of 6.9 and&#160;7.8 years (Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2005), 8.3 and 9.9 years (Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2009), and 4.4 and 5.5 years (Xie <em>et al</em>. 2010) for male and female eels, respectively. <a name=""_Hlk16766248"">The mean age of female and male silver eels was estimated at 7.7 and 6.6 years, respectively, based on Kotake <em>et al</em>. (2005), Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. (2009) and Xie <em>et al</em>. (2010), considering sample size of each study. The total average for both male and female silver eels from these studies, considering sample size, was 7.4 years. This gives an estimated generation length of 8.4 years, inclusive of one year for migration – for the purpose of consistency with other assessments, this was rounded to eight years.</a></p><p>                </p><p>Note: <em>Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</em></p><p></p>","<p><a name=""_Hlk531096975""><em>Anguilla </em></a><em>japonica</em>,<em> </em>as with all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby<em> et al.</em> 2015). It is therefore important to highlight, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of pressures, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to threats in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>Unsustainable fishing of <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels to stock farming facilities on a national/international scale may constitute a major threat to the population. Farms meet over 90% of global demand for eel products and all seed for farms come from the wild stock (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). Declines in <em>A. japonica </em>have driven culture facilities to source glass eels of other species from elsewhere in Asia (e.g. <em>A. bicolor</em> and <em>A. marmorata</em>), Europe (<em>A. anguilla</em>) and the Americas (<em>A. rostrata</em>) (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, the threat from unsustainable fishing persists, as <em>A. japonica</em> remains the preferred species in East Asia, and the species of choice for consumption in Japan (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). High demand for <em>A. japonica</em> glass eels has resulted in dramatic increases in price in recent years (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2019<em>a</em>). In addition, ongoing illegal fishing and trade, mainly in glass eels, makes it difficult to evaluate the true impact of exploitation on the species (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>Restocking occurs in Japan (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2010), and recent research is beginning to highlight the scale of stocking in certain localities, through quantifying the proportion of stocked eels in inland waters (Ministry of Environment 2016, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019). During the 1960s, dispersal of <em>A. anguilla</em> imported to Japan for farming occurred, either through escape from culture ponds, or by mixing with <em>A. japonica</em> released for stocking. A genetic study by Arai <em>et al</em>. (2017) found <em>A. anguilla</em> was dominant in the uppermost sample site of the Tone river system. Interspecific competition of this species with <em>A. japonica</em> may pose a threat, due to similarities in functional morphology and similar niche preference. This threat will diminish as the number of European Eels in Japanese waters has substantially decreased over time (Okamura <em>et al</em>. 2008) and the species is very unlikely to successfully escape and spawn outside of its natural range. The exotic <em>A. rostrata</em> has also been found in Taiwan, after being imported at the glass eel stage for farming, and subsequently escaping from aquaculture ponds (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2009). This could present a risk of interspecific hybridisation, although successful spawning is unlikely due to species specific migration routes (Han <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>Environmental fluctuations, such as changes in ocean circulation, and El Niño, have been proposed to influence larval transport and survival, and as a consequence, the recruitment of glass eels to coastal and freshwater habitats (Kimura <em>et al</em>. 2001, Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012, Chang <em>et al</em>. 2016, Lin <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Chang <em>et al.</em> 2018, Hsiung <em>et al</em>. 2018, Hsiung and Kimura 2019). However, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">there remains considerable uncertainty, surrounding the role of changing oceanographic conditions on all anguillid eel population dynamics and further research is required in order to understand the influence of both natural climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic effects. <span class=""apple-converted-space""></span></p><p><em>Anguilla japonica</em>&#160;is the native host of the nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) that parasitises the swim bladder and has been proposed to affect survivorship and migration behaviour of non-native species. Japanese Eels, however, appear to show more evidence of acquired immunity&#160;and significantly reduced pathological effects&#160;than the European Eel (Knopf 2006) possibly because of longer historical exposure to this parasite (Münderle <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p><p>As with other anguillid eels, the upstream and downstream migration of the Japanese Eel has been impacted due to the presence of barriers in waterways. In Japan, construction of dams has reduced eel catches in some areas (Tatsukawa 2003).&#160;On 135 sampling sites in five rivers in Japan, individual density of Japanese Eel was negatively correlated with cumulative height of dams and weirs located in the lower reach of each sampling site (Ministry of the Environment 2016). Other studies investigated young yellow eels in a small river and reported density is negatively correlated with the number of weirs (Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019, 2020). Shuai <em>et al</em>. (2020) reported that dams could have blocked eel’s migration routes and affected their spatial dispersal.</p><p>Other threats include the loss of river habitat due to agricultural, urban and industrial development. Chen <em>et al</em>. (2014) used Landsat imagery to determine the amount of Japanese Eel habitat loss caused by human activity in 16 rivers across East-Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China). The study revealed a reduction in effective habitat area of 76.8% from the 1970s to 2010s, with the highest reductions in China (81.5%) and Taiwan (49.3%). In Japan, part of the reduction in river habitat has included the extensive revetment of the shorelines of rivers and lakes for flood control purposes (Yoshimura <em>et al</em>. 2005, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>). In a study comparing areas of natural shoreline to those with revetment, there was found to be lower abundance, poorer body condition, emptier stomachs, and reduced prey diversity within stomach contents, in eels sampled in areas of revetment (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>b</em>).&#160; </p><p>Development has also increased industrial effluent, and agricultural and urban runoff, all of which are known to negatively impact eel numbers through displacement, reduced reproductive success and direct mortality, particularly during the spawning migration (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). One example is organochlorines, primarily used in pesticides, which have shown to be persistent in aquatic environments even after their ban (Arai 2014). These chemicals are lipid soluble, and therefore accumulation was greater in silver stage <em>A. japonica</em> and eels that had resided for longer in freshwater (Arai 2014). In Lake Shinji, high concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticide effluent from rice paddies has been indirectly linked to the decline in average fishing yields of eel between 1981–1992 and 1993–2004, after its introduction in 1993 (Yamamuro <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may have been caused by a reduction in aquatic invertebrates, a prey source for <em>A. japonica</em> (Yamamuro <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160; </p><p>Predation of <em>A. japonica</em> naturally occurs in both continental and oceanic life stages. Miyake <em>et al.</em> (2018) studied the influence of predation on glass eel recruitment in the Tone River Estuary, through genetic identification of stomach contents. Glass eels were found in the stomachs of the channel catfish (<em>Ictalurus punctatus</em>) – an invasive species in the river system – and blackfin sea bass (<em>Lateolabrax latus</em>)<em> </em>confirming these species are predators of <em>A. japonica</em>. The level of influence of these predators on <em>A. japonica</em> is unknown, although blackfin sea bass occurs commonly in areas where glass eels recruit, and channel catfish may be a new predator, in rivers where its distribution has expanded.</p><p>                  </p><p>Disease may constitute another threat for <em>A. japonica</em>. Japanese Eel endothelial cells-infecting virus (JEECV) causes viral endothelial cell necrosis (VECNE), which has an experimental mortality of ~60% (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). Since the 1980s, this has caused economic loss within eel farms (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). Infection of wild caught <em>A. japonica</em> at both yellow eel (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2015) and elver (Okazaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) development stages has now been reported.</p><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p></p><p>Most population genetic studies have previously indicated that&#160;<em>Anguilla japonica</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;consists of one genetically homogenous, panmictic population (Ishikawa <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2001, <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Han <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Minegishi <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012, Gong <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2014). Recent research (Igarashi <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018), however, found genetic differences among eels captured in different rivers in Japan, providing some evidence to the contrary. However, Gong <em>et al</em>. (2019) did not find any genetic population differentiation between eels from China and Japan, suggesting the weight of evidence still supports panmixia at present. </span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Several studies using microsatellite analysis have suggested that Japanese Eel elvers show little genetic variation between years. A genetic study carried out by Tseng <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2003), for example, suggests that the effective population size (EPS) of the Japanese Eel is declining and the authors speculate that historically this has been due to large scale oceanographic changes. While EPS does not offer a true measure of the number of mature, reproductive individuals in the population, a reduction in this value suggests an overall loss of adaptive genetic variation. </span></p><p>Catch effort can be variable in fishing data, and under-reporting and, in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings, is a serious problem across the range of <em>A. japonica</em>. Thus, landings data of glass eels cannot be accepted as a precise measure of population status (Kaifu 2019). However, due to the large scale of landings data, it can to some extent reflect true changes in fishing yields and is still helpful to understand stock status. </p><p>To date, there is only one published stock assessment study of <em>A. japonica</em>. This study, by Tanaka <em>et al</em>. (2014), estimated stock size through ‘exploitable’ (yellow and silver) eel CPUE for Japanese inland waters, glass eel CPUE in Japan, and an age- and sex-structured model. Results from this study estimated that stock size of individuals aged ≥1 year had recovered since 1990 from less than 10,000 tonnes (t), to 18,700 t in 2010, equating to 24% of the carrying capacity. A study by Kaifu (2019) discussed some of the challenges facing a stock assessment of <em>A. japonica</em>. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) glass eel catches occur in Japan, making it difficult to assess the stock using this life stage, as the catch cannot be translated directly into recruitment (Kaifu 2019). For example, glass eel catch during the 2014 fishing season (1 November 2013 to 31 October 2014) totalled 17.4 t in Japan, but the total reported catch was only 8.0 t, 46.0% of the actual (Kaifu 2019). Other challenges arise when using catch statistics for yellow and silver eels. Particularly in inland waters where fisheries occur in Japan, stocking is known to take place, which biases eel abundance and their natural biological parameters. Using recently developed methods based on otolith stable isotope ratios (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>a</em>), research is beginning to highlight the scale of the presence of stocked eels in inland waters, and the necessity for their consideration within stock assessments (Ministry of Environment 2016, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu 2019).</p><p><strong>Glass Eels: </strong></p><p>The data sets used in the analysis were as follows: Ministry of Agriculture, Forest and Fisheries (MAFF) compiled glass eel data (Japan), CPUE (catch/fisherman) data sets collected from nine Japanese prefectures; Chiba, Aichi, Tokushima, Oita, Kagoshima, Shizuoka, Mie, Kochi, and Miyazaki. Glass eel catch in these prefectures accounted 70.5% of the entire reported glass eel catch in Japan in 2018 fishing season (November 2017 to October 2018).</p><p>According to MAFF statistics, inland and coastal area glass eel catch reported in Japan in 19<span class=""msoins0"">95 and 2019 – three generation lengths difference - was 20.0 t and 3.7 t, respectively, with large fluctuations between years. Indeed, at the time of writing, the catch in 2020 was higher than in 2019. However, fisheries catch does not necessarily reflect the abundance of the population because of potential fluctuation of fisheries effort. </span></p><p>Glass eel CPUE (glass eel catch per fisherman) in nine different Japanese prefectures <a name=""_Hlk8914205"">(data from Tanaka (2014) updated based on communications with the nine prefectures) in 1994 and 2018 was 0.4483 and 0.2365, respectively.</a> CPUE has decreased by 47.2% over 24 years (three generations). Based on GLM analysis, the glass eel CPUE in the nine prefectures has significantly decreased for both periods of 1977–2018 and 2003–2018 (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019).</p><p>The estimate of exploitation rate of glass eel (or elver) in an estuary in northern Taiwan indicated that this life stage was heavily fished, which will influence the population size of yellow/silver eels in the river (Tzeng 1984, Lin <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2017b, Lin and Tzeng 2018). </p><p><strong>Yellow/Silver Eels: </strong></p><p>The most recent FAO statistics (in 2017) suggest that landings are as low as 119 t although there is no indication of effort from these data (FAO 2019). In 2013 the Japanese Eel was assessed as 'Endangered' on the Japanese Red List (published by the Ministry of Environment, based on the catch data of inland eels compiled by the MAFF). This report indicated&#160;a 72–92% decline in the species over three generations (12–45 years). Total annual yellow and silver eel catch across the 47 prefectures significantly decreased from 1,413 t to 71 t during 1987–2017, a&#160;reduction of 95.0% over three generations (Anon. 1958–2018). A recent study using otolith Strontium isotope ratios (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) reported that the otolith ratios of spawning adult Japanese Eels captured at the spawning area were most similar to the ratios of Japanese water, rather than that of Korea, mainland China and Taiwan waters (Otake <em>et al</em>. 2019)<span class=""apple-converted-space"">. This indicates population dynamics of yellow and silver eels in Japan might be an appropriate indicator of the whole population dynamics<span class=""apple-converted-space""> of <em>A. japonica</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. Although the MAFF data suggest widespread declines across the 47 prefectures of Japan (Anon. 1958–2018), the data only consider eels in inland waters, i.e. rivers/lakes, and it is estimated that &#160;56–86% of Japanese Eels remain in estuarine/saline waters throughout their lives (<a name=""_Hlk17362227"">Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2002, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kotake <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mochioka <em>et al</em>. 2012, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2012</a>). It has been suggested that a latitudinal cline exists, in the degree to which Japanese Eels utilise either freshwater or saline environments in Japan and Taiwan (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). In southern regions, a higher proportion of eels enter freshwater habitats, whereas in northern regions more eels remain in saline habitats (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). This behaviour appears to coincide with productivity, and therefore food abundance, which is greater in marine environments in the north, and similarly in freshwater environments in the south (Tsukamoto and Arai 2001, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2009). </span></p><p><a name=""_Hlk8918551"">It is suggested that eel stocking in Japan has biased</a> assessments of the population dynamics of this species (Kaifu 2019). Otolith stable isotopes have been recently used to determine the proportion of stocked eels in some locations in Japan. In Okayama prefecture, 98.1% of sampled eels in three rivers where stocking had occurred were identified as stocked individuals (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). In the Tone River watershed, wild eel proportions differed with site, and dominance of stocked eels was highest closest to release sites, suggesting reduced dispersal of these individuals (Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018). A study by the Ministry of Environment of Japan found 62% of eels (n = 92) captured from 10 water systems in Japan to be stocked after application of a discrimination model (Ministry of Environment 2016, in: Kaifu 2019). Stocking affects population dynamics by introducing additional individuals into wild eel populations. Moreover, in an age-based cohort model, stocking-related ageing error strongly affected estimates of total biomass (Kullmann <em>et al</em>. 2018). <a name=""_Hlk7699981"">Data on eel biological characteristics, such as survival rate, growth rate and sex ratio, are essential for assessments of their population dynamics (e.g.</a> Tanaka 2014); however, these characteristics can differ significantly between naturally recruited wild and cultured-and-stocked eels (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019). Therefore, yellow and silver eel population dynamics should be investigated where the possible bias of eel stocking is expected to be relatively low to minimise error.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk7699853"">Japanese Eels are fished in both inland and coastal waters in Japan</a>, while eel stocking has been conducted only in inland waters. <a name=""_Hlk7699872"">The standardised yellow and silver eel CPUE was significantly decreased in four of the six fisheries cooperative associations in coastal and estuarine areas of Japan (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019). Significant relationships between CPUE and year were not found for the other two associations. </a>Catches between 2003 and 2016 in coastal waters of Okayama Prefecture, where naturally-recruited wild eels are dominant, peaked in November and December (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). This is when Japanese Eels start their spawning migration, although monthly catch and peak values were found to decrease over time, and longline and setnet CPUE decreased between 2003 and 2016 by 79.6%, and 79.5% respectively (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>). In addition, a survey of 1,509 fisheries cooperative associations in Japanese coastal waters where stocking of eels has not taken place reported that 93.4% of the 227 fisheries cooperative associations that confirmed they catch eels stated that they believe the Japanese Eel stock to be declining or relatively declining (Kaifu and Yokouchi 2019). </p><p>Han and Tzeng (2006) report an 81–88% female bias in sex ratio of yellow and silver eels caught at one locality, the Kaoping River, in south-western Taiwan. Furthermore, in the lower reaches of this river, density was revealed to be 0.01 eels/m²&#160;in 2001 and 2002 and the estimated abundance of eels in Kaoping River ranged from 7,137 to 31,360 individuals in 2001, and from 3,324 to 22,040 individuals in 2002 (Han and Tzeng 2006). Studies have found males to dominate at higher densities and so the low density and female bias in this River supports this theory (Han and Tzeng 2006). </p><p>                            </p><p>When considering all the available data on its multiple life-history stages, <em>A. japonica</em> is estimated to have suffered at least a 50% population decline over a period of three generations (24 years; see ‘Habitat and Ecology’).&#160;</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>It is known that <em>Anguilla japonica</em> occurs as a native species in Japan, China, Taiwan, Province of China (hereafter referred to as Taiwan) and Republic of Korea (hereafter referred to as South Korea). The range of this species extends from the Pacific coast of Japan and south to Hainan Island covering large areas of mainland China, Taiwan and South Korea. There are some records of recruitment along the coasts of the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea and in low abundance in Northern Luzon Island, Philippines, the Chao Phraya basin in Thailand and Cambodia. It is thought that these vagrant individuals might not contribute greatly to the population as they are outside the influence of currents that are essential to the successful completion of the life cycle.</p><p>Eggs and preleptocephali for this species have been collected in the North Equatorial Current (NEC) along the western side of the West Mariana Ridge (14–17<sup>o</sup>N, 142–143<sup>o</sup>E) to the west of the Mariana Islands and were captured during new moon periods (Tsukamoto 2006, 2009, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). Timings of egg and preleptocephali catch also overlapped with catch of breeding-condition adult eels from the same area, confirming this area, west of the Mariana Islands, as the spawning location for this species (Chow <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kurogi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The possible spawning depth of adult eels has been suggested to lie in a vertically narrow depth stratum of 150–200 m, just below the upper limit of the thermocline sitting at 150 m (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The NEC and Kuroshio Current are the predominant transport mechanisms for this species (Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2012) but the latitude of spawning events, varies between years depending upon oceanic conditions (Kimura and Tsukamoto 2006, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2014). Spawning is thought to occur between April and August (Shinoda <em>et al</em>. 2011). The early, vagrant recruitment of Japanese glass eels occurs around the north-eastern coast of Luzon Island in the Philippines in late October and then in greater abundance in Taiwan in early November, with the main fishing season there being between November and February (Han 2011). After two to four weeks, recruitment occurs in the Fujian Province of China and the Pacific coast of southern Japan, where the main fishing season is between December and February (Han 2011). In the Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces of China, Jeju Island, and Pacific coast of central Japan, the main fishing season occurs between January and March (Han 2011). From February to April, recruitment is concentrated in the southern Jiangsu Province of China (around Yangtze River estuary), the southern coast of South Korea, and east coast of Japan (Han 2011). In the northern Jiangsu Province of China and the west coast of South Korea, the main fishing seasons are between March and May (Han 2011). The final recruits occur on the north-western coast of South Korea and the Yalu River estuary in northern China between April and June (Cheng and Tzeng 1996, Han 2011, Han <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, recruitment peaks have been observed in June in 2010 and 2011 in the Pacific coast of central Japan (Aoyama <em>et al</em>. 2012). The results indicate that variations in the recruitment season may occur. &#160;</p><p>    </p><p>The natural range of <em>A. japonica</em> within countries such as Japan is difficult to determine because of widespread restocking activities. Recently, coastal regions of Kyushu, Seto Inland Sea, and in Honshu, the Pacific side south of Aomori Prefecture, and the Sea of Japan side south of Kyoto Prefecture, were identified as the main areas of distribution for naturally recruited yellow-phase <em>A. japonica</em> in Japan (Yoneta <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, South Korea and China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>Together with <em>A. anguilla</em> (the European Eel), <em>A. japonica</em> has one of the longest histories of fishing, stocking and farming for consumption purposes of all the <em>Anguilla</em> species. Japanese Eels are utilized/traded live, fresh, smoked, canned and frozen and eaten steamed, broiled and baked and also to some extent in East Asian medicines.&#160;<em>A. japonica</em> was historically caught in waters throughout its range, with large eels caught destined directly consumption or juvenile eels destined for farming, from the early 1900s onwards (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). </p><p>Global FAO catch data for the Japanese Eel is available for the period of 1950–2017. From the 1950s to 1986, annual catches (not life stage specific) fluctuated between 2,000 and 3,600 tonnes (t) (in 1969), averaging 2,600 t per year. From 1987 onwards reported catches gradually declined by 50–100 t on average per year, and in 2017 they were only 119 t. Over 90% of these catches were reported by Japan, with Taiwan and South Korea only reporting small quantities, and mainland China none. See ‘Population’ section for more detailed and national catch statistics for <em>A. japonica</em>.</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 t), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity and producing glass eels is not yet commercially viable. The preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em> and high demand for this declining resource has resulted in dramatic increases in price for this species. According to the Joint Press Release (Anonymous 2017) and other sources<em> </em>annual <em>A. japonica</em> glass eel input into farms in mainland China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan between 2008 and 2017 has declined significantly, however with some fluctuations between years (due to large variations in <em>A. japonica</em> glass eel recruitment), e.g. input was 24.1 t in 2012–2013, &#160;but then 98.5 t in 2013–2014. Declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years and this is particularly apparent during poor <em>A. japonica </em>recruitment years such as in 2012–2013 (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). See Shiraishi and Crook (2015) and Gollock <em>et al. </em>(2018) for a detailed analysis of <em>Anguilla</em> spp. and <em>A. japonica </em>farming production.</p><p>        </p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms, and <em>A. japonica</em> is believed to make up a significant proportion<em> </em><em>of this</em>. A detailed analysis of recent international <em>Anguilla</em> trade, including <em>A. japonica</em> is provided in Gollock <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p></p><p>Due to their broad geographic range and multiple life stages, conservation measures for <em>Anguilla japonica</em> can be challenging to implement. Research resources appear to have been focused on the aquaculture and ecology of oceanic life stages, although some recent studies have begun to address population dynamics (e.g. Tanaka 2014, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Fisheries Agency 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>b</em>, Kaifu 2019), habitat restoration (e.g. Chen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Yokouchi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>, Ministry of the Environment 2016, Kume <em>et al</em>. 2019) and restocking (e.g. Lin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>a</em>, Itakura <em>et al</em>. 2018) in order to promote conservation and sustainable use of Japanese Eels. </p><p>In 2003, a study was published documenting the first successful captive production of glass eels in Japan from reared larvae and the life cycle was fully closed in 2010 (Masuda <em>et al. </em>2012). For mass production of eels in Japan to become biologically and economically viable, however, better feed, disease prevention and a simplification and shortening of the rearing process are still required (Masuda <em>et al. </em>2012). In 2014, the Alliance for Sustainable Eel Aquaculture (ASEA) was established by Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan, under the structure of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), to increase collaboration, and discuss effective laws relating to eel resource conservation and management (Tzeng 2016). </p><p>In Japan, catch of juvenile eels is only permitted with a license, which is issued in order to capture seed for aquaculture or research within a limited fishing period. Illegal and unreported catch still remains a significant problem, with this catch potentially representing at least double the legal reported catch (Kaifu 2019). The capture of silver eels is prohibited or restricted in ten prefectures and voluntarily suspended in eight other prefectures, with the aim of&#160;preserving spawning eels in these areas. Restocking rivers and lakes with young eels for stock enhancement has also been carried out for many years in Japan.<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> However, stocking can disrupt population dynamics, through differences in survival and growth rates, and sex ratios between cultured/stocked and naturally-recruited wild individuals (Kaifu 2019). It may be that moving eels from one location to stock another, results in an inability to migrate to the spawning area (Westin 2003). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) concluded that huge knowledge gaps still exist as to the benefits of stocking, and further research and consistent monitoring is necessary to better assess and understand the effects (ICES 2016). </p><p>In China, the numbers of fishing licenses are restricted. In Taiwan, a regulation to control export of juvenile eel was introduced in 2007, banning export between November and March (Shiraishi and Crook 2015). The last available information for glass eels used for farming showed in 2014–15 the harvesting period was reduced to four months (1<sup>st</sup> November 2014–28<sup>th</sup> February 2015) (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">With a view to protect eel habitat, Yilian County, historically the major glass eel harvest region, has prohibited fishing (Han 2018). In addition, catch of young and larger eels has already been prohibited in 33 rivers of other regions (Han 2018). Regulations have been amended with regard to the control of eel farming activities since November 2014 (Han 2018). The Fisheries Agency reviews and updates the amount of glass eels to be input by fish farmers annually, and each fish farmer is subject to the control and management of a license system and individual input limit (Han 2018). The upper limit for glass eel input for Japanese Eel is set at 10 metric tons (Han 2018). Japanese Eel are also stocked into rivers (Han 2018). <em>Anguilla japonica</em> has recently been listed on the Red List of Taiwan as Nationally Critically Endangered (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2017).</span></p><p>At the international level, co-operation among Japan, China and Taiwan began in 2012, who aimed to establish strengthened management of Japanese Eel fisheries as well as the introduction of traceability schemes. In September 2014, a ‘Joint Statement’ was adopted by China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, for the conservation and management of the Japanese Eel, through a restriction on the amount of eel seed that can be used in aquaculture production annually (Anonymous&#160;2014).&#160;Based on the Joint Statement (Anonymous&#160;2014), the annual input of Japanese Eel seed since the 2015 season (1 November 2014–31 October 2015) has been limited to 78.8 t, 80% of the input in the 2014 season. The same input quota has been still in place up to the 2020 season (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2019<em>b</em>). The actual quantities reportedly used for aquaculture were lower than the quota: 37.8 t and 40.8 t in the 2015 and 2016 seasons, respectively (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). From 2017 onwards, a complete data set is not available.</p><p>The Philippines has legislation that applies to trade of all anguillid species (i.e. export ban on juvenile eels ≤15cm in length), though <em>A. japonica</em> is a very low proportion of catches in this range State (Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>            </p><p>In summary, there has been a focus to date on fisheries regulation for <em>A. japonica</em>, and interventions relating to the many other threats facing the species are essential.</p><p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Within this broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. The species has a conservative life history, producing only one pup on average every 1–3 years and likely has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. The Spinetail Devil Ray is a large component of targeted fisheries and a bycatch of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated as <em>Mobula </em>species. The depths and regions used by the Spinetail Devil Ray coincide with many artisanal and industrial fisheries raising concerns about previously unreported and continued bycatch. Steep population declines are evident in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including India and Indonesia. The lack of species-specific catch records, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess some population reductions, however notable declines in landings of 50–96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. The Spinetail Devil Ray has a widespread global range and in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and strong fisheries management. The Spinetail Devil Ray is used locally and sometimes nationally, and often traded internationally, with the rise of the valuable gill plate trade increasing pressure on the species. Unlike for some of the other mobulid species, the development of localized marine protected areas is unlikely to provide this species any significant protection from fisheries due to its large-scale movements.&#160;Based on actual levels of exploitation, steep declining population trends, a conservative life history, and the increasing trade demand, a global population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years) is suspected, with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056). The Spinetail Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Endangered (A2bd+3d).</p></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>  </p><p>The Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is a pelagic species that resides in coastal and continental shelf waters. It spends the majority of its time in less than 50 m of water but occasionally dives to depths of 1,112 m (Canese <em>et al.</em> 2011, Croll <em>et al. </em>2012, Holcer <em>et al.</em> 2013, Francis and Jones 2017). The species exhibits large-scale movements, up to 1,800 km at minimum speeds of 63 km per day likely driven by seasonal patterns in prey availability  (Freund <em>et al. </em>2000, Canese <em>et al.</em> 2011, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2012, Francis and Jones 2017). <span lang=""en-GB"">The species reaches a maximum size of 350 cm DW (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020), with significant geographical variation in size across its  distribution. Males mature at 200–220 cm disc width (DW) and females  mature at 215–240 cm disc width (DW). Reproduction is aplacental  matrotrophic with a gestation period of 12 months, and generally a  single large pup (though two per litter occur occasionally) of 90–160 cm  DW. The reproductive cycle is 1–3 years, with resting periods between  pregnancies in some years (White <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160;Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al.</em>  2018, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2018).

These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines. Their coastal and offshore distribution, and tendency to aggregate makes mobulids particularly susceptible to bycatch in purse seine and longline fisheries, targeted capture in artisanal fisheries, and incidental entanglement (Croll <em>et al.</em> 2016, Duffy and Griffiths 2017).</p><p></p><span lang=""en-GB""><p><em>Mobula</em> rays, including Spinetail Devil Rays, are caught in at least 13 targeted artisanal fisheries in 12 countries.

Despite a broad worldwide distribution, populations appear to be patchily distributed. Abundance also appears to vary substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they have been, or are currently being, fished. Like many mobulid species, the Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is often solitary but may aggregate in large numbers to feed or reproduce. Abundance estimates have been attempted with aerial surveys in some areas like the northwest Mediterranean Sea, where a population of up to 12,700 individuals was estimated (Fortuna <em>et al</em>. 2014, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the population trend is unknown, but it is suspected to be decreasing.<br/><br/>In India, population reductions are suspected based on declines in devilray catches, while effort has increased in several regions, including Kerala, along the Tuticorin coast, and Mumbai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012). Landings data from trawlers operating out of Mumbai revealed maximum landings of 6.3 tonnes (t) for '<em>M. diabolus</em>' (an invalid name, possibly referring at least in part to the Spinetail Devil Ray) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which time fishing effort almost doubled. From this decline in catch and increase in effort, local population declines can be inferred. Such declines are unquantifiable to species-level given the potential grouping of several species under one synonym and the difficulty of identification. In Sri Lanka, fishermen have reported declines in mobulid catches over the past 5 to 10 years as targeted fishing pressure has increased (Fernando and Stevens 2011). Data collected since 2011 shows a steady decline in both 2013 and 2014, although fishing pressure has either remained stable or increased (D. Fernando unpubl. data). Overall, the rate of population reduction of devilrays appears to be high in the region. The scale and effects of devilray fisheries in Sri Lanka and India suggest considerable population reduction regionally (Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, mobulids have been increasingly targeted in many countries, most notably the Philippines and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula </em>spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;declined by 96% in Tanjung Luar, and by 50% in Cilacap (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Spinetail Devil Ray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Intense, directed fisheries (over 22 active fishery sites) for mobulid species have existed in the Philippines, particularly the Sulu Sea, for over a century with steep historical declines suspected based on fishing effort and landings data (Alava 2002, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). As in Indonesia, depletion is suspected in areas, although targeted fishing continues in some locations (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Throughout most of its range, populations of the Spinetail Devil Ray appear to be in decline, due to directed fishing and incidental capture as bycatch. Declines can be inferred in many regions based on declines in landings or sightings concurrent with increasing effort (Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Regional extinction is suspected in areas with intense and increasing fishing pressure (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). In some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and in the former two countries, strong fisheries management. Globally, based on current levels of exploitation and declining population trends, the suspected population reduction is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056).",Decreasing,"<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>The Spinetail Devil Ray is circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters throughout all oceans. Notably, it is present in the Mediterranean Sea but absent in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017) and its occurrence is patchy throughout its distribution (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).

The meat from mobulids is often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles). Mobulids including the Spinetail Devil Ray are used in aquarium display  tanks, e.g. in some Gulf countries (R.

Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, protocols for safe release, and codes of conduct for responsible tourism are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.

Egg clutches found within drilled tunnels by ship-worms are attended by the male (Sazima and Carvalho-Filho 2003). There is an apparent sexual dimorphism with males showing a higher dorsal fin and prominent flap on its anterior edge.  Territorial males adopt a dark colour while flashing the bright turquoise spot of the dorsal fin.  Contests are size-dominated and may be restricted to displaying dark colours and turquoise spot, or the opponents may enter in physical combat, nipping at each other.

178201678,161545,Narcine prodorsalis,Endangered,A2d,2021,2020-10-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tonkin Numbfish (<em>Narcine prodorsalis</em>) is a small (to 40 cm total length) numbfish with a patchy distribution in the Indian, Western Central Pacific, and the Northwest Pacific Oceans ranging from India to China, including Sri Lanka, Java, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. It is demersal on the continental shelf down to a depth of 100 m. This species is bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with and likely has a low post-release survival rate. Inferred and suspected declines over three generation lengths (14 years) based on landings of sharks and rays range from 22–82% and fishing pressure is high across much of its known range. The species is rarely recorded, and it is unknown if this is due to natural rarity, unrecorded captures, or as a result of fishing pressure causing population reductions. Dramatic declines have been documented in populations of similar species, where they are heavily fished. It is suspected that the Tonkin Numbfish has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (14 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The Tonkin Numbfish is a small species that reaches at least 40 cm total length (TL) and occurs on the continental shelf to a depth of 100 m (Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is viviparous but nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data. The Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Tonkin Numbfish (93 cm vs 40 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 4.5 years for the Tonkin Numbfish.","This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline, and mostly discarded. Post-release survival is likely low, as Narcine species are soft bodied and easily damaged (Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>In India, there are high levels of fisheries exploitation. There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen et al. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including of elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Sri Lanka, fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 14,000 vessels in 1950 to 63,745 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since 2000 and &gt;90% of the fleet subsistence and artisanal fisheries operating in coastal fisheries on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The coastal fisheries are likely to be increasingly overfished due to the high fishing effort with offshore fisheries increasing in effort since the early 1980s (Samaraweera and Amarasiri 2004, Dissanayake 2005).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia catches the highest number of chondrichthyans in the world with the catch of rays rising as shark fisheries collapse. In 2003, rays comprise over 50% of chondrichthyan landings, up from 32% in 1981 (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). Since the 1980s, demersal trawls are the dominant gear followed by purse seines and small-scale gear (Pauly and Liang 2019). In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).","There is no information on the population of this species, but it is apparently very patchy within its range and only very rarely recorded. It is unknown if this is due to natural rarity or as a result of fishing pressure causing population reductions. It is caught as bycatch in India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020) and likely also in Sri Lanka where fishing pressure is heavy and intensifying (O’Meara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although the species is typically discarded, the numbfishes are thought to suffer from high post-release mortality. The population of the Tonkin Numbfish is suspected to have declined off India due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing pressure. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990–2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 63% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009).<br/><br/>Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. While not a whipray, the Tonkin Numbfish is in a similar depth range and susceptible to the same fishing gears as whiprays, thus the catch trends of whiprays are suspected to be similar to that of numbfishes. Catch of whiprays increased throughout Indonesia starting in the 1960s. In central Indonesia, whipray catch increased by 550% throughout the early-1970s to 2000, from 30 tonnes to &gt;200 tonnes per year (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch decreased 45% since the early 2000s (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Research surveys from 1976 to 1997 shows more than a 90% decline in ray catch per unit effort throughout the Java Sea in 20 years (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). With the increased catch through parts of Indonesia there has also been increased effort and therefore, catch per unit effort (CPUE) is likely decreasing, suggesting an overall decrease in the population of chondrichthyans (White and Dharmadi 2007).<br/><br/>There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, and China Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Zeller and Pauly 2016, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, reconstructed landings data showed a five-fold increase over the 65 years from 1950 to 2014. Total catches have fluctuated greatly but continued to rise overall with foreign catches within the Sri Lanka EEZ increasing from the mid-1980s (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). A population trend cannot be inferred as effort has also increased during this period.<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, the reconstructed landings showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Zeller and Pauly 2016). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). Additionally, in China, anecdotal reports suggest a decrease in the size of sharks and rays captured (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019), which reflects the broader trend across all fish stocks of smaller sized fish being landed in China as a result of fishing down the ecosystem; a consequence of intensive fishing that changes the size composition of the catch (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>When these inferred and suspected declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Tonkin Numbfish (13.5 years), they represent declines of 63%, 65%, 82%, and 22% in India, Indonesia, Viet Nam, and China, respectively. These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Tonkin Numbfish. Dramatic declines have been documented in populations of similar species, where they are heavily fished. Overall, based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (13.5 years).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"The Tonkin Numbfish has a patchy distribution in the Indian, Western Central Pacific, and Northwest Pacific Oceans ranging from India to China, including Sri Lanka, Java, Indonesia, and Viet Nam (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Numbfishes are not consumed as human food and presumably discarded due to their small size (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016).,Marine,"No species-specific conservation measures are in place. In Indonesia in 1980, trawls were banned, however, large numbers of mini or baby trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong <em>et al</em>. 1987). In 2015, an additional ban on seine nets (Cantrang) was to be fully implemented in February 2020 (Ambari 2019). There are currently plans in place to lift both these bans in the near future, where the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) plan will allow the operation of the fishing gear with restrictions on the area of fishing pressure (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). Throughout Indonesia there are 196 MPAs making up 239,428 km2 that may provide some refuge to this species (CTI 2020). Most MPAs in the region are not well enforced and unlikely to provide any tangible relief from fishing pressure.<br/><br/>In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12°N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang unpubl. data 2019). Since 2017, enforcement of the seasonal closure has strengthened (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). The effectiveness of the closures is debatable as overfishing remains a threat (Yu and Yu 2008, Pauly and Liang 2019). It is estimated that ~20% of the Chinese coastline is included in Protected Areas (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Tonkin Numbfish, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest measures. Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification).

It is retained and sold fresh, dried or smoked. There is no species-specific population trend data, although reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, and Nigeria Exclusive Economic Zones infer declines 32–89 % over the past three generation lengths (21 years). These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region and most of these steep declines have occurred in the past decade. West African fisheries are likely to be depleted and butterfly ray populations have declined dramatically in the region.<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that the Seret’s Butterfly Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (21 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure, and hence it is assessed as Endangered A2d.</p>","<p>Seret’s Butterfly Ray occurs on sandy and muddy habitats and also enters estuaries ranging from the surface to a depth of 60 m (Yokota and Carvalho 2017, L. Yokota pers. comm. 14/06/2020).&#160;It is likely to reach a maximum size of approximately 100–110 cm disc width (DW), though the largest measured specimen was 74.8 cm DW (Yokota and Carvalho 2017); males mature at 33.8–45 cm DW and females mature at 66.5 cm DW (Yokota and Carvalho 2017). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous and size-at-birth is estimated at 18–22 cm DW (Yokota and Carvalho 2017). Generation length is inferred from the larger Spiny Butterfly Ray (<em>Gymnura atavela</em>), which is 11 years (see Spiny Butterfly Ray Red List assessment), and this was scaled down to 7 years to account for the smaller size of Seret’s Butterfly Ray.</p><p></p>","<p>The species is taken as bycatch, and possibly targeted, in industrial and small-scale fisheries with multiple gears, including trawl, gillnet, and beach seine net, and retained for its meat. In Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, elasmobranchs were first exploited by semi-industrial fisheries during the 1950s, although these fisheries gradually collapsed (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Elasmobranchs were also caught as bycatch by small-scale fisheries and the flesh salted and dried for consumption. The total artisanal total fishing effort increased by 10-fold between 1950 and 2010 (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). Industrial fisheries have increased with demersal and shrimp trawlers dominating with more than 64% of the total number of industrial vessels increasing from 190 vessels in 1950 to 1,200 vessels in 2010 (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). The reported landings of elasmobranchs has risen steadily since the 1950s and the mid-1990s (Walker <em>et al. </em>2005). Sharks and rays constitute 1–2% of all reconstructed catches, and a large fraction of the catch is reported in the Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem with nearly one-quarter taken by Morocco and a significant fraction taken by Nigeria (D. Belhabib pers. comm. 25/08/2020).&#160;Elasmobranch meat is an important source of protein for many countries in Africa (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). A large market for salted and dried flesh is centralized in the Gambia and Mauritania region where a Ghanian community operates an export business to Ghana via Senegal. Guinea and Mali import important quantities of smoked elasmobranch flesh from the West Africa region.&#160;Overall, there has been a 34% decline in total catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) between the 1950s and the 2000s, driven mainly by 60% decrease in the artisanal CPUE (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). <br/></p><p>In Central Africa, fishing pressure on both sharks and rays is significant. For example, in Gabon, even if there is no fishery focused on sharks and rays, they are caught daily. For example, in 2018 sharks and rays catch represented 6.3% of the trawling total catch, with at least 3,900 individuals per fishing trip (6o tonnes of total catch for 28 days at sea and 115 trawling operations) (G. De Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).</p>Seret’s Butterfly Ray&#160;was recently described but it is assumed that general patterns for butterfly ray catches apply to it as well. Butterfly rays were formerly common all along the West African coast. Seret's Butterfly Ray may be targeted along with other benthic sharks and rays and caught in large mesh benthic gillnets targeting guitarfishes in West Africa. Butterfly rays are taken as bycatch of industrial bottom trawl and shrimp trawl gear and in artisanal fisheries using demersal-set gillnets and longlines (I. Seidu, G.H.L. Leurs and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). In Ghana, they can comprise 1.5% of rays captured in demersal trawls. In the artisanal fishery, in Gabon, in 2018 Seret’s Butterfly Ray were&#160;caught by longlines in the delta of Ogouée with a CPUE of 41.2 kg/day per fishing boat, representing 15.9% of the catches (G. de Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). The pressure on Gymnuridae seems low, with less than 0.1% of rays observed but their catch is regular and it is the importance of both Dasyatidae and Rajidae catch that explain the apparent low catch rate and pressure upon Gymnuridae.&#160;However, without proper time-series of catch data for this species, we cannot exclude that this low rate of catches is due to a collapse of the population resulting from the higher fishing pressure in the past&#160;(G. de Bruyne and E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020).&#160;These fisheries are not managed over a large portion of this species range and are intense and increasing in many areas. There is a long history of heavy fishing pressure throughout this species' inshore and shallow water habitat that is unlikely to be reduced in the coming years (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data 2007, 2020).","<p>There are no species-specific trend data for this species. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (Walker <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks, rays, and skates have been reconstructed for the Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, and Nigeria Exclusive Economic Zones, based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, they can  be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased  while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. </p><p>In Senegal, reconstructed landings showed a 30% decline, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Guinea-Bissau, reconstructed landings have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 22% decline over the years from 2012 to 2016. Historically, catches gradually rose 6-fold from 782 t in 1962 to 5,001 t in 1997 then steeply rose to a peak of 17,181 t in 2012 followed by a fluctuating decline to 13,485 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort increased during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This recent steep decline in landings is associated with a 27% decrease in CPUE from 2012 to 2016. <br/></p><p>In Ghana, reconstructed landings have been rising since the 2000s but showed a 27% decline over the years from 2013 to 2016. Historically, catches gradually rose from 154 t in 1950 to 15,536 t in 1975 then declined to 1,122 t in 1997, then rose steeply to a peak of 12,858 t in 2013 followed by a fluctuating decline to 9,422 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). Effort rose very steeply in 2002, but plateaued in 2010, and hence the recent decline in catch may represent signs of population collapse. In Nigeria, reconstructed landings have been rising since the 1970s but showed a 19% decline over the years from 2010 to 2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 2,419 t in 1950 to 25,144 t in 1980 then rose to a peak of 31,273 t in 2010 followed by a fluctuating decline to 25,396 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has remained stable during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This steep increase landings coincides with a steep rise in fishing effort and an overall 50% reduction in CPUE&#160; from 1980 to 2016. <br/></p><p>Although large butterfly ray individuals are still landed sometimes from Mauritania and south to Guinea, artisanal fishers and other observers indicate that the abundance has dropped severely and that the median size has been dramatically reduced as most of the adults have been removed by fishing activities (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). Even in the Banc d'Arguin National Park, Mauritania, target captures occur and consist of more than 90% juveniles and subadults while large individuals were common in the 1980s (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). Pregnant Seret's Butterfly Ray females have been observed in the landings of artisanal coastal fisheries in Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea-Bissau, suggesting that this species is giving birth in coastal shallow waters, where the fishing pressure is intense (M. Ducrocq unpubl. data&#160;2007). Juvenile butterfly rays (up to 30 cm disc width) can still be seen very close inshore in Gabon (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020). This species is still commonly captured in Ghana (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020), but rare in Congo and Cameroon (P. Doherty and A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>When the reconstructed landings declines are scaled to the conservative three generation lengths of the Seret’s Butterfly Ray (21 years) they represent population reductions of 89%, 72%, 89%, and 32% in Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, and Nigeria, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in rays in the region. West African fisheries are likely to be depleted and butterfly ray populations have declined dramatically and hence, it is suspected that a population reduction of more than 50–79% has occurred in the past three generation lengths (21 years).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Seret’s Butterfly Ray occurs throughout the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola (Yokota and Carvalho 2017,&#160;M.

It occurs near the surface in temperate waters and deeper, below the thermocline, in tropical waters. The species has low biological productivity with limited fecundity and late age-at-maturity. Although no longer targeted, it is still caught as bycatch in trawl, trammel nets, and set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines. The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade. Across regions, there have been some severe  historic decline, however there are indications of some stability  and possible slow recovery since cessation of target fishing and high levels of protection.  The global population may now be beginning  to stabilize, with signs of that from the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere there is little information upon which is assess stability.<strong> </strong>However, abundances  are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is  ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a global population reduction of 50–79% is suspected over the past three generations (102 years). Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Basking Shark is a planktivorous coastal-pelagic species named for its habit of swimming slowly at the surface but it also vertical migrates to depths of 1,264 m (Gore <em>et al. </em>2008). It occurs in temperate and tropical waters, but in temperate waters it is present near the surface and in tropical and equatorial waters, it occurs deeper, below the thermocline (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dewar <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is the second largest shark after the Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>)  and reaches a maximum estimated size of 1,276–1,973 cm total length  (TL) (Parker and Stott 1965, Holden 1974, Weigmann 2016). The species  aggregates in coastal waters, with aggregations of up to 1,398  individuals observed in the northeast United States, and it also undertakes large-scale  migrations (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009, Witt <em>et al. </em>2014, Doherty <em>et al.</em> 2017, Crowe <em>et al. </em>2018, Dewar<em> et al.</em>  2018). Males mature at 400–750 cm TL, females mature at 690–980 cm  TL, and size at birth is estimated at 150–200 cm TL (Matthews and Parker  1950, Parker and  Stott 1965, Pauly  1978, Compagno 1984, Sims&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Fowler 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013,  Francis 2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an  estimated gestation of 12–36 months and a likely resting period of two  years between litters (Parker and Stott 1965, Pauly 1978, 2002; Compagno 1984). Only one litter of 6 near-term pups has been reported  (Sund 1943). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 16–20 years (18  years average) and maximum age is estimated at 50 years; generation  length is therefore 34 years (Compagno 1984, Pauly 2002, Fowler 2005).  Annual rate of population increase is estimated at 0.013–0.023 and  natural mortality is low at M = ~0.07 per year (Pauly 2002,  Fowler 2005).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Currently there are no target fisheries for the Basking Shark, however it was targeted for several centuries by harpoon and net fisheries for meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and liver oil (Rose 1996, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018, SARA 2019). Surface fisheries have primarily caught large, recently-mated females (CITES 2002). The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade being worth up to US$57,000 for a single, large fin (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2004, Magnussen <em>et al. </em>2007). Targeted fisheries were banned in many countries during the 2000s (ICES 2016, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018).  The species is still taken as bycatch by trawl, trammel nets, and  set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines (Fowler 2005,  Mancusi <em>et al</em>. 2005, COSEWIC 2009, Francis and Smith 2010, Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis and Lyon 2012, Murua <em>et al</em>.  2013, ICES 2018). Many range states across its distribution now have  regulations that require release of live individuals (see Conservation section).  Strikes from recreational and commercial shipping are a threat due to  the species' habit of spending time at the surface (Pirotta <em>et al. </em>2019). Collisions from recreational boats are relatively frequent in United Kingdom waters (OSPAR 2009).&#160;</p>","<p>There are no data on the absolute global population size, although it is likely to be greater than 20,000 individuals (and thus not approaching the thresholds for criterion C: small population size and decline).

Landings within  ICES Subareas 1–14 peaked in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s at around 5,000  tonne (t), declined rapidly during the 1980s to less than 1,000 t  annually, after which there was a peak in 1992 of 1,697 t, followed by a rapid decline. There is evidence of serial exploitation and depletion patterns in different ICES Subareas during this fishery. For example,  the artisanal Achill Island fishery, which targeted Basking Sharks in a  single bay with rowing boats, nets, and hand harpoons, declined rapidly after a  decade of high catches during the 1950s and 1960s, and Basking Sharks did not return to this location (CITES 2002). Following the ban on target Basking Shark  fisheries in 2006–2007, landings  declined to &lt;30 t annually and have  been &lt;0.1 t since 2013  (ICES 2018). There are no effort data or catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data available for recent  years (ICES 2018) which means caution  is required in the interpretation of these data for population abundance  trends.<strong>&#160;</strong>However, the large catch declines during the  1960s to 1980s are believed to reflect unsustainable fishing levels and a  decline in population abundance (CITES 2002, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since then, public record sightings and boat  surveys in  the U.K. for 1988–2008 suggest population recovery following  cessation  of targeting in the mid-2000s, based on decreased sightings of  small  Basking Sharks and increased sightings of medium-sized and large  sharks  (Witt <em>et al. </em>2012). However, when current research  survey  encounter rates are compared with historical target fishery catch   rates, the population is estimated to be well below 30% of historical   abundance, although it is suspected to be stable and possibly increasing in   European waters (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the Japanese target Basking Shark fishery of the 1960s and 1970s,  estimates of catches (in numbers) severely declined during the mid-1970s from a high of about 100 individuals per year until the  fishery closed in the early 1980s, with catches since then at, or near, zero (Uchida 1995, Yokawa 2017). These data are unusual, having records of the same catch (100 sharks) annually from 1967 to 1974 followed by a 50% increase in 1975 and an 87% decrease in 1976, with no information on effort; hence they must be interpreted with caution. In New Zealand, the SPUE over the period 1985–2015 peaked in 1988–1991, which may  have been due to Japanese trawl vessels targeting sharks during that time, but since the mid-2000s catches have been at, or near, zero. The reason for this decline cannot be definitively determined as it may be indicative of changed fishing practices,  regional shifts in availability of Basking Sharks, or a real abundance  decline (Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis 2017). The Japanese and New Zealand data may not be reliable indices of abundance.</p><p>Further to the landings and SPUE data above, there are estimates of population  changes from five regions: Northwest Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Southwest  Pacific. In the Canadian Northwest Atlantic, declines were estimated in  the Bay of Fundy between 2008 and 2011 based on aerial and boat surveys  from different studies, although direct comparison between the two  abundance estimates is constrained by different estimation methods  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore,  population models in 2008 suggested a 23% probability that the abundance  was decreasing, although there was high uncertainty in the model data  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008). In United States Atlantic waters, there has been no evidence of decline since 1979 (Campana <em>et al</em>.  2008). Population trends in the  Mediterranean Sea are unknown, but it is suspected that the Basking Shark  has declined by at least 50% over three generations (Sims <em>et al. </em>2016).  In temperate waters of the Southwest Atlantic, Basking Shark were  historically common and are now rare (Soto 2000, Lucifora <em>et al. </em>2015).  In the Northeast Pacific, the Basking Shark was persecuted as a  destructive 'pest' and although targeted fisheries ceased in the  1970s,  the abundance is considered to still be at a historic low with fewer  than 6 sightings per year off the coast of British Colombia (Wallace and Gisborne 2006, McFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Dewar <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Southwest Pacific, the New Zealand Threat Classification  System found that the Basking Shark was Vulnerable based on the criteria that the population size within New Zealand is likely to be &lt;5,000 mature individuals, with a predicted decline over three generations of 10–50% (Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong></strong>Across  these regions, there have been some severe historic declines, however, the global population may now be beginning to stabilize, following cessation of target fishing, high levels of protection, and indications of recovery (particularly in the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere we have little information upon which is assess stability). Recovery is expected to take  hundreds of years due to the low biological productivity of Basking  Shark, exacerbated by the removal of adult females by target fisheries (CITES 2002). Abundances are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a 50–79% global  population reduction is suspected over the past three generations (102 years).  Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Basking Shark occurs mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; in the Indian Ocean, it is reported only from southern Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fahmi and White 2015).</p>","<p>No utilization or commercial trade of this species is currently known to exist, although prior to 2012, meat and fins were exported from Norway and fins from New Zealand.  No  commercial trade records have been noted in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade database  since 2012, although not all trade records may be reported to CITES.  However, it is likely that if caught, the meat would still be used fresh for  either local consumption or exported internationally along with the  fins.</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. The Basking Shark was among the first shark species listed under several wildlife treaties. Many fishing nations worldwide and the European Union protect Basking Sharks through wildlife conservation legislation or apply zero quotas under fisheries management regulations.<br/><br/>In 2002, the Basking Shark was added to Appendix II of CITES, which requires Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2005, the Basking Shark was listed on Appendix I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which respectively, obligates Parties to strictly protect the species and to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted its first ban on directed Basking Shark fisheries in the Convention Area. This measure has since been regularly renewed; the current ban, adopted in 2015, expires at the end of 2019 and will be reconsidered based on scientific advice (ICES 2016). There are a range of conservation measures in the UK, along with a recommended Basking Shark code of conduct (OSPAR 2009). The Basking Shark is listed on Appendix II of the Bern  Convention for the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Basking Shark and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Basking Shark retention and landings be prohibited, at least as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Initiatives to avoid contact, prevent capture, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties (MarLIN 2018).<br/><br/>Basking Shark tourism is managed in some locations but if sustainable tourism industries are indeed to be developed around encounters with these sharks, they should be legislated, continuously monitored, and enforced with permitting systems to make sure operators and tourists are adhering to best practice protocols and codes of conduct.</p>    <p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 1–600 m but is most commonly found at 200–350 m. It is captured in industrial trawl fisheries for hake, industrial deep-water crustacean trawl fisheries, and artisanal bottom longline fisheries that encompass most of the geographic and depth range of this species, although with patches of refuge in southern Chile. Exploratory fisheries began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter, catches subsequently increased steadily and then ramped up in 1993 as a direct result of the arrival of Korean skate traders who provided a market that incentivised fishers to target and retain this species for international trade. Despite quota management since 1997, the fishery peaked in around 2003 and landings started to decline until the target fisheries were closed in 2016.&#160;Currently, the major source of mortality comes from the Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>) bottom longline fishery, in which Yellownose Skate might be considered a secondary target comprising 40% of overall catch. There may be some refuge for the species in the extensive coastline of southern Chile which consists of many fjords and canals where fishing activities are not operating at present. The stock assessment reveals that overall biomass has decreased by 51% in 27 years from 54,629 tonnes in 1979 to 26,900 t in 2006. The trend analysis of total biomass for 1979–2006 (27 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 73.1% over three generation lengths (52.5 years), with the highest probability (95%) of a 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths. There is long history of overexploitation, ongoing bycatch mortality, limited spatial refuge and large body size and slow life history combined with an estimated population reduction of &gt;73.1% over three generation lengths (52.5 years), and the Yellownose Skate is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>","<p>The Yellownose Skate is demersal on the continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 14–476 m, but is most commonly found between 200–350 m (Vargas-Caro<em>&#160;et al. </em>2015, Concha <em>et al.</em> 2018, E. Acuña pers. comm. 2019) occasionally reaching 600 m (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 158 cm total length (TL) (Vargas-Caro<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015, Concha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019); males mature at 86 cm TL and&#160;females mature at 106 cm TL&#160;(Vargas-Caro<em>&#160;et al. </em>2015). Reproduction is oviparous and an annual reproductive cycle is assumed, incubation period is 252&#160;± 9.4&#160;and size-at-hatching is 17.2 cm TL (Concha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;Female age-at-maturity is 14 years and maximum age is 21 years; generation length is estimated to be 17.5 years (Licandeo <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>The Yellownose Skate was formerly targeted, driven by export demand from Korea, and it now faces bycatch fishing pressure since the target fishery was closed in 2016.&#160;Formerly this species was caught in (1) the artisanal multi-species longline fishery off central and southern Chile, (2) bycatch in commercial fisheries for South Pacific Hake&#160;(<em>Merluccius australis</em>), (3) in artisanal fisheries for Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and deep-sea industrial trawl fisheries for crustaceans. Currently, the major source of mortality comes from the bottom longline Pink Cusk-eel fishery, in which Yellownose Skate might be considered to be a secondary target comprising 40% of overall catch.</p> Since 1979 there were industrial and artisanal landings in Chile of &gt; 4,000 tonnes per year of Yellownose Skate and&#160;Roughskin Skate (<em>D. trachydermus</em>). These two species were not separated in catch landing statistics until 2003 (Vargas-Caro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Between 1999 and 2000, there was an important increase in mainly artisanal landings with a maximum landing of 4,151 t during 2000, which then dropped to 3,000 t in 2001 and has been declining since (Vargas-Caro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). South of 41°28.6'S, both&#160;Yellownose Skate&#160;and&#160;Roughskin Skate<em>&#160;</em>are taken as bycatch in commercial fisheries for South Pacific Hake and in artisanal fisheries for Pink Cusk-eel<em></em>. Captures in 2002 were of ~2,000 t for both&#160;Yellownose Skate&#160;and&#160;Roughskin Skate combined and since 2005 there have been quotas put in place in these southern fishing grounds. Before the fishery was closed, in the artisanal multi-species longline fishery off central and southern Chile (39°15' to 41°28.6'S) the catch was regulated by quota for Yellownose Skate&#160;and&#160;Roughskin Skate. Since 2000, 30% of artisanal landings within this fishery (between IX and X Regions) have been monitored and comprise 85% Yellownose Skate, 10% Roughskin Skate, with the remaining 5% made up of&#160;<em>Bathyraja </em>spp<em>. </em>and what was identified at the time as <em>Rajella sadowskii</em>&#160;(Lamilla&#160;<em>et al. </em>2001, 2002).&#160;<br/> <br/> Yellownose Skate&#160;is also a minor bycatch of the Chilean deepsea crustacean trawl fisheries for Yellow Squat Lobster (<em>Cervimunida johni</em>) and the deep-sea Chilean Nylon Shrimp (<em>Heterocarpus reedi</em>) (Acuña and Villarroel 2002).<br/><br/>Overall, despite the cessation of the targeted fishery, this skate is still in demand, is captured in large numbers through much of its range, and has little refuge at depth.","<p>There are no population estimates for this skate. Industrial trawl fisheries for hake, industrial deep-water crustacean trawl fisheries, and artisanal bottom longline fisheries encompass the entire geographic and depth range of this species, although with patches of refuge in southern Chile. The target fishery was closed in 2016 but this species is still taken as significant retained bycatch, particularly in the Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>) bottom longline fishery, and also the South Pacific Hake (<em>Merluccius gayi</em>)&#160;and artisanal longline fisheries. <br/><br/>Initial landings in late 1970s and early 1980s were due to exploratory fisheries. While variable, landings subsequently increased steadily as a direct result of the arrival of Korean skate traders in 1993, who provided a market that incentivised fishers to target and retain this species for international trade. The fishery peaked and landings started to decline after around 2003 (Vargas-Caro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;The target fisheries were closed in 2016.&#160;The major source of mortality comes from the Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>) bottom longline fishery, in which Yellownose Skate might be considered to be a secondary target comprising 40% of overall catch (F.

The extensive coastline of southern Chile consists of many fjords and canals where fishing activities are not operating at present.<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from stock assessment that&#160;reveals that overall biomass has decreased by 51% in 27 years from 54,629 tonnes in 1979 to 26,900 t in 2006 (Quiroz 2005).&#160;The trend analysis of total biomass for 1979–2006 (27 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 73.1% over three generation lengths (52.5 years), with the highest probability (95%) of a 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Yellownose Skate occurs in the Southeast Pacific Ocean and is endemic to Chile, ranging from central Chile to the Strait of Magellan (Gabbanelli&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Concha <em>et al.</em> 2019) (32°S to 56°S).</p>",<p>The Yellownose Skate is landed whole and then frozen and traded to Korea for the ‘Hongeo’ market.

In the west, it ranges from Cape Hatteras, United States of America to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and in the east, it ranges from&#160;Mauritania to Angola, and possibly South Africa.&#160;It occurs in lagoons and estuaries, and is often associated with coral reef ecosystems ranging down to depths of 60 m.<br/><br/>This species is commonly taken in industrial and artisanal fisheries using demersal trawl, shrimp trawl, demersal set gillnets, and beach seine nets. Its swimming behaviour makes it susceptible to a range of fishing gear throughout the water column, especially inshore gillnets, of which there are intensive fisheries throughout most of its range. This species is taken in target artisanal gillnet fisheries and as a retained bycatch of industrial shrimp trawl fisheries. It is retained and sold fresh and consumed locally.<br/><br/>In the southern Gulf of Mexico, fisher interviews report declines from 30–40 rays per night/trip from 1990 to 2000, but currently fishers are only catching around 10–15 rays per night/trip, equivalent to a population reduction of 38% over three generation lengths (30 years). In Belize, however, relative abundance was stable from 2009 to 2018. While the population of this species may be stable in United States waters and in the Caribbean Islands, it is inferred to be declining in <span class=""st"">central and northern South America and is inferred to be Near Threatened there.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to concerning declines in other species, and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been reduced in numbers there. This eagle ray was commonly caught in&#160;gillnets in 1995 in&#160;Pernambuco (Brazil), but landings have declined&#160;by about 80%&#160;since then. Artisanal fishery monitoring that occurred in São Paulo between 1996 and 2002 only recorded five individuals, and fishers confirmed in interviews that this species has declined there. It is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) in the Atlantic South American part of its range.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, there have been very few records of this species over the past decade from the Republic of Congo and Gabon. There are no recent records of this species in Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Nigeria, Cameroon or Angola. The lack of recent sightings, despite numerous records of other rays with similar biology and catchability, suggests this species may have largely disappeared from West Africa, and hence, it is suspected that a population reduction of more than 80% has occurred in the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that the Whitespotted Eagle Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure, and therefore it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</p>","<p>The Whitespotted Eagle Ray is benthopelagic over the continental shelf from the surface to 60 m depth (Last&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It frequently enters lagoons and estuaries and is often associated with coral reef ecosystems (Ajemian <em>et al.</em> 2012, Bassos-Hull <em>et al. </em>2014). It reaches a maximum size of approximately 230 cm disc width (DW); males mature at 127–129 cm DW and females mature at 134.9 cm DW (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is matrotrophic viviparous and litters of 1–5 pups, with an average of 3, are produced annually after a 12-month gestation and size-at-birth is estimated at 18–36 cm DW (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012, Last&#160;<em>et al. 2</em>016).&#160;Generation length is inferred from the slightly larger (300 cm DW) Spotted Eagle Ray (<em>Aetobatus ocellatus</em>) which has a generation length of 12 years (Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2016), and this was scaled down to 10 years to account for the smaller size of the Whitespotted Eagle Ray.</p>","<p>Whitespotted Eagle Rays occur in coastal inshore waters where fishing pressure is substantial through portions of the species' range, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic Ocean along the coast of Africa. The species often enters estuarine waters where fishing pressure is high. The swimming behaviour of this species makes it susceptible to a range of fishing gear throughout the water column, especially inshore gillnet fisheries, which are intensive throughout most of its range. This species is taken in target artisanal gillnet fisheries and industrial shrimp trawl fisheries.<br/><br/>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, artisanal directed fisheries for Whitespotted Eagle Ray are not well described throughout its range but are known to exist in Mexico (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al.</em> 2011), Cuba (Cuba NPOA-Sharks 2015), and Venezuela (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed; this ray is taken there using gillnet, longline, and trawl gears (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia unpubl. data 2018);. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015), and this species is targeted in artisanal fisheries there (Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Declining annual catch rates have been demonstrated for fisheries in Mexico and Venezuela (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al. </em>2011, Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). <br/><br/>Third, in&#160;the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.</em>&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (e.g., False Shark Ray (<em>Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis</em>)&#160;from the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Kyne&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Sharks and rays are still targeted in a number of countries with artisanal fishers using drift gillnets and demersal set gillnets with large mesh sizes (e.g., Mauritania, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon; M. Diop, I. Seidu, A. Tamo, and A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In general, fishing effort and the number of fishers has intensified in recent decades across most of the range of this species. For example, in West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (FAO 2000, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, CCLME 2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977 to 2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Further, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries and destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between 1950 and 2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels (mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) operating in this region by 2010 (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).<br/><br/>Given their naturally molluscan diet, negative interactions with shellfish farming are episodic and anecdotally reported in the Northwest Atlantic (McEachran and Carvalho 2002, M. Ajemian pers. obs. 2019). Confirmed interactions generally stem from molluscan culture operations in the Indo-Pacific such as have also been reported for conspecifics such as&#160;<em>A. narutobiei</em> in Japan (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2005). While never implemented for Whitespotted Eagle Ray in the United States of America (USA), predator culling programs have been considered for other myliobatid species in the USA, notably Bat Ray (<em>Myliobatis californicus</em>) off California (Gray <em>et al. </em>1997) and Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera bonasus</em>) in Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere in the USA (Grubbs <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/>Whitespotted Eagle Ray is a popular public aquarium species and is collected for the marine aquarium trade (Swider&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Since this species routinely enters estuaries this species may also be threatened by pollution, dredging, and habitat loss.<br/></p>","<span class=""st""><p>Population trend data for the Whitespotted Eagle Ray are available from Belize based on baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) (G. Clementi and D. Chapman, unpubl. data 2019) and a survey in Mexico (J-C. Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generation lengths (see the attached Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, in the Western Central Atlantic, artisanal directed fisheries for Whitespotted Eagle Ray&#160;are not well described throughout its range but are known to exist in Mexico (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al. </em>2011), Cuba (Cuba NPOA-Sharks 2015), and Venezuela (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012). Declining annual catch rates have been demonstrated for some of these fisheries (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al.</em> 2011, Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the southern Gulf of Mexico, fisher interviews report declines from 30–40 rays per night/trip from 1990–2000 but currently fishers are only catching ~10–15 rays per night/trip (Cuevas-Zimbrón <em>et al.</em> 2011, J-C. Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). The relative abundance time-series based on baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs) from 2009<span class=""st"">–2018 (G. Clementi and D. Chapman unpubl. data) indicated that abundance increased over the time series at a rate of 7.5% annually. Data from Mexico from 2000–2014 suggests a decline of 0.95% annually. When both data sets are considered, the annual rate of change is an increase of 1.32%, with an increasing population over three generation lengths (30 years), and the corresponding probabilities fall primarily into the Least Concern category (72%).<br/><br/>This species is encountered in catches in Colombia but there are no time-series data (Mejía-Falla and Navia 2019). In Venezuela, declines in the abundance of rays, including this species, were reported as far back as the early 1970s (Ginés&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1972, cited in Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), and they are currently still targeted in unmanaged artisanal gillnet fisheries there (Tagliafico<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). These fisheries are suspected to be causing further reductions in population size in the area. Data are sparse in the Guianas, but it is suspected that there have been reductions in the population there as a result of the level of artisanal and commercial fishing pressure. While the Whitepotted Eagle Ray population may be stable in United States (US) waters and in the Caribbean Islands, it is suspected to be declining in central and northern South America and hence is suspected to be Near Threatened there.<br/><br/>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, there are no data from northern Brazil, but commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have led to concerning declines in other species, and there is no reason not to suspect that this species has also been reduced in numbers in that area. This eagle ray was commonly caught&#160;gillnets in 1995 in Pernambuco (Brazil), but landings have declined since then by about 80% (F.M. Santana pers. comm. 25/05/2018). Artisanal fishery monitoring that occurred in São Paulo between 1996 and 2002 only recorded five individuals, and fishers confirmed in interviews that this species has declined there (S. Montealegre-Quijano <span class=""st"">pers. comm. 21/05/2018). Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, and noted declines and rarity in some areas, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50<span class=""st"">–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) in the Atlantic South American part of its range.<br/><br/>Third, in Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher.&#160;Overall across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch per unit effort (CPUE) has decreased by 71% from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Simultaneously,&#160;the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased.<br/><br/>In Mauritania, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased by 246% over 1992–2015 (23 years). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,918 t in 1950 to 9,916 t in 1979 then declined to 6,302 t in 1991, then rose steeply to a peak of 17,015 t in 2015 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020). These increases in landings are congruent with the fishing effort that has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). While effort has been stable, catches have continued to increase. In Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed at least a 30% decline, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001–2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). In Guinea-Bissau, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates data have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 22% decline over the years from 2012–2016. Historically, catches gradually rose 6-fold from 782 t in 1962 to 5,001 t in 1997 then steeply rose to a peak of 17,181 t in 2012 followed by a fluctuating decline to 13,485 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years from 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2020).&#160;There are no other estimates of population reduction&#160;available&#160;from this region.<br/><br/>There have been very few records of this species in the past decade in Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic. There was a single specimen caught in a pilot project in the Republic of Congo, but none captured in the years of regular sampling since (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2020). This is despite regular catches of Cownose Ray (<em>Rhinoptera marginata</em>) and Duckbilled Eagle Ray (<em>Aetomylaeus bovinus</em>) each month, albeit at low levels of abundance. There was another sighting in Songolo, but this species is clearly very rare in the Republic of Congo (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020). There are no recent records of this species in the Parc National du Banc D’Arguin, or more generally in Mauritania (G.H.L. Leurs and M. Dia unpubl. data 2020), Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, or Sierra Leone (M. Diop, J. Dossa and G.H.L. Leurs unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There were no records of this species from trawl fishery observer data in Gabon (E. Chartrain unpubl. data 2020) and only two records recorded from Songolo, Congo over 2 years of landing site surveys and one record in Mayumba, Gabon over 8 years of landing site survey (G. De Bruyne unpubl. data 2020).&#160;There have been no records in Ghana, however, there are few shallow fishing gears likely to take this species. Nevertheless, these fishing gears do capture butterfly rays which would have a similar shallow soft sediment habitat and catchability as eagle rays, and suggests the eagle rays may already have disappeared (I. Seidu unpubl. data 2020). There are no recent records from Nigeria, but it is possible that this species is present in commercial landings, but the catch composition information is aggregated and cannot be identified to species level. This species might have been sighted once on a commercial vessel (A.B. Williams unpubl. data 2020). There were no records from a landing site survey in Cameroon (A. Tamo unpubl. data 2020) and for occasional landings site surveys in Angola (A-L. Soares unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, they can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. When the reconstructed landings decline in Senegal are scaled to the conservative three generation lengths of the Whitespotted Eagle Ray (30 years) they represent a population reduction of 53% in Senegal. This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks and rays in the region.&#160;The lack of recent sightings suggests this species may have largely disappeared from West Africa, and hence, it is suspected that a population reduction of more than 80% has occurred in the past three generation lengths (30 years).<br/><br/>Taking the available evidence together, this species is inferred to be regionally Critically Endangered in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic; Endangered in the Southwest Atlantic; and in the <span class=""st"">Western Central Atlantic, Least Concern in <span class=""st"">US waters and Caribbean Islands, and Near Threatened in <span class=""st"">central and northern South America. This species has little geographic refuge from fishing within its range and does not have refuge at depth outside of Western Central Atlantic.&#160;Overall, the Whitespotted Eagle Ray is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing pressure and hence is assessed as Endangered A2bd.</span></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"The Whitespotted Eagle Ray occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. In the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic it ranges from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean Islands (Last <em>et al. </em>2016, Sales <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic this species is thought to range from&#160;Mauritania south to Angola, and possibly South Africa (Sales <em>et al.</em> 2019, Fricke <em>et al. </em>2020).",<p>This species is consumed locally or sold fresh or salted and dried. It is highly valued in eastern Venezuela where it is used in traditional cooking (Tagliafico&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). It is a popular public aquarium species.</p>,Marine,"<p>Fisheries taking Whitespotted Eagle Ray are generally unmanaged throughout large parts of the species' range and will likely not decrease in these regions in the near future. Although some countries, such as Cuba, have adopted National Plans of Action to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability.&#160;The development and implementation of management plans (local, regional, national and/or international, e.g. under the FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks [IPOA-Sharks]) are important tools for the conservation of elasmobranch species. Anon. (2004) updated progress made towards development and implementation of National Plans of Action for countries across the range of the Whitespotted Eagle Ray however, by 2011, only 13 of the top 20 shark-fishing nations had completed and implemented NPOAs for elasmobranchs (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">In West Africa, a number of countries have either adopted a Regional Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks (Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission countries from Mauritania to Sierra Leone, including Cape Verde) or are currently working on developing a National Plan of Action (e.g., Liberia) to conserve sharks and rays and manage their fisheries for sustainability under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA). However, progress towards the implementation of these actions have stalled since 2011 due to lack of funding and support (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Regional Marine Protected Areas Network in West Africa (RAMPAO) was set up in 2007 across six countries (Mauritania to Sierra Leone) to conserve representative samples of critical habitats and protect threatened species but many of these protected areas lack capacity, funding, infrastructure and governance for effective enforcement and conservation (Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that they provide a refuge for this species. In fact, shark and ray fishing has been prohibited in the Parc National du Banc d’Arguin in Mauritania since 2003 but sharks and rays are still frequently landed as bycatch (M. Diop unpubl. data 2020). Other countries such as Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, and&#160;Côte d'Ivoire&#160;are in the process of expanding their marine protected areas coverage, however, financial and technical support will also be required to ensure they can be enforced and that they promote connectivity and protect key life history stages (K. Metcalfe unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>This species is protected in Florida state waters under the Florida Administrative Code, with the purpose of increasing public awareness of the need for extensive conservation action. As such, the Whitespotted Eagle Ray cannot be harvested, possessed, landed, purchased, sold, or exchanged in Florida. Similar actions in other United States of America (USA) states or countries could contribute to conservation of the species. In Bermuda, a small recreational fishery persisted briefly before protection was enacted in 2010.&#160;In a few parts of its range the species faces lower levels of threat. These include Florida, USA, where the species is protected in state waters and Bermuda and the Bahamas where recent protection for sharks and rays has been put in place. Spotted eagle rays are an important attraction for diving ecotourism in certain areas (ie. Mexico [Quintana Roo], Bahamas and the Florida Keys) and therefore important to consider protecting in these high ecotourism zones (Cerutti-Pereyra <em>et al.</em> 2018). Campaigns to promote responsible ecotourism with these rays should be considered a positive driver for spotted eagle ray conservation.<br/><br/>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","",,false,false,Global

It is a wide-ranging species inhabiting continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from inshore to 90 m deep. The Bonnethead Shark&#160;is likely a species complex, with three distinct elements:&#160;the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (United States of America (USA), Bahamas, and Mexico), the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic&#160;(Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and the&#160;<a style="""">Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.&#160;</a>The species has among the highest population growth rates calculated for sharks, making it much less sensitive to fishing mortality than most other species of sharks. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. Despite its high productivity, drastic inferred declines have been reported throughout its range. The Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico) is stable due to management and in that region is assessed as Near Threatened. The Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic portion of the population has been reduced substantially in size. This shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s off the Caribbean Colombia, but is now very rare. In Brazil, this species was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro, collapsed in São Paulo, and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state, and fishers describe this species as being depleted and the species in that region is assessed as Critically Endangered. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including Bonnethead Shark, in the 1990s. Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca. This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. Its recent absence from large parts of its range in Central and South America and rarity of recent records across this part of its range infer that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) and it is assessed in that region as Critically Endangered. Overall, the combination of low fishing mortality in throughout the USA, declines in Atlantic Central America, combined with widespread disappearance in Southwest Atlantic and Pacific this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing and habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and shrimp aquaculture, and hence it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>The Bonnethead Shark inhabits continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from shore to 90 m depth (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 150 cm total length (TL).&#160;The life history of this species has received considerable attention. Empirical data for populations of this species in the eastern Gulf of Mexico reveal a latitudinal increase in maximum size, size-at-maturity, and offspring size (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, males mature between 68–85 cm TL (2 years of age) and females generally mature between 80–95 cm TL (or 2–3 years of age) depending on geographic area. Reproduction is placental viviparous and annual, with a litter size of 4–16 pups and size-at-birth of 35–40 cm TL. The gestation period of this species is one of the shortest known in sharks, lasting ~4.5–5 months (Parsons 1993, Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al. </em>2003). Demographic studies of this species by Cortés (2002) indicate that Bonnethead Shark have very high rate of population growth (mean = 1.304 per yr; 95% confidence interval = 1.150–1.165 per yr) making them one of the most productive species. In the Gulf of Mexico, maximum observed ages are 5–6 years or more for males and 7–8 years or more for females (Lombardi-Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2003). Recent work off the southeastern coast of the United States has produced validated maximum age estimates of 16.0 years for males and 17.9 years for females (Frazier <em>et al. </em>2014). Generation length is estimated to be 12 years.</p><a></a>","<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><p>First, in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic,&#160;Bonnethead Shark is captured in primarily in gillnets, demersal trawls and recreationally on hook and line. Recreational catches averaged 12,898 individuals from 2012 to 2016 and commercial landings averaged 15,305 lbs dressed weight from 2011 to 2016. Bycatch in shrimp trawls averaged 167,981 individuals from 2007 to 2011.</p><p>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, a<span class=""text"">rtisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is the fourth most commonly-caught shark in artisanal longlines and gillnets (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em><span class=""text"">2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2015). Gillnets and artisanal longlines are prevalent along much of Brazil's coast, and this species is captured by them (Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2014).

Artisanal fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965). Later research has revealed that this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California and that very few records have come from the southern portion of Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). Further south in this portion of the species' range, heavy artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place, and there are unmanaged commercial longline and trawl fisheries off parts of western Central and South America.<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""> This  species may also suffer from&#160;habitat loss due to coastal development  and the conversion of mangrove forest to shrimp aquaculture is  detrimental to this species.<br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></span>","In the United States, highly significant genetic differences were observed among Bonnethead Shark from the Atlantic coast of Florida, Gulf coast of Florida, and southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Escatel-Luna <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trend data are available from broad-scale trends in relative abundance for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (Peterson <em>et al.</em> 2017), a fishery-independent demersal trawl survey (Pollack 2018), and stock assessments for the US south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (NMFS 2013). The trend data was analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al.</em> 2018, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;<span><span><br/><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span>First, in the Northwest Atlantic, Bonnethead Shark is a very abundant, small hammerhead found in shallow estuaries and bays. It is caught as target and bycatch in gillnet fisheries, and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. In the United States, Bonnethead Shark had undergone declines prior to management measures, and since the 1990s scientific surveys have demonstrated large increases in abundance. A stock assessment for the Gulf of Mexico and US south Atlantic found the stock was not overfished but some sensitivity analysis suggests it was overfished. The weighted overall population trend for the Northwest Atlantic estimated a 40% increase over 3 generation lengths (36 years). However, outside the United States (where quota management used), Mexico (where a closed season is implemented), and the Bahamas (where there is no shark harvest), where management may not exist, the species is captured in artisanal fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp trawl and lobster fisheries (e.g. juvenile sharks in Costa Rica). There is a directed fishery in Quintana Roo, Mexico where the species is the third most important catch. It is present in landings in Cuba, Belize (mostly adults), Trinidad, and Panama (third most abundant species in gillnet fisheries). Expert judgement elicitation found that given the uncertainty in levels of harvest and its sustainability, Bonnethead Shark should be assessed as Near Threatened in this region.&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Second, the&#160;the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&#160;portion of the population has been reduced substantially&#160;in size. Off Caribbean Colombia, this shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s, but is now very rare (P.A. Mejía Falla and A.F. Navia/Squalus Foundation unpubl. data 2018). In Venezuela, this species remains among the most commonly caught shark but is subjected to heavy and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has suspected to have declined there as a result of levels of exploitation. This situation is expected to be similar across The Guianas. In Brazil, Bonnethead Shark was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro (Bizzeril and Costa 2001), collapsed in São Paulo (Bressan <em>et al. </em>2009), and Vulnerable in Espírito Santo State due to overfishing&#160;(Passamani and Mendes 2007). There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state. Although several individuals were recorded there in a 2012–2013 study, the only other record since the 1980s is one from 1995 (Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). Overall in Atlantic South America, this shark was formerly common or even abundant in the 1970s, has been and still is subjected to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure, and there have been very few recent records in Brazil. It is therefore inferred that the Atlantic South American portion of this species' population has undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernandez-Carvallo 1967). Artisanal fisheries there began targeting large predatory sharks prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965), and in the 1970s and 1980s the use of gillnets increased rapidly. After depleting the large predatory sharks, these fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including this species, in the 1990s (Sala <em>et al.</em> 2004). Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. There are more recent records in Colombia and Ecuador, but they are rare (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). There were records in the industrial trawl fishery in Colombia in the 1990s, but surveys of this fishery in 2007 did not record any <em>Sphyrna</em> species. This species is rare in gillnet and beach seine catches in Ecuador (A. Cevallos unpubl. data 2019). Overall in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, due to heavy and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, its recent absence from large parts of Mexico and Central America, and rarity of recent records across this part of its range, it is inferred that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (36 years).&#160;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><span></span><span><p>Overall, the combination of low fishing mortality in throughout the USA, declines in Atlantic Central America, combined with widespread disappearance in Southwest Atlantic and Pacific this species is inferred

lang=""EN-GB"">The Bonnethead Shark occurs in the both the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans.&#160;This is likely a complex of three geographically discrete three species: (1) the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico), (2) the Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic&#160;(Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and (3) the&#160;Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. In the Atlantic it ranges from Rhode Island, USA, to at least Bahía in Brazil and possibly Uruguay and in&#160;the Pacific it from southern California to Peru (Ebert<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013, D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019, D. Chapman unpubl. data 2020).</p><p></p>","Bonnethead Shark are utilised for their meat and fins. Meat is consumed or sold locally and the fins are traded internationally (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2020). Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014–2015, Bonnethead Shark makes up 0.06% of the fin trade (Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"<p>In the USA in 2006, National Marine Fisheries Service finalized the Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Federal Management Plan. This Federal Management Plan includes a range of management measures including quotas and seasonal closures. Bonnetheads are managed under this plan. There are also coastal gillnet bans in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas which will also provide protection for the species.&#160;</p><p>In Mexico, there is a closed season for the shark fishery in May and June in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Quintana Roo, and May 15 to June 15, and August 1–29 in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatán. The Official Standard NOM-029-PESC-2007 establishes management measures that finning prohibited and the protection of some species (whale shark, white shark, basking shark, sawfishes, and species of Mobula). It also establishes that fishing is prohibited at the surrounding area of 5 km of coral reef areas, at adjacent areas in front of mouth rivers and coastal lagoons (delimited by a semicircle of 2.5 km in the mouth), and at nursery areas (prohibited the use of gill-nets in June) in front of Playa Bagdad, Tamaulipas. There is a marine protected area of 30 km from the mouth of the Rio Bravo to Conchinal; Terminos lagoon, Campeche; Usumacinta-Grijalva Rivers, Tabasco; Yalahau lagoon, Quintana Roo; and Espiritu Santo and Ascension Bays, Quintana Roo. There is also a Management Plan of the Natural Protected Area “Marine Biosphere Reserve of the Mexican Caribbean” that prohibits any elasmobranch fishery in all this biosphere reserve that comprises all Mexican Caribbean. There are enforcement problems.&#160;</p><p>In the Central America and Dominican Republic, the Regional Office of Fisheries of the Sistem of Integration of Central America, prohibit Shark Finning with the resolution OSP-05-11 in all of the Central American countries (from Belize to Panama), including the Dominican Republic.</p><p>In the Guatemalan Caribbean, there are fishing bans for one month (usually August) for the capture sharks (Families: Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Triakidae, and Ginglymostomatidae) and two months (usually July and August) for rays (Family Dasyatidae). However, enforcement of these bans is a challenge.</p><p>In Honduras, there is a national regulation (Governmental Degree 107-2011) that declared the territorial waters of Honduras a shark sanctuary. Fishing and exploitation of all shark species was prohibited in all territorial waters of Honduras. This regulation was revised by a new regulation (Governmental Degree 26-2016), which indicated that sharks that are incidentally caught can be used. There are enforcement problems.</p><p>In Panama, there are some marine protected area in the middle and west of Panama, which can benefits shark populations because it establishes management in these areas like fishery controlled areas. However, enforcement is a challenge. In 2006, a regulation was approved that prohibited shark finning in Panama water. In 2017, another regulation was implemented for longline fisheries (e.g. limits of number of hooks up to 1,000 per surface longline strand).</p><p>In the Bahamas, longline fishing was banned in The Bahamas in 1993, and peak elasmobranch export occurred the same year (UN FAO). The export steadily declined until the last export of any elasmobranch product from The Bahamas occurred in 2004 (UN FAO). The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary was established in 2011 (Haas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017), and it is currently illegal to fish for, land or possess any sharks or shark parts in The Bahamas. This protection does not extend to rays or skates. Enforcement is very underfunded and inadequate, making it possible that exploita on may be occurring at present or in the future.</p><p>The Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago developed draft NPOA – Sharks in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. However, for Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, these are still in draft form due to a combination of factors including lack of political will. For the Dutch Caribbean, spatial management measures have been implemented. The Yarari Marine Mammal and Shark Sanctuary was created in 2015 for Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba in the Caribbean Netherlands. In November 2011, the Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks (MoU Sharks) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species.&#160;</p>In the Southwest Atlantic, this species is listed in the Brazilian Ordinance of Ministry of the  Environment Nº 445, which restricts all harvest and trade of species  listed as Endangered or Critically Endangered on the Brazilian National  Red List (Feitosa <em>et al.</em> 2018). This legislation came into force  in December 2014, however, it was suspended for all of 2015 and the  first half of 2016 due to pressure from the fishing industry (Begossi <em>et al. </em>2017).  The ordinance faces increasing industry pressure, including a court  challenge to suspend the legislation again, by the Secretaria Nacional  de Aquicultura e Pesca (SAP), who brought forward their contention that  the Brazilian National Red List was designed specifically for  terrestrial species (Spautz 2019). In the Eastern Pacific, there&#160;are no species-specific protections or  conservation measures in place for Bonnethead Shark in the Pacific  portion of its range. <p>  </p><p>To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.</p>  <p></p>","",,false,false,Global
